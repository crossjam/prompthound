&lt;h1&gt;EFF's videoconferencing backgrounds (&lt;a href="#do-not-consent"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Telework is a quiet reminder that we live, in some sense, in an age of wonders. As terrible as lockdown is, imagine it without any way to videoconference with your peers and colleagues.

But it's also a moment where we tremble on the precipice of cyberpunk dystopia, when calls for mass surveillance - both for epidemiology and stabilizing states that are bruised and reeling - meet a world where &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is online and amenable to "collection" by spooks.

This is, basically, the moment that EFF has been warning about for 30 years: the moment when the "digital world" and the "real world" fully merge, and where the distinction between "tech policy" and "policy" dissolves.

One way you can help keep this in your colleagues' minds is to use EFF's amazing, free/open graphics as your videoconferencing background (most of these are the creation of the brilliant Hugh D'Andrade).

Now, those are all great, but this one is Room 641A at AT&amp;amp;T's Folsom Street center, where the whistleblower Mark Klein was ordered to build a secret room so the NSA could illegally spy on all US internet traffic.

&lt;a name="piketty"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Luis_XVI_Callet-660x350-1516570388.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The ideology of economics (&lt;a href="#piketty"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the 21st Century" advanced a simple, data-supported hypothesis: that markets left to their own will cause capital to grow faster than the economy as a whole, so over time, the rich always get richer.

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2014/06/24/thomas-pikettys-capital-in-t.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2014/06/24/thomas-pikettys-capital-in-t.html&lt;/a&gt;

He's followed up Capital with the 1000-page "Capital and Ideology" - whose thesis is that the "laws" of economics are actually policies, created to "justify a society's inequalities," providing a rationale to convince poor people not to start building guillotines.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/ET-f88VUYAAg5hD.jpg"&gt;

The first ideology of capital was the "trifunctional" system of monarchist France, dividing society into "those who pray," "those who fight," and "those who work."

After the French revolution, we enter the capitalist phase, then social democracies, and now, "meritocracies."

"Meritocracies" invest markets with the mystical power to identify and elevate the worthy, in a kind of tautology: those who have the most are worth the most. You can tell they're worth the most because they have the most.

("That makes me smart" -D. Trump)

In Piketty's conception, "Inequality is neither economic nor technological. It's ideological and political," where "ideology" "refers to a set of a priori plausible ideas describing how society should be structured" (think: Overton Window).

&lt;a href="https://bostonreview.net/class-inequality/marshall-steinbaum-thomas-piketty-takes-ideology-inequality"&gt;https://bostonreview.net/class-inequality/marshall-steinbaum-thomas-piketty-takes-ideology-inequality&lt;/a&gt;

The major part of the book seeks to explain how the post-war social democracies gave way to the grifter meritocracies of today, pulling together threads from across the whole world to tell the tale.

On the way, he described alternatives that were obliterated, and others that were never tried, and shows how "meritocracy" gave us Trump, xenophobia, Brexit, and the Current Situation.

In particular, he's interested in why working class people stopped voting (spoiler: they no longer perceive that elites will pay attention to them irrespective of how they vote) -- and what it would take to mobilize them again.

The elites' indifference to working people is grounded in an alliance between the Brahmin Left (educated, well-paid liberals) and the Merchant Right (the finance sector). Notionally leftist parties, like the Democrats, are dominated by the Brahmin Left.

But more than any other, Macron epitomizes this alliance: proclaiming his liberal values while slashing taxes on the wealthy -- punishing poor people for driving cars, exempting private jets from his "climate" bill.

Life in a "meritocracy" is especially cruel for poor people, because meritocracies, uniquely among ideologies, blame poor people for poverty. It's right there in the name. French kings didn't think God was punishing peons, rather, that the Lord had put them there to serve.

"The broadly social-democratic redistributive coalitions of the mid-twentieth century were not just electoral or  institutional or party coalitions but also intellectual and ideological. The battle was fought and won above all on the battleground of ideas.”

As Marshall Steinbaum writes in his excellent review, Piketty's work doesn't just highlight new ideas in economics: it highlights the intellectual poverty of the economics profession and its tunnel vision.

"Economists cannot be allowed to be the arbiters of the intensely political concerns Piketty takes up in the book, and the good news is that there is reason to believe they won’t be."

&lt;h1&gt;LoC plugs Little Brother (&lt;a href="#lb-loc"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Honored and pleased to have my book Little Brother included on the Library of Congress's excellent collection of open-access ebooks in its collection, which you can always access gratis but which may be of especial interest during the lockdown.

&lt;a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2020/03/more-open-ebooks-routinizing-open-access-ebook-workflows/"&gt;https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2020/03/more-open-ebooks-routinizing-open-access-ebook-workflows/&lt;/a&gt;

If you enjoyed Little Brother and its sequel Homeland, you might be interested in the third Little Brother book, Attack Surface, which Tor is publishing on Oct 12.

&lt;h1&gt;Canada nationalizes covid patents (&lt;a href="#c13"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Canada's Parliament has passed Bill C13, "An Act respecting certain measures in response to COVID-19," amending patent law to create automatic compulsory licenses for any inventionused to fight covid, including diagnostics, vaccines, therapies or PPE.

&lt;a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/bill/C-13/third-reading"&gt;https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/bill/C-13/third-reading&lt;/a&gt;

As E Richard Gold writes, it's an "important signal that Canada will not support IP delays...While most firms are helping find solutions, this will prevent those who try to take advantage-by raising prices or limiting supply-or those who cannot deliver to block what is needed."

&lt;h1&gt;Exponential Threat (&lt;a href="#exponential-threat"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

"Exponential Threat" is a remarkable - and factual - political ad, one that contrasts Trump's statements on coronavirus with the spread of the disease in America.

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkMwvmJLnc0"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkMwvmJLnc0&lt;/a&gt;

More remarkable: Trump has threatened to sue the media for airing it, which is a totally cool and normal thing for someone who has sworn a solemn oath to uphold the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to do.

Currently writing: I'm getting geared up to start work my next novel, "The Lost Cause," a post-GND novel about truth and reconciliation.

Currently reading: Just started Lauren Beukes's forthcoming Afterland: it's Y the Last Man plus plus, and two chapters in, it's amazeballs. Last month, I finished Andrea Bernstein's "American Oligarchs"; it's a magnificent history of the Kushner and Trump families, showing how they cheated, stole and lied their way into power. I'm getting really into Anna Weiner's memoir about tech, "Uncanny Valley." I just loaded Matt Stoller's "Goliath" onto my underwater MP3 player and I'm listening to it as I swim laps.

&lt;h1&gt;EFF's videoconferencing backgrounds (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/26/badger-masks/#do-not-consent"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Telework is a quiet reminder that we live, in some sense, in an age of wonders. As terrible as lockdown is, imagine it without any way to videoconference with your peers and colleagues.

But it's also a moment where we tremble on the precipice of cyberpunk dystopia, when calls for mass surveillance - both for epidemiology and stabilizing states that are bruised and reeling - meet a world where &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is online and amenable to "collection" by spooks.

This is, basically, the moment that EFF has been warning about for 30 years: the moment when the "digital world" and the "real world" fully merge, and where the distinction between "tech policy" and "policy" dissolves.

One way you can help keep this in your colleagues' minds is to use EFF's amazing, free/open graphics as your videoconferencing background (most of these are the creation of the brilliant Hugh D'Andrade).

&lt;h1&gt;The ideology of economics (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/26/badger-masks/#piketty"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the 21st Century" advanced a simple, data-supported hypothesis: that markets left to their own will cause capital to grow faster than the economy as a whole, so over time, the rich always get richer.

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2014/06/24/thomas-pikettys-capital-in-t.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2014/06/24/thomas-pikettys-capital-in-t.html&lt;/a&gt;

He's followed up Capital with the 1000-page "Capital and Ideology" - whose thesis is that the "laws" of economics are actually policies, created to "justify a society's inequalities," providing a rationale to convince poor people not to start building guillotines.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/ET-f88VUYAAg5hD.jpg"&gt;

The first ideology of capital was the "trifunctional" system of monarchist France, dividing society into "those who pray," "those who fight," and "those who work."

After the French revolution, we enter the capitalist phase, then social democracies, and now, "meritocracies."

"Meritocracies" invest markets with the mystical power to identify and elevate the worthy, in a kind of tautology: those who have the most are worth the most. You can tell they're worth the most because they have the most.

("That makes me smart" -D. Trump)

In Piketty's conception, "Inequality is neither economic nor technological. It's ideological and political," where "ideology" "refers to a set of a priori plausible ideas describing how society should be structured" (think: Overton Window).

&lt;a href="https://bostonreview.net/class-inequality/marshall-steinbaum-thomas-piketty-takes-ideology-inequality"&gt;https://bostonreview.net/class-inequality/marshall-steinbaum-thomas-piketty-takes-ideology-inequality&lt;/a&gt;

The major part of the book seeks to explain how the post-war social democracies gave way to the grifter meritocracies of today, pulling together threads from across the whole world to tell the tale.

On the way, he described alternatives that were obliterated, and others that were never tried, and shows how "meritocracy" gave us Trump, xenophobia, Brexit, and the Current Situation.

In particular, he's interested in why working class people stopped voting (spoiler: they no longer perceive that elites will pay attention to them irrespective of how they vote) -- and what it would take to mobilize them again.

The elites' indifference to working people is grounded in an alliance between the Brahmin Left (educated, well-paid liberals) and the Merchant Right (the finance sector). Notionally leftist parties, like the Democrats, are dominated by the Brahmin Left.

But more than any other, Macron epitomizes this alliance: proclaiming his liberal values while slashing taxes on the wealthy -- punishing poor people for driving cars, exempting private jets from his "climate" bill.

Life in a "meritocracy" is especially cruel for poor people, because meritocracies, uniquely among ideologies, blame poor people for poverty. It's right there in the name. French kings didn't think God was punishing peons, rather, that the Lord had put them there to serve.

"The broadly social-democratic redistributive coalitions of the mid-twentieth century were not just electoral or  institutional or party coalitions but also intellectual and ideological. The battle was fought and won above all on the battleground of ideas.”

As Marshall Steinbaum writes in his excellent review, Piketty's work doesn't just highlight new ideas in economics: it highlights the intellectual poverty of the economics profession and its tunnel vision.

"Economists cannot be allowed to be the arbiters of the intensely political concerns Piketty takes up in the book, and the good news is that there is reason to believe they won’t be."

Honored and pleased to have my book Little Brother included on the Library of Congress's excellent collection of open-access ebooks in its collection, which you can always access gratis but which may be of especial interest during the lockdown.

&lt;h1&gt;Canada nationalizes covid patents (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/26/badger-masks/#c13"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Canada's Parliament has passed Bill C13, "An Act respecting certain measures in response to COVID-19," amending patent law to create automatic compulsory licenses for any inventionused to fight covid, including diagnostics, vaccines, therapies or PPE.

&lt;a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/bill/C-13/third-reading"&gt;https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/bill/C-13/third-reading&lt;/a&gt;

As E Richard Gold writes, it's an "important signal that Canada will not support IP delays...While most firms are helping find solutions, this will prevent those who try to take advantage-by raising prices or limiting supply-or those who cannot deliver to block what is needed."

&lt;h1&gt;Exponential Threat (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/26/badger-masks/#exponential-threat"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

"Exponential Threat" is a remarkable - and factual - political ad, one that contrasts Trump's statements on coronavirus with the spread of the disease in America.

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkMwvmJLnc0"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkMwvmJLnc0&lt;/a&gt;

More remarkable: Trump has threatened to sue the media for airing it, which is a totally cool and normal thing for someone who has sworn a solemn oath to uphold the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to do.

Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sanders on GOP stimulus cruelty (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/26/badger-masks/#unlimited-cruelty"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

This Bernie Sanders floor speech in the Senate on the GOP's relentless attempts to punish poor people in the covid relief package is a must-watch

&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/fp3my0/bernie_goes_full_sanders_on_the_republicans_for/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/fp3my0/bernie_goes_full_sanders_on_the_republicans_for/&lt;/a&gt;

tldr: GOP Senators are freaking out because some people in line to get the pittances they're doling out actually earn EVEN LESS than $1k-2k/month, and so they might get a raise in the form of covid relief.

That is, rather than taking the fact that this bare-minimum subsidy package exceeds "normal" income as a wakeup call to raise the minimum wage for the first time since 2009, the GOP is calling for cuts to aid to the most vulnerable Americans.

As Sanders points out, these same Senators had no problem with the Tax Scam, which poured &lt;em&gt;trillions&lt;/em&gt; into the accounts of the richest Americans, directly and indirectly through stock-buybacks, which also left US business vulnerable and in need of trillions more today.

Now those bailed-out plutes want workers to risk death to "restart the economy," and the GOP will ensure they'll starve if they don't.

As ever, The Onion nails it:

&lt;a href="https://politics.theonion.com/gop-urges-end-of-quarantine-for-lifeless-bipedal-automa-1842461351"&gt;https://politics.theonion.com/gop-urges-end-of-quarantine-for-lifeless-bipedal-automa-1842461351&lt;/a&gt;

"GOP Urges End Of Quarantine For Lifeless Bipedal Automatons That Make Economy Go"

&lt;h1&gt;Record wind-power growth (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/26/badger-masks/#blows-blows"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

As the world's wind-generation capacity increases, you'd expect annual growth to fall proportionately (it's easier to double a very small number than a very big one!), but this year should see the largest proportional growth ever, a 20% increase!

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/worlds-wind-power-capacity-up-by-fifth-after-record-year"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/worlds-wind-power-capacity-up-by-fifth-after-record-year&lt;/a&gt;

That number is uncertain (hello, coronavirus), but on the other hand, there's a massive stimulus package in the offing that could be used to restart the economy by saving the planet with renewable energy.

The non-adjusted, pre-virus projection for this year's total growth in wind power was an additional 76GW (to meet climate projections, that number has to rise to 100GW/year, and then to 200GW/year).

&lt;h1&gt;Social distancing and other diseases (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/26/badger-masks/#flu-too"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Though the evidence is a little shaky, it appears that social distancing has dramatically reduced the spread of other infectious diseases, like flu.

&lt;a href="https://qz.com/1824020/social-distancing-slowing-not-only-covid-19-but-other-diseases-too/"&gt;https://qz.com/1824020/social-distancing-slowing-not-only-covid-19-but-other-diseases-too/&lt;/a&gt;

The data comes from an Internet of Shit "connected thermometer" company that (allegedly) anonymizes its data and uses it for health surveillance; they report a massive drop-off in high temps relative to other years and pre-distancing levels.

The claims are plausible, but they're also an ad for an IoT company that sells a product no one needs, so take them with a grain of salt.

&lt;h1&gt;Badger Masks (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/26/badger-masks/#badger-masks"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

A local hospital asked researchers at the UW Madison Engineering Design Innovation Lab to design them a field-expedient face-shield that could be mass-manufactured to protect its staff from coming cases.

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tinkerers-created-face-shield-being-used-hospitals/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/tinkerers-created-face-shield-being-used-hospitals/&lt;/a&gt;

Using hardware-store parts, the UW makerspace, and teleconferencing with self-isolating collaborators, the team designed an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; mask, the Badger Shield:

&lt;a href="https://making.engr.wisc.edu/shield/"&gt;https://making.engr.wisc.edu/shield/&lt;/a&gt;

They've manufactured and delivered 1,000 Badger Masks to the hospital and a Ford plant in MI is making 75,000 more this week for Detroit-area hospitals. Here's a technical spec you can follow if you have access to equipment and parts:

&lt;a href="https://www.delve.com/assets/documents/OPEN-SOURCE-FACE-SHIELD-DRAWING-v1.PDF"&gt;https://www.delve.com/assets/documents/OPEN-SOURCE-FACE-SHIELD-DRAWING-v1.PDF&lt;/a&gt;

It involves just 3 pieces: polyethylene sheets (laser- or die-cut), an elastic headband, and a 1" thick strip of self-adhesive polyurethane foam. For initial production, Midwest Prototyping used office-supply-store electric staplers for assembly.

The design process started with a teardown of an existing, approved mask, and the project lead, Lennon Rodgers, worked with collaborators to replicate it, sanity-checking successive designs with his wife, an anaesthesiologist.

They started hand-delivering prototypes to the hospital, who refined the design further, swapping in latex-free elastic and lengthening the shield. Tim Osswald from UW used his polymer engineering expertise to find a supplier who could create a custom die.

Now, more than 1M Badger Masks have been sought, with manufacturers like St Paul's Summit Medical tooling up to meet demand.

Other designs are popping up across America. San Francisco's Exploratorium is making 200+ shields/day using its own makerspace.

Currently reading: Just started Lauren Beukes's forthcoming Afterland: it's Y the Last Man plus plus, and two chapters in, it's amazeballs. Last month, I finished Andrea Bernstein's "American Oligarchs"; it's a magnificent history of the Kushner and Trump families, showing how they cheated, stole and lied their way into power. I'm getting really into Anna Weiner's memoir about tech, "Uncanny Valley." I just loaded Matt Stoller's "Goliath" onto my underwater MP3 player and I'm listening to it as I swim laps.

&lt;h1&gt;The US is now the epicenter of the pandemic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/27/just-asking-questions/#suicide-cults"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The US is now the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic, henceforth known as the Mar-a-Lago Virus. It has the highest number of infections of any country in the world.

&lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"&gt;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html&lt;/a&gt;

There have "only" been 1,000 US deaths so far. The "only" is there because there are so many more to come, when the vast number of incubating cases start manifesting symptoms and begin to die.

Trump wants the country to go back to work by Easter, because in his version of the Trolley Problem, the most important thing is saving the trolley.

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193670/trump-easter-coronavirus-isolation-relax-rules-economy-social-distancing"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193670/trump-easter-coronavirus-isolation-relax-rules-economy-social-distancing&lt;/a&gt;

We had so much warning. But the president said it wasn't anything to worry about.

Now, a lot of people are going to die.

Most of the dead will be old - from the demographic most likely to  have voted for Trump (which isn't to imply that only Trump voters will die, or that they deserve to die - only that Trump chose to put his base at risk).

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#turkey-shoot"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#turkey-shoot&lt;/a&gt;

Many will have contracted their infections by deliberately seeking out crowded public places as the pandemic started spreading, because Fox News told them that doing so was a way to own the libs.

Fox News viewers - who skew elderly, even by the standards of TV watchers -  are also disproportionately at risk from coronavirus. Fox News is now a suicide cult.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/19/gb-whatsapp/#fox-cult"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/19/gb-whatsapp/#fox-cult&lt;/a&gt;

But so many people will die because of this. Old people. Young people. People with disabilities. People who just had very bad luck. Kids.

And that's before you get to all the people who have car wrecks or heart attacks or slip-and-falls and can't get treatment in overloaded hospitals.

When Hoover fucked up by giving in to plutes and crashed the economy, he got tent cities, or "Hoovervilles."

Trump's fuckup will end with mass graves. Trump Mausoleums? Mar-a-Plague-Pits?

We will get through this. But Trump will have murdered so many of us before it's over.

&lt;h1&gt;Plutes cash in on stimulus (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/27/just-asking-questions/#stimulus-scam"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The stimulus package that the GOP Senate passed has the largest-ever giveaway for real-estate plutes in US tax history: $170 billion in tax-cuts over 10 years for couples with more than $500K in annual capital gains.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/coronavirus-real-estate-investors-stimulus.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/coronavirus-real-estate-investors-stimulus.html&lt;/a&gt;

The President who will sign the bill into law is a real-estate investor who stands to make a fortune from it. His inner circle is packed with similarly situated rentiers.

It's the second-biggest giveaway in the stimulus package, and it will also give windfalls to wealthy oil and gas investors.

The House is expected to vote on it today.

&lt;h1&gt;States prep for postal voting (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/27/just-asking-questions/#save-usps"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

States are scrambling to prepare for a postal ballot-based election next November.

&lt;a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/03/23/states-begin-prep-for-mail-in-voting-in-presidential-election"&gt;https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/03/23/states-begin-prep-for-mail-in-voting-in-presidential-election&lt;/a&gt;

Postal ballots tend to benefit Democrats, whose voters are disproportionately unable to get off work to vote, and who are more likely to live in regions where GOP statehouses have closed polling places, adding long drives and long queues for in-person voting.

That's why Red States often have state laws that prohibit unrestricted postal voting, insisting that voters must provide a "good reason" for their desire to exercise their franchise to a bureaucrat who gets to decide whether or not they can participate in elections.

Of course, if Trump throws hundreds of thousands - or millions - of (disproportionately GOP-voting) seniors into the coronavirus volcano to appease the market-gods, the survivors may be gunshy about voting in person, even if they continue as fully paid-up Trump cultists.

There are serious challenges to reorienting towards a largely postal election, including mobilizing printing resources during a lockdown.

But even more challenging is the post office itself, which is on the verge of collapse.

&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/coronavirus-postal-service-june-145683"&gt;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/coronavirus-postal-service-june-145683&lt;/a&gt;

The USPS is a miracle of self-funding resilience, a universal, small-d democratic institution that serves the whole nation. But its existence is a thorn in the side of shareholders UPS and Fedex, who donate lavishly to Congressjerks who fuck with the post office.

Requiring the post office to fund pension liabilities for workers who aren't born yet is transparent fuckery. Combine that with a sharp decline in mail usage during the lockdown and the service is now on the brink.

That would be bad news, and not just for elections. The USPS is key to America's emergency preparedness, and has been since the Cold War, when it was projected to serve as a survivor-counting/corpse-hauling service after nuclear armageddon.

It's the only institution that could deliver covid meds to every household in America in a single day.

&lt;h1&gt;"Civility" and the Confederate playbook (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/27/just-asking-questions/#just-asking-questions"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

You may have heard conservatives insist that the reason they stick up for eugenicists and other cryptofascists is that they're standing up for "civility" against the "social justice mobs."

This rhetoric isn't new: it's literally the same thing that slavery apologists said in the runup to, and aftermath of, the Civil War: "we're not in favor of slavery, we're just opposed to the shaming and social exclusion of slavery advocates.

&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/29/conservatives-say-weve-abandoned-reason-civility-old-south-said-that-too/"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/29/conservatives-say-weve-abandoned-reason-civility-old-south-said-that-too/&lt;/a&gt;

When we learn about the antebellum slavery debate, we hear about slavery's defenders - but the mainstream debate over slavery wasn't about its merits, it was about the incivility of abolitionists, and how that compromised the free speech of enslavers.

Slavery advocates were cast as a disfavored minority, shouted down by mobs who refused to hear them out. But discrimination against slavers was a funny kind of discrimination: half the millionaires in America were slavers in a single southern town.

Likewise, the right-wing figures who today claim that they are censored and cast out by the intolerant left are millionaires who fill arenas and appear regularly on Fox News, the most popular cable network in America.

They publish books with Big Five publishers and go on multicity tours. They're courted by "progressive" news outlets as paid on-air commentators to provide "balance." If that's discrimination, sign me up.

John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, professed love of Black people, and claimed he was animated by anger at the suppression of honest debate on racial politics, unable to share "my thoughts or sentiments" about slavery in polite society.

Slavers cast anti-slavery rhetoric as "orthodoxy" and cast themselves as realists who were willing to speak truth to power.

Does that sound familiar?

The abolition movement - including Lincoln - focused on these slavery apologists, understanding that they provided the cover for the continuation of slavery.

Lincoln insisted that Douglas go beyond lamenting the angry rhetoric of abolitionists and instead describe what he stood for - beyond his support of slavers' right to "choose how they wanted to live."

He demanded that Douglas go beyond his campaign speeches against "mob rule" and state plainly whether he wanted an America with or without slavery.

In her Washington Post op-ed, Eve Fairbanks suggests that we do the same for the "reasonable right" - pin them down. Sure, you don't like "cancel culture," but what do you stand for? What kind of world do you want?

&lt;h1&gt;Boris Johnson has coronavirus (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/27/just-asking-questions/#bojo"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has coronavirus.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/borisjohnson/status/1243496858095411200"&gt;https://twitter.com/borisjohnson/status/1243496858095411200&lt;/a&gt;

Under Johnson's leadership, the UK pursued a month-long plan to turn the nation into a giant pox-party, hoping to attain quick "herd immunity."

He was following a promising strategy devised for less-lethal, less-contagious flus, which was manifestly unsuited to coronavirus, as experts argued at the time. As a result, infections now rage out of control in the UK.

&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fnl0n6/im_a_critical_care_doctor_working_in_a_uk_high/#fla1iq6"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fnl0n6/im_a_critical_care_doctor_working_in_a_uk_high/#fla1iq6&lt;/a&gt;

During the planning of this "herd immunity" strategy, Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings acknowledged that it would likely murder elderly people: "if that means some pensioners die, too bad."

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#death-panels"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#death-panels&lt;/a&gt;

After Johnson tested positive for coronavirus, Cummings was seen fleeing Number 10 Downing Street at a dead run.

&lt;h1&gt;Reasonable covid food-safety advice (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/27/just-asking-questions/#germophobes"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

There's a viral (ugh) video going around in which an MD in scrubs (at home!) shows you what you should do when you come back from the grocery store. It's frankly terrifying. It's also wrong.

As Don Schaffner, a food microbiologist, notes in his thread, not only is this advice wrong, it could make you very sick -- either because you ate the soap that you washed your food in, or because you left your groceries on your stoop for 3 days.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bugcounter/status/1243319180851580929"&gt;https://twitter.com/bugcounter/status/1243319180851580929&lt;/a&gt;

There's no evidence that washing your food with soap will kill coronavirus, and even less evidence that you can get the virus from eating. There is, however, millennias' worth of evidence that you can die from food poisoning.

Schaffner's advice for groceries boils down to: wash your hands before and after grocery shopping. Wipe down the cart handle. Shop efficiently. Keep your distance from other shoppers.

You know, common sense.

The Warren campaign had a large cohort of software developers and created a suite of outstanding tools, as well as making improvements to standard tools, including improvements to the texting tool Spoke that reduces the cost of using it by ~97%!

Currently reading: Just started Lauren Beukes's forthcoming Afterland: it's Y the Last Man plus plus, and two chapters in, it's amazeballs. Last month, I finished Andrea Bernstein's "American Oligarchs"; it's a magnificent history of the Kushner and Trump families, showing how they cheated, stole and lied their way into power. I'm getting really into Anna Weiner's memoir about tech, "Uncanny Valley." I just loaded Matt Stoller's "Goliath" onto my underwater MP3 player and I'm listening to it as I swim laps.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/medtronic-covidien-large-noshake-3x2.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Lax antitrust killed ventilator stockpiles (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#market-oxygen"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

40 years ago, a fabulist named Robert Bork dreamed up an imaginary history of US antitrust law in order to justify dismantling it.

This Nixon co-conspirator - beloved of Ronald Reagan - cooked up a doctrine that said that monopolies are only a problem when they raise prices in the short/medium term.

Plutes &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; this idea, and 40 years later, mergers, acquisitions, vertical monopolies and other anticompetitive activities are the norm, and most major industries are dominated by as few as one, and rarely more than five firms.

The problem is that monopolies aren't just bad because they raise prices, they're bad &lt;em&gt;because they are monopolies&lt;/em&gt;. Monopolization allows firms to attack workers, suppliers and customers, and to extract monopoly rents that can be diverted to corrupt our political process.

Which is why we don't have any ventilators.

13 years ago, the US Dept of HHS awarded a contract to design low-cost, reliable ventilators to Newport Medical Instrument of Costa Mesa, CA. The ventilators would cost &amp;lt;$3k, allowing the US to procure a shit-ton of them against future pandemics.

This was a problem for existing med-tech giants, who charged &amp;gt;$10K for competing ventilators, but under Robert Bork's antitrust theory, there was a simple solution.

In 2012, Covidien, a giant in the field, simply plunked down $100m (chump change, given its revenues of $12b that year) and bought Newport.

Then they killed the ventilator project.

I mean, not right away. First they delayed it and demanded an additional $1.4M from the US government. Then they killed it.

Covidien is now a division of Medtronic (because Bork). Medtronic is a ghastly shitshow of a company.

They're a lead villain in the fight to kill off open artificial pancreases, which free people with diabetes from being turned into ambulatory inkjet printers, dependent on manufacturers for overpriced consumables to keep their fucking organs working.

&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/04/looping-created-insulin-pump-underground-market/588091/"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/04/looping-created-insulin-pump-underground-market/588091/&lt;/a&gt;

Their pacemakers and defibrillators can be wirelessly hacked to kill you where you stand.

&lt;a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/ICSMA-19-080-01" .https:="" www.us-cert.gov="" ics="" advisories="" icsma-19-080-01&lt;="" a=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/ICSMA-19-080-01" .https:="" www.us-cert.gov="" ics="" advisories="" icsma-19-080-01&lt;="" a=""&gt;Their stuff is so insecure, it can be hacked even before it leaves the factory.

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/ICSMA-19-080-01" .https:="" www.us-cert.gov="" ics="" advisories="" icsma-19-080-01&lt;="" a=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pacemaker-hack-malware-black-hat/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/pacemaker-hack-malware-black-hat/&lt;/a&gt;

Naturally, they're also part of the supervillain team that assembled to kill a wave of state Right to Repair bills.

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nz85y7/apple-is-lobbying-against-your-right-to-repair-iphones-new-york-state-records-confirm"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nz85y7/apple-is-lobbying-against-your-right-to-repair-iphones-new-york-state-records-confirm&lt;/a&gt;

(The lack of Right to Repair legislation is a big reason that hospitals are struggling to keep livesaving equipment online during the pandemic. Thanks, Medtronic!)

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/right-repair-times-pandemic"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/right-repair-times-pandemic&lt;/a&gt;

The dirty trick that killed off the US's attempt to procure a stockpile  of ventilators set the project back by years that, it turned out, we  didn't have. Philips now has a contract to deliver what Newport  couldn't. They haven't shipped.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a name="motivated-reasoning"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/covidCharles_Koch_Portrait.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Koch network demands an end to lockdown (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#motivated-reasoning"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The Charles Koch network is one of the most successful dark money/influence operations in the world, an example of how a single, ultra-wealthy individual can project his will over millions of people by funding dozens of front orgs.

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/26/americans-for-prosperity-cdc-coronavirus/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2020/03/26/americans-for-prosperity-cdc-coronavirus/&lt;/a&gt;

Koch orgs like Americans for Prosperity were critical to the weakening of the CDC, pushing for a $1B cut to the agency in 2018, characterizing it as emblematic of "the burden overspending is placing on all taxpayers."

&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6810490-AFP-2018-Budget-Cut-List.html"&gt;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6810490-AFP-2018-Budget-Cut-List.html&lt;/a&gt;

AFP also served as a funnel for money spent to block state Medicaid expansions, rollbacks of environmental regulations, and the $1.5T Trump tax cuts.

They sure do get shit done. Terrible, terrible shit.

Their new project? Re-opening businesses and ending covid lockdown and social distancing, asserting that firms will "adapt and innovate" to maintain safety without the need for government regulation.

In a way, I feel bad for them. It's gotta be tough to have reality's well-known left-wing bias tossed in your face with nothing but a slurry of high-grade petrodollars to soothe the wounds.

There clearly are libertarians in a pandemic. Very, very unhappy ones, experiencing scorching cognitive dissonance and engaged in heroic feats of motivated reasoning.

The kicker? AFP is on lockdown. It sent its workers home: "to ensure the health and safety of our activists, staff, and voters, our staff are working from home and are utilizing digital organizing as one way to continue their grassroots engagement."

Yeah, this is a sick burn, but also, totally normal. As Yochai Benkler points out in this lecture, even the most selfish, Rand-worshipping PE manager can be seen in playgrounds, shouting "Timmy, you share that toy!" at his toddler.

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMxz7rzwee8"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMxz7rzwee8&lt;/a&gt;

Sociopathy may be pareto-optimal, but no one wants to live with a child who has been raised to live in Galt Gulch, and it's hard to doom your office staff to die for want of a ventilator in good conscience.

It's not really any different from the Young Earth Creationist oil barons who direct their geoengineers to look for oil where it would be if the Earth was 4B years old, rather than 5K.

Just as every (surviving) Breatharian was found to be secretly sneaking out to 7-11 for Doritos at 2AM while claiming to survive on nothing but nutrients siphoned up through deep-breathing.

&lt;h1&gt;Private equity firms scooping up pandemic bargains (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#blackstone-kkr"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

This is the crisis that private equity has been waiting for. With $1.5T in cash reserves and crippled businesses, the pandemic is a dream come true for vulture capitalists like Carlyle, Blackstone and KKR.

They're chasing "PIPEs" (private investments in public equity - discount shares in public businesses) like crazy, looking for weak businesses to buy, debt-load, asset-strip and leave to die.

Shouldn't surprise anyone: opportunistic, parasitic infections are always a present when an animal is wounded.

But this is an election year, and the Democratic candidacy has not been determined. There's only one of the final two who calls for real limits on finance.

It'll be interesting to see which impulse wins out in the PE boardrooms: greedy desire to devour good companies and shit out useless husks, or self-preserving forbearance in the face of a looming plebiscite on our regulatory future.

&lt;h1&gt;Digital rights are human rights (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#fiber-now"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

I've been working on digital human rights for nearly 20 years now, and I remember how the idea was once widely mocked as a distraction.

Back in 2009, Finland was derided for declaring broadband a human right.

&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/10/15/finland.internet.rights/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/10/15/finland.internet.rights/index.html&lt;/a&gt;

And even by Malcolm Gladwell standards, this 2010 take on the uselessness of online activism has not aged well.

&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/small-change-malcolm-gladwell"&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/small-change-malcolm-gladwell&lt;/a&gt;

The GOP and Ajit Pai's attacks on the Lifeline fund to bring broadband to rural and disadvantaged Americans are modern versions of the infection that says that the digital divide is a frivolity.

But pandemics have a well-known left-wing bias, and as the world struggles to replace f2f with digital-only, the foolishness of allowing rapacious, lazy, financialized, incompetent telcos to maintain the nervous system of the 21st Century is increasingly obvious.

Hence calls like this one, to treat broadband as a public utility:

&lt;a href="https://qz.com/1826043/the-coronavirus-crisis-proves-internet-should-be-a-public-utility/"&gt;https://qz.com/1826043/the-coronavirus-crisis-proves-internet-should-be-a-public-utility/&lt;/a&gt;

As I've mentioned, my city, Burbank, has a 100GB publicly owned fiber network that runs right under my foundation slab, but residents can't access it, thanks to a franchise deal with Charter, a genuinely terrible company.

As it happens, I was discussing something else with one of my city councillors yesterday and this subject came up and he asked me to send him a briefing on the subject that he could circulate to other city officials. Here's what I wrote him:

It would be a dream come true for Burbank to make its fiber network available to residential customers. Our taxpayer-purchased 100GB loop is 300X+ faster than the fastest speeds offered by our broadband monopolist, Charter.

Municipal fiber networks are beloved wherever they are found.

The only Americans who love their ISPs are customers of city-owned/operated fiber:

&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/telecom-services/cord-cutting-continues-high-cable-pricing/"&gt;https://www.consumerreports.org/telecom-services/cord-cutting-continues-high-cable-pricing/&lt;/a&gt;

Municipal fiber is the fastest, cheapest broadband in America:

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xgne9/locally-run-isps-offer-the-fastest-broadband-in-america"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xgne9/locally-run-isps-offer-the-fastest-broadband-in-america&lt;/a&gt;

(It's 50% cheaper! &lt;a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2018/01/communityfiber"&gt;https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2018/01/communityfiber&lt;/a&gt;)

More than 750 cities in the US operate municipal broadband networks:

&lt;a href="https://muninetworks.org/communitymap"&gt;https://muninetworks.org/communitymap&lt;/a&gt;

Despite Trump admin warnings, it's totally untrue that municipal networks are liable to commit censorship (indeed, muni networks are constrained by the First Amendment in ways that private networks are not):

&lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bj49j8/fcc-falsely-claims-community-broadband-an-ominous-threat-to-the-first-amendment"&gt;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bj49j8/fcc-falsely-claims-community-broadband-an-ominous-threat-to-the-first-amendment&lt;/a&gt;

The poorest predominately white community in the US - in rural Appalachia - installed a fiber network (they used a mule named "Ole Bub" to reach their most isolated homesteads!) and underwent an economic miracle:

&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-one-traffic-light-town-with-some-of-the-fastest-internet-in-the-us"&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-one-traffic-light-town-with-some-of-the-fastest-internet-in-the-us&lt;/a&gt;

The best book on this is Susan Crawford's "Fiber: The Coming Tech Revolution―and Why America Might Miss It":

&lt;a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300228502/fiber"&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300228502/fiber&lt;/a&gt;

Instead of muni fiber, Burbankers are using Charter service, which is rated some of the worst in the USA. They're the company that is forcing back-office employees to come into work even if they can work from home:

&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/charter-coronavirus-work-home/"&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/charter-coronavirus-work-home/&lt;/a&gt;

and in lieu of hazard pay (or PPE, or hand sanitizer), the company is providing its field techs (who enter our homes and risk us and them!) with $25 gift certificates...to restaurants that are not open and may not survive the crisis (these are also a taxable benefit for those workers):

&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/spectrum-workers-coronavirus-gift-cards"&gt;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/spectrum-workers-coronavirus-gift-cards&lt;/a&gt;

(Charter got billions in the tax bill and blew it all on buybacks while dropping maintenance and capex to historic, industry-trailing lows).

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/800px-Aaron_swartz_6722391455.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ACLU vanquishes the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#aaronsw"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The ACLU has prevailed in a crucial lawsuit, where they argued that journalists and security researchers should be able to violate websites' terms of service without risking criminal liability under a Reagan-era anti-hacking law.

&lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-court-rules-big-data-discrimination-studies-do-not-violate-federal-anti"&gt;https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-court-rules-big-data-discrimination-studies-do-not-violate-federal-anti&lt;/a&gt;

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) was passed (literally) in a panic over the movie Wargames, delivering broad powers to US prosecutors to criminally charge anyone who "exceeds authorization" on a computer.

Over time, companies like Facebook (in its Power Ventures suit) converted this overly broad doctrine into a "Criminal Contempt of Business Model" statute, arguing that violating its terms of service constituted a CFAA breach.

They were assisted by prosecutors like Steven Heymann and Carmen Ortiz, who used CFAA to charge Aaron Swartz with 13 felonies and threaten him with 35 years in prison after he ignored JSTOR's terms of service and bulk downloaded articles he was allowed one-at-a-time access to.

In the years since, there have been multiple attempts to reform CFAA, but these have been repeatedly killed by Big Tech companies, notably Oracle, whose CSO has a history of threatening customers who audit its products before trusting them.

&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/oracle-security-chief-to-customers-stop-checking-our-code-for-vulnerabilities/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/oracle-security-chief-to-customers-stop-checking-our-code-for-vulnerabilities/&lt;/a&gt;

The result has been a deep chilling effect on researchers, from security researchers who tell us whether we can trust online products, to investigative journalists who test algorithms for bias, including bias that violates federal antidiscrimination statutes.

And this is where the ACLU has prevailed! In Sandvig v Barr, a federal judge in DC ruled that there is no criminal CFAA liability for terms-of-service violations, though he left the door open for civil liability.

But that civil liability is also being eroded: LinkedIn recently had their asses handed to them in a CFAA suit against a competitor, setting a precedent that dramatically narrows civil liability for ToS violations.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data&lt;/a&gt;

This is a really important moment for online freedom. It says that companies can't conjure up new jailable offenses merely by asserting that you have agreed that you are a criminal if you displease their shareholders.

There are still some really ghastly Contempt of Business Model laws hanging around out there, like Section 1201 of the DMCA, which makes it a felony to bypass a copyright "access control" even if you don't infringe copyright.

It's a rule that's used to felonize everything from refilling printer cartridges to accessing your own medical implant data, and (especially) getting your devices repaired by independent technicians.

At EFF, we have a longrunning lawsuit, on behalf of Bunnie Huang and Matthew Green, to overturn this law. It's slow going, but we took a huge step forward last spring.

Old PDP7 systems used Type 340 XY displays whose P7 phosphors had a slow decay process that MIT AI lab hackers used to create "Munching Squares" displays.

&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/V4oRHv-Svwc"&gt;https://youtu.be/V4oRHv-Svwc&lt;/a&gt;

These were pretty cool! But even cooler was the weird "Munching Tunes" that you could listen to if you placed a small AM receiver near the display and picked up the prodigious RFI it gave off.

&lt;img src="https://pluralistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/animation-1-1.gif"&gt;

Munching Squares has been an option in JWZ's Xscreensaver since 1997!

Currently writing: I'm getting geared up to start work my next novel, "The Lost Cause," a post-GND novel about truth and reconciliation.

Currently reading: Just started Lauren Beukes's forthcoming Afterland: it's Y the Last Man plus plus, and two chapters in, it's amazeballs. Last month, I finished Andrea Bernstein's "American Oligarchs"; it's a magnificent history of the Kushner and Trump families, showing how they cheated, stole and lied their way into power. I'm getting really into Anna Weiner's memoir about tech, "Uncanny Valley." I just loaded Matt Stoller's "Goliath" onto my underwater MP3 player and I'm listening to it as I swim laps.

&lt;h1&gt;Amazon's leaked anti-worker smear plan (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/03/socially-useless-parasite/#christian-smalls"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

What's stupider than firing the warehouse manager who organized an Amazon warehouse walkout over covid contamination?

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/31/reality-endorses-sanders/#instacart-wholefoods-amazon"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/31/reality-endorses-sanders/#instacart-wholefoods-amazon&lt;/a&gt;

Writing a memo explaining how you plan to smear that organizer to neutralize your own workers' demands for a safe work environment, assuming, incorrectly, that it won't leak.

(NARRATOR: IT LEAKED)

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate&lt;/a&gt;

Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky's leaked memo said that the fired warehouse worker, Christian Smalls was "not smart or articulate" and suggested that the company make him "the face of the entire union/organizing movement."

Zapolsky's memo set out the company's messaging, that Smalls's leadership of the walkout  was immoral, unacceptable, and arguably illegal, in detail, and  only then follow with our usual talking points about worker safety."

Zapolsky told Motherboard that he "was frustrated and upset that an Amazon employee would endanger the health and safety of other Amazonians" and he "was frustrated and upset that an Amazon employee would endanger the health and safety of other Amazonians."

In Smalls's interview with Jeremy Scahill on the Intercepted podcast, he describes how he decided to risk his livelihood in the midst of a pandemic to protect his coworkers, who were visibly sick with covid but not given paid leave.

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/01/essential-workers-and-the-reverse-robin-hood-coronavirus-bailout/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2020/04/01/essential-workers-and-the-reverse-robin-hood-coronavirus-bailout/&lt;/a&gt;

How all he wanted from the company was a deep clean of the warehouse - as they'd done in other contaminated facilities - and paid leave while their workplace was made safe. Having read Zapolsky's leaked candid remarks and heard Smalls make his case, I know who I believe.

&lt;h1&gt;Wikipedia vs patent troll (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/03/socially-useless-parasite/#worldlogic"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Worldlogic is a patent troll, who claim to own a patent over searchboxes that autocomplete your queries. They don't make tools, they make lawsuits...against people who make tools. When that patent was litigated, courts found it likely to be invalid.

&lt;a href="https://www.unifiedpatents.com/insights/2018/2/14/wordlogic-patent-determined-to-be-likely-invalid"&gt;https://www.unifiedpatents.com/insights/2018/2/14/wordlogic-patent-determined-to-be-likely-invalid&lt;/a&gt;

Alas (and predictably), Worldlogic settled that case before the court could annihilate their bullshit patent. That way, they got to use it to threaten other productive toolmakers to collect rent for socially useless parasites.

For example, they have threatened Wikipedia and the Internet Archive, who have asked a court to invalidate their patent,

&lt;a href="https://www.infodocket.com/2020/03/13/report-wikimedia-internet-archive-want-patent-infringement-claims-kicked-out/"&gt;https://www.infodocket.com/2020/03/13/report-wikimedia-internet-archive-want-patent-infringement-claims-kicked-out/&lt;/a&gt;

It's likely we'll see their arguments in July. For now, you can enjoy Wikipedia's lawyers' letter explaining in eyewatering detail that these trolls did not invent autocomplete.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/26935048383_e38ef30351_k.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bug bounty programs as catch-and-kills (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/03/socially-useless-parasite/#features-not-bugs"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

You entrust digital products with a lot: from your thermostat to your car's informatics to your pacemaker to your email and financial data, defects in computers can expose you to potentially enormous risk.

The only thing worse than using a defective product is &lt;em&gt;unknowingly&lt;/em&gt; using a defective product (having faulty brakes is bad, discovering your brakes are faulty on the highway is much, much worse).

Tech companies have long asserted that they alone have the right to decide who can disclose true facts about defects in their products...for safety. If randos who discover their mistakes make disclosures without warning companies, then "bad guys" will exploit the bugs.

There's a legitimate ethical debate about the best way to make bug disclosures, but even if you believe that someone should be the official, legal custodian of Bad News About a Company's Products, it's commonsense that the company itself should not be that custodian.

It seems obvious that, in the US, the First Amendment protects your right to make truthful disclosures about defective products. Yet, corporations (led by Oracle) have stretched the disastrously vague, Reagan-era Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to threaten (and, sometimes, imprison) researchers who make these disclosures without permission.

It's not just CFAA. Sec 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides 5 years prison/$500k fine for first offenses to anyone who "trafficks" in a "circumvention device". So publishing proof-of-concept code demonstrating vulns in systems with DRM is a potential felony.

Enter the Vulnerability Disclosure Program and its freespending cousin, the Bug Bounty Program. Under these "managed disclosure" systems, companies invite security researchers to reveal their findings.

In theory, this is how we want things to work: rather than coercing researchers into silence, companies entice them into cooperation, say, by promising to publish all reported bugs themselves after a suitable period to investigate and fix them.

Maybe they even pay researchers for going the managed disclosure route.

In practice, though, criminal and civil threats loom large over these programs. Companies offer cash and immunity to researchers as a carrot, but they hold out fines and prison as a stick.

And it turns out that, yup, companies are really shitty stewards of bad news about their own products. When companies get to set terms on which hackers talk to them first, they set terms that bind researchers to long periods (sometimes indefinite) of silence.

And the companies also reserve the right to decide whether &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; will ever reveal the bugs to us poor suckers trusting their products with our money, privacy and lives, whether they'll ever patch those products, etc.

But a few years back, some people had an idea to turn this bug into a feature: they'd start VC-backed companies that would manage bug bounties and disclosure programs for companies. They'd organize researchers, validate findings, manage thorny comms with the companies...

They'd build platforms where researchers could flock and socialize and collaborate and become millionaires (!) by working &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; companies, instead of against them.

That didn't work out so great. Because the hackers that the companies were supposed to protect weren't these companies' customers - the tech companies whose products they were testing were the customers.

So the companies whose worst impulses the bug-management platforms were supposed to be blunting ended up running the show, and the reporting platforms became a catch-and-kill system for vulns.

&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3535888/bug-bounty-platforms-buy-researcher-silence-violate-labor-laws-critics-say.html"&gt;https://www.csoonline.com/article/3535888/bug-bounty-platforms-buy-researcher-silence-violate-labor-laws-critics-say.html&lt;/a&gt;

Hackers who join these platforms to earn big by doing the right thing instead find that they are required to sign indefinite, one-sided NDAs that prevent them from disclosing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, even the fact that they signed an NDA.

And the companies don't have to make any promises (apart from payment...sometimes) to do anything about the bugs that are brought to them by researchers.

In JM Porup's excellent piece on this for CSO Magazine, he describes how the VC-backed, growth-oriented bug-bounty platforms are incentivized to, uh, overstate how much money hackers can make from using them, and what kind of results they can expect.

Reading between the lines, and talking with former Hackerone exec Katie Moussouris, Porup makes a pretty good case that apart from statistically insignificant outliers, there's not much money to be made by using these platforms, and the price of admission is silence and inaction.

Porup also makes the case that bug bounty platforms are potentially violating California's employment law, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the GDPR. He also debunks claims that their operations follow the ISO standards for bug disclosure (which Moussouris co-authored).

I think that the outcome here was entirely predictable. The bug bounty platforms have tacitly endorsed the idea that it is/should be illegal to tell the truth about defective products without permission from the products' manufacturers.

Inevitably, deputizing companies to decide who can warn their customers that their products can't be trusted ends with those companies abusing that power. Period. To imagine otherwise is to engage in fantasy. It's the kind of motivated reasoning that looks great in a VC pitch but is a disaster in the world.

&lt;h1&gt;The Tea Party killed pandemic preparedness (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/03/socially-useless-parasite/#you-were-warned"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In 2010, the CDC funded a report urging  the federal government to treat public health preparedness “on par with federal and state funding for other national security response capabilities." Specifically, they called for N95 mask stockpiling.

&lt;a href="https://www.astho.org/Programs/Infectious-Disease/H1N1/H1N1-Barriers-Project-Report-Final-hi-res/"&gt;https://www.astho.org/Programs/Infectious-Disease/H1N1/H1N1-Barriers-Project-Report-Final-hi-res/&lt;/a&gt;

The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate funds fro this purpose. The Tea Party-dominated Republicans killed those allocations, starving the program of $321m in the years since.

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/us-emergency-medical-stockpile-funding-unprepared-coronavirus#181900"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/us-emergency-medical-stockpile-funding-unprepared-coronavirus#181900&lt;/a&gt;

In 2011, the Tea Party Republicans in Congress killed another appropriation for public health preparedness, after the swine flu emergency demolished existing PPE stockpiles.

In 2011, after the debt-ceiling crisis, Senate and Congressional GOP officials again slashed funding for health emergencies. Tom Harkin, the Democratic chair of the Senate appropriations committee said at the time, "We’re now getting into the bone marrow."

The Obama administration repeatedly begged Tea Party Congressjerks to appropriate for public health emergencies, warning of the dire consequences of a pandemic.

&lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/02/22/weekly-address-congress-must-act-now-stop-sequester#transcript"&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/02/22/weekly-address-congress-must-act-now-stop-sequester#transcript&lt;/a&gt;

During the zika crisis, the Tea Party gave Obama half of what he said he needed for future health emergencies.

&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44460#page=12"&gt;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44460#page=12&lt;/a&gt;

In 2016, an urgent National Academies of Science Report affirmed the need for massive spending to improve public health preparedness.

&lt;a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/23532/chapter/1"&gt;https://www.nap.edu/read/23532/chapter/1&lt;/a&gt;

Since the 2016 elections, the Trump administration has repeatedly called for massive cuts to CDC funding.

When Propublica asked retired Tea Party Congressman Denny Rehberg (who chaired the appropriations subcommittee responsible for overseeing the stockpile in 2011) about this, he told them that this emergency was as unforseeable as 9/11.

This is the GOP line: no one could have foreseen this. It's Trump's line: he inherited this mess from Democrats. The reality is that the Tea Party was told, and told, and told again. And they did less than nothing: not merely failing to act but actually making things worse.

&lt;h1&gt;Neighbors treated to socially isolated buildingside screening (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/09/all-hail-morlocks/#movie-night"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Scott Duggan is the tech manager of the Cyclone Rep theater in Cork. He's on lockdown, along with his neighbours on his terrace. So he set up a screening of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes on the gable-end house, with audio transmitted over low-power FM

&lt;a href="https://www.pressreader.com/ireland/irish-examiner/20200408/28153511310636"&gt;https://www.pressreader.com/ireland/irish-examiner/20200408/28153511310636&lt;/a&gt;

He used the cinema's projector and solicited donations for Age Action. The neighbourhood all watched from socially distant locations -- patios, gardens, etc.

&lt;h1&gt;Philips quadruples ventilator costs (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/09/all-hail-morlocks/#covidiens-revenge"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

13 years ago, HHS signed a contract with Newport Medical Instruments to produce low-cost ventilators against a future pandemic. Covidien (now Medtronic) bought Newport and killed the project. They make a ventilator that costs 333% more than Newport's.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#market-oxygen"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#market-oxygen&lt;/a&gt;

Years later, HHS offered the same deal to Philips, who failed to produce a single respirator in time for the coronavirus pandemic, despite absorbing millions in federal spending for the project.

Now, Philips has done a deal to sell the US government ventilators at &lt;em&gt;four times&lt;/em&gt; the price that they were contracted for -- more than $15,000 each (Covidien's overpriced ventilators only cost $10k each).

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-company-promised-cheap-ventilators-to-the-government-never-delivered-and-is-now-charging-quadruple-the-price-for-the-new-ones#182584"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/a-company-promised-cheap-ventilators-to-the-government-never-delivered-and-is-now-charging-quadruple-the-price-for-the-new-ones#182584&lt;/a&gt;

Philips stands to make $646.7m on the deal, through which they will provide 2,500 Trilogy EV300 ventilators rather than the 10,000 $3,280 ventilators they'd agreed to provide for HHS's national stockpile. Philips was already paid $13.8m to develop the low-cost ventilators.

&lt;h1&gt;Kansas GOP nukes ban on large Easter gatherings (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/09/all-hail-morlocks/#gop-death-cult"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Kansas's Democratic Gov Laura Kelly issued an executive order limiting Easter and Passover gatherings to ten people. The GOP legislature overturned it.

&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/491887-kansas-legislature-strikes-down-governors-directive-limiting-size-of"&gt;https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/491887-kansas-legislature-strikes-down-governors-directive-limiting-size-of&lt;/a&gt;

It's another reminder that the right's claim that it is the party of rational long-termism rather than squishy bleeding-heart reflex is just bullshit.

Koch has the foresight to buy coal tech with 20-year amortization, but not to spare the lives of the GOP's voting base.

There's literally nothing more politically short-term than dooming your core voters to die gasping deaths in a month because you're afraid they'll be angry at you on Easter Sunday. Angry voters might not vote for you. Dead voters can't.

The Saudis have banned the Hajj, the Pope has cancelled Easter services, but we're still seeing mass gatherings, primarily among evangelicals -- a reliable source of turkey-votes for Christmas, and the key to GOP political dominance.

&lt;h1&gt;Kickpunch's Disney comics/horror movie mashups (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/09/all-hail-morlocks/#wolt-fistey"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Daniel "Kickpunch" Björk created an incredible set of Disney Comic/horror movie mashups.

&lt;a href="https://www.kickpunch.se/"&gt;https://www.kickpunch.se/&lt;/a&gt;

There are 18 in the series (so far) and you can get 'em as tees or art prints. Be sure to check out his whole portfolio -- he's a font of parodical, grotesque and wonderful pop-culture remix illustrations.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/800px-Bales_of_PET_bottles_closeup.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Plastic-eating enzyme (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/09/all-hail-morlocks/#pet"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Researchers at Carbios and the the University of Toulouse have created a "mutant" variant of leaf-branch compost cutinase that can break the bonds in PET plastics.

&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/huge-step-forward-mutant-enzyme-could-vastly-improve-recycling-plastic-bottles"&gt;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/huge-step-forward-mutant-enzyme-could-vastly-improve-recycling-plastic-bottles&lt;/a&gt;

The new enzyme is 10,000x more efficient at breaking up PET, and remains intact at temperatures above 72' C, which is PET's softening point (softer plastics are easier to break down, but enzymes also break down at higher temps).

&lt;a href="https://sci-hub.tw/downloads-ii/2020-04-09/c8/10.1038@s41586-020-2149-4.pdf"&gt;https://sci-hub.tw/downloads-ii/2020-04-09/c8/10.1038@s41586-020-2149-4.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

The breakdown is so efficient that it produces recylced plastic that is as strong as virgin plastic, and the enzyme naturally separates out pigments used to make color plastics so the end-product is clear.

"Carbios is building a demonstration plant that is expected to recycle hundreds of tons of PET per year." The process is more expensive than making new plastics, but because we allow plastics manufacturers to impose the external costs of their process on society.

&lt;h1&gt;Cold brew coffee chemistry (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/09/all-hail-morlocks/#niny-rao"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Niny Rao and colleagues from Thomas Jefferson University have been studying the chemical composition of cold brew coffee, a subject very near and dear to my heart. They just posted a "virtual poster session" at the American Chemical Society's site.

&lt;a href="https://www.morressier.com/article/role-roast-chemical-characteristics-cold-brew-coffee/5e736c70cde2b641284abdff?"&gt;https://www.morressier.com/article/role-roast-chemical-characteristics-cold-brew-coffee/5e736c70cde2b641284abdff?&lt;/a&gt;

They tested roasts of varying darkness, and found that with darker roasts, there were significant differences in the solids extracted with and without heat.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/U_OuzoR9.jpeg"&gt;

They conclude that cold brew improves when brewed at room temp (not in the fridge).

&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/the-chemistry-of-cold-brew-coffee-is-so-hot-right-now/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/the-chemistry-of-cold-brew-coffee-is-so-hot-right-now/&lt;/a&gt;

They also advise multiple rounds of filtering (through multiple layers of filter) to remove unwanted solids and halt the extraction process, and a ten hour (e.g. overnight) extraction.

I'm going to try it. I've tinkered with lots of ways of making cold brew, including some expensive (and beautiful - love my Kyoto dripper) apparatus, but ultimately went back to the easy, low-mess "grinds in a mesh bag, bag in a water jug, wait, squeeze, discard" method.

&lt;h1&gt;Tails adds Secureboot support (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/09/all-hail-morlocks/#uefi"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Secureboot foils malware that targets firmware by checking BIOS before it loads, using a secure coprocessor on the motherboard to verify cryptographic signatures to detect tampering.

&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tails-the-security-focused-os-adds-support-for-secure-boot/"&gt;https://www.zdnet.com/article/tails-the-security-focused-os-adds-support-for-secure-boot/&lt;/a&gt;

The Tails project - makers of the fantastically secure bootable OS-on-a-stick - have added Secureboot support in their latest version, after a six year development cycle.

&lt;a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_4.5/index.en.html"&gt;https://tails.boum.org/news/version_4.5/index.en.html&lt;/a&gt;

This means that Tails users no longer have to disable UEFI Secureboot, making using Tails both easier and more secure!

&lt;h1&gt;Crisis makes heroes of IT workers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/09/all-hail-morlocks/#morlocks"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

IT workers are typically undervalued and heaped with abuse in a Morlocks-vs-Eloi dynamic that has been shattered by the pandemic, which has made IT (even more) utterly central to firms.

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/are-you-finally-thankful-for-your-it-person-now"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/are-you-finally-thankful-for-your-it-person-now&lt;/a&gt;

The IT trap of wanting to control your users and wanting to empower them is on full display, as IT departments pull all-nighters and multi-day marathons to set their coworkers up for remote work and provision their systems to handle the new workflows.

Now they're station-keeping, supporting users far from the office, and expressing weary IT laments: "Kelly’s team was flooded by calls from employees who’d  forgotten their computer password and guessed wrong too many times."

"He's also hoping people learn to use the “reply-all” button on group emails more sparingly."

It's not quite When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth, but it's getting there.

The modern era has many tiny hypocrisies, but none quite so common as the mutual pretense by which you ask me to print, sign and scan a PDF and I pretend that I didn't just paste my signatures into it.

But some firms shatter this tacit social contract and demand that you really engage in the ridiculous ritual of actually printing, signing and scanning.

Enter Falsiscan, a tool to automate convincing forgeries of this procedure.

&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/edouardklein/falsisign"&gt;https://gitlab.com/edouardklein/falsisign&lt;/a&gt;

Falsiscan takes in 27 variants of your signature and then feed these sigs and your PDF to it, with the (x,y) for each signature blank as arguments, and it will produce a slightly off-center, slightly degraded new PDF that looks like you actually signed it.

&lt;a name="filternet"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/covid-home-ip.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Web-wide copyright filters would be a disaster (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/22/filternet/#filternet"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

I have enormous sympathy for artists suffering financial anxiety during the pandemic. I have 3 books out in 2020 and my family was really counting on them selling well to pay our bills, so I really, really get it.

The anxiety is real and justified, but music-industry calls to force US online services to filter everything we post with automated copyright filters are not. They are a terrible, awful idea.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/copyright-and-crisis-filters-are-not-answer"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/copyright-and-crisis-filters-are-not-answer&lt;/a&gt;

Anyone who's ever dealt with existing copyright filters - like Youtube's Content ID - knows that they are (and this is being charitable), a giant fucking flaming shit-show that everyone hates with the heat of a thousand suns.

Not only do these filters fail to police copyright adequately (source: the exact same people calling for MOAR FILTERZ), they also flag and block entire libraries' worth of legit material.

It's hard to overstate just how bad the overblocking is. Youtube blocked a panel where copyright experts discussed how its blocking system worked. That video was only unblocked because one of the experts knew a top lawyer at Youtube and made a call.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/takedowns/automated-copyright-filter-cant-detect-infringement-or-irony"&gt;https://www.eff.org/takedowns/automated-copyright-filter-cant-detect-infringement-or-irony&lt;/a&gt;

Also blocked: classical musicans' own performances of centuries-old Bach compositions. Birdsong. Silence. Static. Videos of adorable toddlers dancing in their parents' kitchens.

And - this should surprise no one - when you create a system that allows scumbags to fraudulently claim copyright to other peoples' work, with no effective system to reverse those claims, scumbags do exactly that.

Sometimes it's to steal artists' money. Sometimes its to censor their work. Sometimes it's to blackmail artists (three "copystrikes" and Youtube nukes your account from orbit, with no recourse for you).

Filters aren't just bad at stopping infringement, nor merely bad at permitting lawful material to pass, nor simply an invitation to fraud and censorship.

They're also really, really expensive.

Content ID (the aforementioned flaming shit-show) cost &lt;em&gt;$100 million. So far.&lt;/em&gt;

You know how many online companies have an extra hundred mil kicking around during the crisis? About five of 'em. The exact same Big Tech companies that are ripping the rest of us off.

Big Tech is happy to cough up a mere $100m or so to annihilate every possible competitor. $100m isn't chump change, but it represents a &lt;em&gt;stellar bargain&lt;/em&gt; as a fee for a Perpetual Internet Domination License.

And if you think Youtube and FB are hard to get a decent deal out of in a world where they have to worry about smaller competitors getting bigger, just imagine what they'll be like once they've carved up the internet forever.

I want a diverse, pluralistic internet, not five giant websites filled with screenshots from the other four.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040"&gt;https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040&lt;/a&gt;

Not just because  that's a better internet, but because it's a better internet for artists.

The internet is already terrible enough, and it's all we've got to see us through this crisis.

Subjecting every word, image, video and sound we upload to automated black-box filters operated by high-handed faceless corps that can't be bothered to answer their email?

That'll make it a billion times worse.

For everyone.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Curbed_Spot_4_14.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Apartment buildings didn't cause the pandemic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/22/filternet/#kate-wagner"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

You could be forgiven for thinking that Kate "McMansion Hell" is all about dunking on McMansions (for obvious reasons), but Wagner is a multiple threat. Here she is explaining why coronavirus doesn't prove that apartment buildings are bad.

&lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/4/22/21224935/coronavirus-density-debate-mcmansion-hell-kate-wagner"&gt;https://www.curbed.com/2020/4/22/21224935/coronavirus-density-debate-mcmansion-hell-kate-wagner&lt;/a&gt;

The pandemic has brought out a slew of idiotic criticisms on the lines of "See, this proves that every city should be a sprawling, low-density car-commuter paradise and everyone should have a standalone house with a tiny private park to exercise in."

As Wagner points out, this NIMBY opportunism is incredibly bad faith: Apartment buildings are inanimate objects. They didn't cause the shortage of medical supplies. They didn't make Donald Trump procure bum tests. They didn't prompt weeks of catastrophic denial and inaction.

It's true that badly maintained apartment buildings - lacking regular cleaning and maintenance - represent a public health crisis accellerant. But to blame the structure - and not the slumlord who chose to skimp on maintenance - is obviously wrong.

What's more: the pandemic has spread in the suburbs just as readily as it has spread in the built-up cities. Irrespective of the density of your neighborhood, you still have to go grocery shopping, visit your pharmacy, etc.

And if you get sick in a city, you have a better chance of getting care, because high-density living can sustain higher densities of both medical facilities and medical experts.

The pandemic is a runup for the waves of (far deadlier) emergencies we will face due to the climate crisis. Cities - which sustain public transit, and free up land for habitat and agriculture - are the only way we'll weather those storms.

Regressing to sprawl in the name of fighting future pandemics is incredibly shortsighted. Think of the crises visited upon our unplanned, sprawling places - the Houston floods, say - and imagine trying to socially distance and treat the sick during one of those disasters.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/reopennc-sales.png"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Unmasking the registrants of the "reopen" websites (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/22/filternet/#krebs"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

One of the best cybercrime sleuths is Brian Krebs. He used Domaintools to list out all the "reopen*.com" domains registered in the past month, finding ~150. The registrants of most of these were redacted by the registrars, but that didn't stop Krebs.

&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/whos-behind-the-reopen-domain-surge/"&gt;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/whos-behind-the-reopen-domain-surge/&lt;/a&gt;

By cross-referencing things like Google Analytics identifiers, Krebs was able to assemble a (remarkably short) list of shadowy figures behind this (very long) list of "Reopen" domains.

The rogues' gallery starts with the Dorr Brothers, a pair of grifters who target gullible musketfuckers by running scare stories about looming gun confiscations leading to prominent donation boxes that suck dollars out of these bedwetting ammosexuals.

&lt;a href="https://www.dorrbrotherscams.com/p/how-dorr-brothers-work.html"&gt;https://www.dorrbrotherscams.com/p/how-dorr-brothers-work.html&lt;/a&gt;

Next up, Freedomworks, an astroturf org founded with Koch money and funded since with great sluicings of dark money, last seen as the organizing force behind the Tea Party.

&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/57f673f31fb343042e3806b9806e8f7d"&gt;https://apnews.com/57f673f31fb343042e3806b9806e8f7d&lt;/a&gt;

Below them, a bunch of local GOP orgs: the Orange County Republicans, the Horry County, SC Conservative Republicans, etc.

Then it's "In Pursuit Of LLC," a Koch-founded org whose employees include several current and former Trump White House staffers.

&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/12/07/charles-koch-launches-marketing-firm-major-overhaul-political-empire/95109784/"&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/12/07/charles-koch-launches-marketing-firm-major-overhaul-political-empire/95109784/&lt;/a&gt;

Here's a spreadsheet with domains and known or likely registrants.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/636252699725611477-Charter-Spectrum-logo.png.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Covid burns through Charter Cable employees (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/22/filternet/#thomas-rutledge-murderer"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Charter is the garbage company I have to buy my internet from, due to their monopolistic arrangement with my city, Burbank.

Charter doesn't give its field techs hazard pay or PPE. Instead they get $25 gift cards for (closed down) restaurants.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/28/unreciprocated-solidarity/#charter-sucks"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/28/unreciprocated-solidarity/#charter-sucks&lt;/a&gt;

Charter's CEO, Thomas Rutledge, an asshole, decreed that back-office staff would have to keep going to work, even if they could work from home, on the theory that they would be more productive under the watchful eye of their managers.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/18/diy-tp/#sociopathy"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/18/diy-tp/#sociopathy&lt;/a&gt;

(He forced a whistleblower who complained to resign)

You will never, ever guess what happened next.

At least 230 Charter employees now have covid-19. NY Attorney General Letitia James has opened an inquiry into corporate culpability in their illness.

&lt;a name="castmembers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/dollarDisneyland.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Disney heiress slams top execs' compensation (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/22/filternet/#castmembers"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Abigail Disney is the outspoken, anti-corporatist Disney heiress - granddaughter of Roy Disney - and she's really angry about the company's decision to furlough 100,000 front-line workers.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1252665806334410752"&gt;https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1252665806334410752&lt;/a&gt;

She points out that the top exec paycuts that the company has announced are effectively meaningless, because top Disney management's compensation is only incidentally derived from their salaries.

The meat of Disney's exec compensation comes from the $1.5B it pays out in bonuses every year, and that figure has not been affected by the company's belt-tightening.

Former CEO Bob Iger, despite foregoing his salary, will still take home 900X the median worker's salary (this despite two shareholder votes to rein in exec pay).

Disney fought hard against a $15 wage for Parks employees, but since they won it, the company spun it for PR.

But the $15 wage is now $0, because those workers are furloughed. Iger's pay-packet could fully cover the annual wages of 1,500 of them. CEO Bob Chapek (who used to run the Parks division), will still take home 288 Parks workers' annual pay.

And, as Abigail Disney points out, these executive bonuses are being paid to a team that greenlit $11.5B in stock buybacks, which drained the company's cash reserves. Today, the company is BORROWING billions to stay afloat during the crisis.

Bonuses should reward foresight and good judgment. Plunging the company into debt through financial engineering is not evidence of either. As Abigail Disney says, though the pandemic wasn't foreseeable, an emergency of some kind certainly was.

Abigail Disney finishes by calling on the company management to show true leadership by foregoing all of their compensation, not just their salaries - to share in the pain that the 100,000 furloughed workers are going to endure.

These, after all, are the workers whom the leadership showers with honeyed words ("Our ability to do good in the world starts with our cast members . . . who create magic every day. Our commitment to them will always be our top priority." -R Chapek).

Those honeyed words are justified, as it happens. Disney Parks employees don't just do an excellent job - they also represent storehouses of esoteric knowledge about the peccadilloes and idosyncracies of a bunch of bespoke buildings and machines.

These are effectively giant mechanical cocktail shakers that the company puts the richest, most litigious people in the world into for 12+ hours/day, 365 days/year. The company needs the skilled operators and staffers to come back.

Working at a Disney Park - even in food service, custodial, etc - requires a bunch of specialized knowledge that can't be entirely conveyed through training alone. The continuity of culture and knowledge passed among staffers is key.

If that continuity is shattered, it will add years of disruption to the Parks' operation: breakdowns, customer service failures, logistical snarls, etc. Keeping that furloughed workforce intact isn't just "decent" (as Abigail Disney writes), it's also business-critical.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Scarfolk_blindeye.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Scarfolk on Cumgate (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/26/pandemic-profiteers/#private-law"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

With ruling elites making such a lethal mess of things, the pandemic is a kind of make-or-break for political satire - how to top powerful peoples' self-lampooning conduct without seeming callous or broad?

Enter Scarfolk.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/31/reality-endorses-sanders/#richard-littler"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/31/reality-endorses-sanders/#richard-littler&lt;/a&gt;

Scarfolk is a fictional English horror-town set in a looping 1970s, in which Thacherism rises and rises and rises. Today, Scarfolk tackles #cumgate, in which Dominic Cummings, advisor to the UK Prime Minister and architect of the lockdown, flagrantly flouted his own rules.

Scarfolk's "Government Employee Eye-Test Slide" nails the law-and-order Tories' incredible leaps of logic that forgave Cummings conduct even as everyday people are enduring privation and violence to follow the rules.

&lt;a href="https://scarfolk.blogspot.com/2020/05/government-employee-eye-test-slide-1970s.html"&gt;https://scarfolk.blogspot.com/2020/05/government-employee-eye-test-slide-1970s.html&lt;/a&gt;

As Maria Farrell writes on Crooked Timber, Cummings' cross-country drive needs to be understood in the context of the women who have been murdered by their partners because Cummings' own rules did not allow them to leave their homes.

&lt;a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2020/05/26/fatherland/"&gt;https://crookedtimber.org/2020/05/26/fatherland/&lt;/a&gt;

Not least because Cummings' playbook ("deny all wrongdoing," "attack the victim," "reverse victim and offender") track so neatly to the way that abusers talk about their crimes.

This Tory exceptionalism is no aberration: "Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protectes but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect."

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#mafia-logic"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#mafia-logic&lt;/a&gt;

(taken from a Crooked Timber comment by Frank Wilhoit):

&lt;a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288"&gt;https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288&lt;/a&gt;

BTW, if you're struggling to get your head around Cumgate, here's Maureen Johnson's masterful (and colorful) summary:

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/1264966069443231745"&gt;https://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/1264966069443231745&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;a name="profiteering"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/new-york-urban-city-manhattan.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Texas profiteers make bank from NYC's homeless (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/26/pandemic-profiteers/#profiteering"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

NYC has taken the laudable, necessary step of finding housing for homeless people in the city's otherwise empty hotels. Less laudable: they outsourced the management of this to Crewfacilities.com LLC, a Texas company that's gouging the city.

&lt;a href="https://thecity.nyc/2020/05/texas-firm-reaps-millions-booking-covid-hotel-rooms-for-nyc.html"&gt;https://thecity.nyc/2020/05/texas-firm-reaps-millions-booking-covid-hotel-rooms-for-nyc.html&lt;/a&gt;

Crewfacilities is making $27/room/night, plus $18/breakfast, $19/lunch and $34/dinner. On top of that, Crewfacilities is renting rooms at FAR above market rates: $128-$163/night, while the same rooms are bookable online for $75-89.

These rates were all classified as "trade secrets" by the city government, but journalists from The City obtained "an unredacted copy of a related document" with the true figures.

Crewfacilities in based in Austin and has never done business with NYC before. Its contract caps the total allocation for hotels at $250m, and apparently allows it to charge commissions vastly in excess of the industry standard 10% ($2.5m to date) - making $3k/person.

What's more, Crewfacilities is billing the city for meals in hotels that don't even serve meals! These hotels are largely housing health workers who get fed at their hospitals. Crewfacilities' president Andrea Tsakanikas did not respond to The City's request for comment.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;a name="flying-blind"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/paiLost-season1.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FCC's willful broadband blindness in a pandemic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/26/pandemic-profiteers/#flying-blind"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

After more than a decade of ridicule and dismissal, it's no longer possible to deny that broadband is a human right, nor is it possible to deny that private monopolists suck at safeguarding this right.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#fiber-now"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#fiber-now&lt;/a&gt;

To understand how badly broadband monopolists failed, just look at the bankruptcy docs from Frontier. The company chose not to make a $800m profit providing 100gb fiber to its customers because making long-term investments would hurt its stock price.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/01/icann-can-and-did/#fiber-now"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/01/icann-can-and-did/#fiber-now&lt;/a&gt;

As these failures become more manifest, even the FCC has finally acknowledged that it has to do better in providing broadband to underserved communities, pledging $9b to this effort.

Unfortunately, nobody knows where those underserved communities are, because the FCC has allowed monopolists to draw up deceptive and inaccurate coverage maps for years.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/16/new-old-apples/#not-the-territory"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/16/new-old-apples/#not-the-territory&lt;/a&gt;

For example - as the WSJ writes - the FCC allowed carriers to claim that they covered a whole neighborhood if they provided broadband to a single home.

&lt;a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/20/05/25/1859259/in-16-billion-push-to-expand-broadband-america-is-flying-through-a-fog"&gt;https://news.slashdot.org/story/20/05/25/1859259/in-16-billion-push-to-expand-broadband-america-is-flying-through-a-fog&lt;/a&gt;

And as if that wasn't grifty enough, the carriers were allowed to draw their own maps of what constituted a "neighborhood," ensuring that each neighborhood boundary captured one house where they could provide coverage without any capex.

The Journal calls this "flying through a fog." The fraudulent coverage maps have left regulators and lawmakers with nothing but (ghastly) anaecdotes, and only the carriers know the true state of their coverage.

Unfortunately, it's vanishingly unlikely that Ajit Pai, the most captured FCC Chairman in a generation, will demand that they turn those accurate maps over. Instead, he'll just insist on apportioning billions in broadband subsidies without know where they're needed.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;a name="bezzlers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/jumpscrapyard.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Uber is scrapping thousands of Jump bikes (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/26/pandemic-profiteers/#bezzlers"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

One of my favorite expressions of disgust is "The only time I wouldn't piss on him is if he was on fire."

Well, the world is on fire and the only time I wouldn't piss on Uber's Jump dockless ebikes is in a pandemic, when bicycle transport has never been more essential.

Uber - and other dockless transport companies like Bird - unilaterally filled our cities' streets with ewaste litter - unsafe electric vehicles that endangered their riders and pedestrians in use, and blocked sidewalks for wheelchair users the rest of the time.

These companies compounded their misdeeds by refusing to help track down customers who had hit-and-run pedestrians, even when their customers' victims were critically injured.

(and, of course, Bird threatened to sue me for explaining how you could buy their abandoned vehicles from city impounds and convert them to personal vehicles)

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/01/11/flipping-the-bird.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2019/01/11/flipping-the-bird.html&lt;/a&gt;

But you know what? There's a pandemic on. People - especially vulnerable, low-waged, "essential" workers are going to great lengths to avoid public transit. Bike riding is resurgent.

All is forgiven, Uber.

Oh, wait.

Uber has scrapped 20,000 of its Jump bicycles because of a fall in revenue, sending them to the landfill rather than continuing to service them or donating them to the cities they colonized with them.

&lt;a href="https://bikesharemuseum.com/20000-jump-bikes-are-going-to-die/"&gt;https://bikesharemuseum.com/20000-jump-bikes-are-going-to-die/&lt;/a&gt;

What's more, after they were caught, Uber lied about it - only to have their official narrative contradicted by internal whistleblowers who confirmed to Bikeshare Museum that the bikes are being scrapped "by the containerload." And they've got pics.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bikesharemuseum/status/1265082035380670465"&gt;https://twitter.com/bikesharemuseum/status/1265082035380670465&lt;/a&gt;

Uber has also fired the entire engineering team for Jump - a team that scratch-designed an entirely new set of internals that they alone know how to maintain and fix. Ebay is filling up with salvaged parts.

"We also can’t emphasize enough how disgusting it is for UBER to scrap 20,000 bikes in the midst of a pandemic where bicycles have literally become an object of survival.These could be transportation for the many who have been brought to financial ruin during COVID-19."

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;a name="quiet-part-outloud"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/trumpmsakslip.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;White Americans are increasingly opposed to democracy (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/26/pandemic-profiteers/#quiet-part-outloud"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In "The Effect of White Social Prejudice on Support for American Democracy," a pair of political scientists used data from the World Values Survey to analyze the rise of authoritarian, anti-democratic rhetoric among American white people.

&lt;a href="https://github.com/svmiller/woi/blob/master/ms.pdf"&gt;https://github.com/svmiller/woi/blob/master/ms.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

The authors released a prepub of their work last year; as I wrote then, "White Americans abandoned democracy and embraced authoritarianism when they realized brown people would soon outvote them."

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/05/30/pissed-on-by-trickledown.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2018/05/30/pissed-on-by-trickledown.html&lt;/a&gt;

The paper has now been accepted for publication in the Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics, and this has spurred fresh attention for the study and its conclusions.

&lt;a href="http://svmiller.com/research/white-social-prejudice-support-american-democracy/"&gt;http://svmiller.com/research/white-social-prejudice-support-american-democracy/&lt;/a&gt;

Writing on NBC, Noah Berlatsky invokes the neo-Nazi Richard Spencer, who said "We need an ethno-state so that our people can ‘come home again’… We must give up the false dreams of equality and democracy."

But he could just as readily have cited Peter Theil's avowed belief that "freedom" is incompatible with "democracy" (because in a democratic system, plutocrats would be outvoted and thus not free to exploit the rest of us).

This is why the GOP is so committed to voter suppression - and why the real  strategic battleground of the civil rights era was voter-registration, not lunch-counters.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/31/reality-endorses-sanders/#voter-suppression"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/31/reality-endorses-sanders/#voter-suppression&lt;/a&gt;

But after a brief flirtation with luring conservative, Catholic latinx people to the GOP by making abortion into a wedge issue, the party abandoned that strategy and pivoted to Trumpism, which, at its core, denies the legitimacy racialized people's claims of Americanness.

That's why armed white militias are demanding to know if American indigenous people are "legal." "Legal" doesn't mean "legally in the USA" - it means "white."

&lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2018/02/02/trump-supporter-illegal-immigration-native-american-legal-arizona-snopes/302350002/"&gt;https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2018/02/02/trump-supporter-illegal-immigration-native-american-legal-arizona-snopes/302350002/&lt;/a&gt;

But after years of turkeys voting for Christmas, the GOP is struggling to get poor whites to vote for plutocracy - workers are skeptical of claims that they need to submit gracefully to being thrown into a volcano to appease the economy gods.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/08/volcano-gods/#reopening"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/08/volcano-gods/#reopening&lt;/a&gt;

Which makes the authoritarian turn in US politics all the more frightening - the farmer may have convinced the turkeys to vote for Christmas with honeyed words and big promises, but when the day comes, he's not above wringing their necks.

And while I'm as furious as I can be with the Democratic party, its corporate sellouts, and its garbage policies, the authoritarian turn is mostly owned by the GOP.

"The GOP has dug itself into such a hole on this that the most practical effort to stave off these impending losses is to disenfranchise the votes of the same ethnic/racial outgroups against whom GOP messaging has been stoking animosity.

"Social intolerance isn't just leading to GOP support as we know it and see it now. It's leading to preferences in favor of the kind of candidate the GOP ultimately nominated and supported for president." -Coauthor Steven V Miller

&lt;h1&gt;Parts Found in Sea (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/31/parts-found-in-sea/#"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When I was a young teen, I was obsessed with the Toronto music scene, which is hilarious, because I was too young to get into any of the clubs where it was taking place, like the legendary Larry's Hideaway (believe me, I tried).

But I would obsessively note the names of the bands whose handbills were wheatpasted up and down Yonge Street and scour the bins at Sam the Record Man for their self-produced EPs and then play them over and over.

Some of those bands were...not good.

But I was absolutely obsessed with one band: Parts Found in Sea, whose name was taken from a newspaper headline about a plane crash (!). They were a damned hardworking act, playing - it seemed - every weekend at Larry's.

Since the Napster era, I have been periodically scouring the web for MP3s of the band, for sale, for free, whatever. I just wanted to hear them again.

Sometimes you revisit the music of your youth and realize that what made it good was that your own lack of sophistication - you didn't have the context to make the comparisons with other bands, didn't know that you were hearing a weak imitation of something amazing.

I feared that must be the case with PFIS: the fact that none of their music was available might mean that it just wasn't very good, and hadn't stood the test of time.

Then I discovered Stevy Zong's Youtube video of a live PFIS show at Larry's Hideaway and hearing that music again only renewed my ardor for the band. I also learned the name for their genre: "Darkwave."

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNW89ZLKwSw"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNW89ZLKwSw&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://pluralistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/animation-15.gif"&gt;

(It was also great to see them perform live, at last! The band was dissolved and Larry's was out of buiness by the time I was old enough to get into the club)

Inspired by that video, I bought a "Seat of the Writing Man," one of my favorite EPs by the band, on Ebay, and asked my friendly neighborhood archivist, Taylor Jessen, if he'd rip the vinyl for me, and he very kindly did, sending me the tracks last night.

And the band is every bit as good as I remember. I mean, just fucking great. Especially the Frank Lippai's bass-playing, which is just...wow. As far as I can tell, Lippai is living in London, Ont now, running something called "Artisans Almighty," but that's all I've got.

Frontman Steve Cowal graduated to a semi-famous Canadian band, Swamp Baby, and was featured in Bruce McDonald's "Hardcore Logo," but I can't find anything he's doing these days.

&lt;a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0116488/?ref_=m_nmfmd_msdp_1"&gt;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0116488/?ref_=m_nmfmd_msdp_1&lt;/a&gt;

The EP really showcases some spectacular talent, right down to the engineering by Ken Friesen, who is still working:

&lt;a href="https://www.kenfriesen.com/"&gt;https://www.kenfriesen.com/&lt;/a&gt;

And while some of Cowal's lyrics are a little over-the-top emo, the songs are beautifully constructed, these long, jam-band-ish tracks that have two or three movements apiece, transitioning through different moods. They must have been amazing to dance to at a club.

I just couldn't keep this disc to myself. I've uploaded it for your listening pleasure, but only for 24 HOURS. Tomorrow morning (Pacific), I'll be deleting it. I figure that strikes a balance between celebration and misappropriation.

&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/pfi-s-sot-wm-lp-obverse"&gt;https://archive.org/details/pfi-s-sot-wm-lp-obverse&lt;/a&gt;

But if anyone out there is looking to reissue some wonderful audio unobtanium, they should track down the band and get these tracks into the stream of commerce.

&lt;h1&gt;2019 Nebula Award winners (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/31/parts-found-in-sea/#nebs"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Last night, the Science Fiction Writers of America held its first-ever virtual Nebula Awards, handing out prizes for excellence in the field that had been voted on by its members - the writers' own peers.

&lt;a href="https://nebulas.sfwa.org/award-year/2019/"&gt;https://nebulas.sfwa.org/award-year/2019/&lt;/a&gt;

As ever, the list is a brilliant tour through the year's work, and I'm especially pleased by the best novel winner, Sarah Pinsker, who won for "A Song for a New Day," which I reviewed and blurbed.

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/09/23/hoodies-considered-harmful.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2019/09/23/hoodies-considered-harmful.html&lt;/a&gt;

"Song" has a bit of (un?)fortunate timing, in that it is about gig economy workers in an oligarchic, locked-down world where pandemic and terrorist have everyone in the country locked inside, permanently, dependent on an Amazon-like company for drone deliveries.

It's a great rock-n-roll novel, about the underground club scene that flourishes in this all-too-familiar totalitarian world - and how it is co-opted by entertainment corporations - and how it ultimately resists co-option and fights a war of liberation.

Congrats to all the winners and nominees!

&lt;h1&gt;Why Minneapolis can't fire violent cops (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/31/parts-found-in-sea/#acab-spring"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

If you're following the wave of uprisings against racist police violence, you've probably heard that Derek Chauvin, the cop who murdered George Floyd, had a long history of criminal conduct, but was still carrying a gun, wearing a badge, and billing the taxpayer.

Chauvin was no aberration. Minneapolis, like many cities, has a police crime problem - that is, a problem addressing the crimes committed by its own police force, thanks to a combination of impunity, white supremacy, opacity, and militarization.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/29/mind-control-skepticism/#qualified-immunity"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/29/mind-control-skepticism/#qualified-immunity&lt;/a&gt;

Even where police reforms are enacted, the forces ignore them...and get away with it. That happened in Minneapolis. As The Marshall Project documents, a half-decade after the DoJ investigated problems with Minneapolis's police, virtually nothing has changed.

&lt;a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/28/before-george-floyd-s-death-minneapolis-police-failed-to-adopt-reforms-remove-bad-officers"&gt;https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/28/before-george-floyd-s-death-minneapolis-police-failed-to-adopt-reforms-remove-bad-officers&lt;/a&gt;

In Minneapolis, policing was supposed to be moderated by use-of-force guidelines (which officers ignored), "coaching" programs (which were inconsistent and chaotic), and automated misconduct detection (whose data the public can't see).

As to why the cops got away with it, consider that the police union boss Lt Bob Kroll kept his job even after he showed up for work with a white power badge on his uniform.

You might have wondered why Chauvin's colleagues stood idly by as he committed murder in broad daylight. It's a little easier to understand when you know that some of those cops also had long histories of committing violent crimes with impunity.

Like Officer Tou Thao, who knocked out Lamar Ferguson's arrest in 2017, but got to keep his job, even as the taxpayers of Minneapolis shelled out $25,000 to settle with Thao's victim.

Minnesota's state legislature has failed to pass even one of the dozen+ police reform bills tabled in the state house. Meanwhile, the state's Peace Officers Standards and Training Board is a toothless tiger, with no power to sanction or remove criminal officers.

There's a bipartisan consensus on impunity for criminal cops. Think of Bill De Blasio blaming protesters after NYPD officers drove their cruisers through a protest, re-enacting the murder of Heather Heyer.

Or consider how Amy Klobuchar, who, as Minneapolis's top prosecutor, declined to prosecute Derek Chauvin, giving him license to commit a string of crimes that culminated in the daylight murder of George Floyd.

On July 7, Hank Green's publishing "A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor," the sequel to his outstanding 2018 debut "An Absolutely Remarkable Thing."

That also happens to be the day that Tor is reissuing Little Brother and its sequel Homeland, in a new omnibus edition with an intro by Edward Snowden (!).

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250774583"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250774583&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781250774583.jpg"&gt;

I read "Endeavor" for a blurb and just loved it, so when Hank asked me if I'd do a virtual bookstore event on Jul 10 with Minneapolis's Magers and Quinn as part of his tour, of course I said yes!

&lt;a href="https://ew.com/books/exclusive-hank-green-virtual-summer-book-tour/"&gt;https://ew.com/books/exclusive-hank-green-virtual-summer-book-tour/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/HankGreenTourCard_Final Edit.png"&gt;

Hank's virtual tour includes several other stops, many with his brother John Green, and also with Ashley C Ford and Roman Mars.

&lt;h1&gt;Facebook Workplace can block employees from discussing unionization (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/13/robopinkertons/#robopinkerton"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Facebook makes a Slack competitor called "Facebook Workplace," with marquee customers like the government of Singapore, Walmart, Discovery Communications, Starbucks, and Campbell Soup Corporation.

On Wednesday, the company demonstrated a new suite of features for Workplace, including the ability to censor certain words or topics from the system. The example they chose? "Unionize."

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/06/11/facebook-workplace-unionize/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2020/06/11/facebook-workplace-unionize/&lt;/a&gt;

The company took the presentation down the next day and told Lee Fang that "this example was poorly chosen and should never have been used. The feature was only in early development and we’ve pulled any plans to roll it out while we think through next steps."

As Fang points out, Facebook has a curious approach to content moderation, maintaining that it cannot remove Donald Trump's calls for protesters to be shot, while equipping employers with tools to prevent employees from discussing collective bargaining.

This is particularly salient in an age of telework, where employees may no longer be gathering face to face (and indeed, many tech workplaces are proposing to continue telework after the pandemic is over).

In the time of the company town, firms used the pretense that they owned the houses workers slept in and the streets they walked to work as an excuse to ban labor organizing, saying that these activities were banned by the owners of this private property.

We've inverted this in the 21st century, where your employer can force you to convert your private home into a branch office of their company, and then order you to conduct yourself as though you were on their property.

Such an obviously inequitable demand won't work on its own: it needs an enforcement mechanism. Your employer isn't ready to send Pinkertons with fixed bayonets to your spare room (yet), but Facebook, as ever, is ready to be the robopinkerton, omnipresent and ever-vigilant.

&lt;a name="Avi-Schiffmann"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/schiffmanncovid.png"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Secrets of a seventeen year old scraper (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/13/robopinkertons/#Avi-Schiffmann"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Even if you don't follow Avi Schiffmann, you're probably familiar with the 17-year-old's work: he's the creator of http://nCoV2019.live and http://2020Protests.com, the two leading tracking tools for covid cases and protests you can join.

In an interview with Tanya Basu for MIT Tech Review, Schiffmann describes how he taught himself to build these dashboards when he made a site that scraped his school's athletic stats portal and made it legible and useful.

&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/12/1002838/avi-schiffmann-17-year-old-guide-building-pandemic-protest-tracker/"&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/12/1002838/avi-schiffmann-17-year-old-guide-building-pandemic-protest-tracker/&lt;/a&gt;

When he decided to use those skills to build his covid tracker, he put a call out on some coding sites and attracted a dozen high-school aged volunteers, many in Asia, who helped write the scrapers that pull in the data for http://nCoV2019.live.

As the project grew more sophisticated and then begat his protest tracker, he used online tutorials and communities to acquire the knowledge he needed to overcome new challenges ("The thing is, you can learn anything online").

Since the first days of the maker movement, it's been clear that the ability to search and discuss is the major thing that differentiates "makers" from earlier generations of tinkerers, like the radio and electronics hobbyists that kept Modern Mechanix in business.

Schiffmann is a self-confessed "bad student" with a 1.7GPA and 60% attendance, which he attributes to his consuming passion for his programming projects. It's a testament to how much of pedagogy turns on getting out of the student's way when their passions are inflamed.

I read my first novel - Alice in Wonderland - one day in second grade. I pulled it off the shelf before class started and sat on the carpet to read it, and my teacher, Bev Panikkar, saw that I was engrossed in it and didn't call me to class.

She let me sit there for two consecutive school days while I read, and while I was kicking off a lifelong passion for literature (also, I married a woman called Alice!).

As interesting as the pedagogical and makerish implications of Schiffmann's story, I'm also fascinated by the role that scraping plays in making these essential information resources.

Scraping went from a honorable practice (the core of Google Search, for example) to a potential felony over the course of decades, as companies that made their fortunes scraping others turned around and sued, banned and blocked anyone who returned the favor.

But scraping is one of the key tools for attaining Adversarial Interoperability, which once kept tech dynamic and responsive to users, and the absence of which has contributed greatly to its stagnation and corruption.

&lt;h1&gt;Facebook endorses Terra Nullius (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/13/robopinkertons/#filternet"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The people who perpetrated genocidal settler colonialism needed a way to square their slaughter and theft with their conception of themselves as moral actors. They settled their consciences with the doctrine of "terra nullius."

Terra nullius - empty land - is a variation on Locke's labor theory of value, the idea that the only thing you can be said to truly own is  your body and its labor, and when you blend your labor with natural resources, the finished product is yours.

Locke is a key grifter thinkfluencer, because at the core of Locke's theory is the idea that there are natural things that no one else is using for you to come along and pick up and blend with your labor to turn into property.

Inevitably "stuff no one is using" turns out to be a fancy way of saying "stuff that is widely used by people I consider to be subhuman."

So when settler colonialists arrived in Australia, they declared it to be empty land, and the people who'd lived there for as long as behaviorally modern humans have existed to be non-persons.

This relegation to subhuman status created the conditions for genocide, enslavement, torture, rape, and more.

The Australian establishment's means of escaping this legacy is to simply pretend it doesn't exist.

That's why Australian PM (and noted piece of shit) Scott Morrison's response to the Black Lives Matter protests in Australia by flatly stating that there was "no slavery in Australia" and accusing protesters of not being "honest about our history."

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/11/was-there-slavery-in-australia-yes-it-shouldnt-even-be-up-for-debate"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/11/was-there-slavery-in-australia-yes-it-shouldnt-even-be-up-for-debate&lt;/a&gt;

Morrison's claims are easily refuted. For example, the State Library of Western Australia has an 1896 image of enslaved aboriginal people in neck-chains, outside Roebourne Gaol. This image was posted to Facebook as part of the discourse of Australia's history of slavery.

But it was immediately removed by Facebook's nudity filter, a fully automated machine learning system that enforces the system's "community standards." The user who posted it had his account restricted in punishment for violating these standards.

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/13/facebook-incorrectly-removes-picture-of-aboriginal-men-in-chains-because-of-nudity"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/13/facebook-incorrectly-removes-picture-of-aboriginal-men-in-chains-because-of-nudity&lt;/a&gt;

Facebook removed 39.5m "nudity" images in the first quarter of this year. At that rate, you won't be surprised to learn that more than 99% of these removals were fully automated and untouched by human hands.

It's true that FB is largely free from nudity, and this fact is often cited by advocates of other kinds of filtering - say, copyright filtering - as evidence that FB COULD block the content they object to, but it chooses not to.

In a sense, those critics are correct. FB has demonstrated that it is willing to accept immense collateral damage from its filtering - whether that's censoring survivors of terrorist atrocities in the name of filtering out "extremist content."

Or blocking images that prove the genocidal history of a nation at a moment when its leadership is denying that history even exists.

FB doesn't intend to block this speech, but it knows this "overblocking" is inevitable when it turns over moderation to automated filters.

By its actions, FB is telling us that this is an acceptable price to pay.

But that doesn't mean that filtering on broader criteria - harassment, profanity, libel, copyright infringement - is just more of the same. These categories are FAR broader than "nudity."

What's more, the consequences of overblocking are far more damaging to the purpose these filters are supposed to serve. A copyright filter that is supposed to protect artists and then goes on to censor artistic work that's mistaken for infringement &lt;em&gt;harms&lt;/em&gt; artists.

An "extremist content" filter that is supposed to protect us from terrorist violence and then goes on to block the images and stories of survivors of that violence literally adds insult to injury.

An anti-harassment filter that blocks the discussions of harassment targets who describe the words used to harass them helps harassers, not their victims.

FB got 2.5 million takedown appeals in Q1/2020, and restored 613,000 pieces of content. Even if you accept the dubious claim that FB's human checkers got it right, that's 613,000 acts of illegitimate censorship.

As for the photo of the enslaved aboriginal people, it was restored too -- after The Guardian's Josh Taylor asked FB embarrassing questions about the removal.

"Getting reporters to take up your cause" is not a scalable solution to errors in mass automated filtering.

FB can't moderate at scale. No one can. Adding filters "works" in the sense that you can block most "bad content" if you don't care how much good content gets blocked by mistake alongside of it.

And the fallout from this overblocking is not evenly distributed. Not only are some disfavored minorities (sex workers, queer people, people of color) more likely to have their discussions censored.

They're also less likely to have access to reporters who'll embarrass FB and it into taking action.

The answer isn't to lard FB with more censorship duties for it to fuck up even worse - it's to cut FB down to size, to a scale where communities can set and enforce norms.

Because the problem with FB isn't merely that Mark Zuckerberg is uniquely unsuited to making decisions about the social lives and political discourse of 2.6 billion people.

It's that &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; is capable of doing that job. That job should not exist.

PS: Scott Morrisson retracted his no-slavery claim:

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/12/scott-morrison-sorry-for-no-slavery-in-australia-claim-and-acknowledges-hideous-practices"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/12/scott-morrison-sorry-for-no-slavery-in-australia-claim-and-acknowledges-hideous-practices&lt;/a&gt;

PPS: if you try to post about this to FB, your post will be blocked for "nudity".

&lt;h1&gt;LA schools returned grenade launchers, kept assault rifles (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/14/with-nnedi-today-4pm/#leso"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The Defense Logistics Agency's Law Enforcement Support Office operates the 1033 program, through which the US military buys weapons it doesn't need, then passes them on as "surplus" to police departments, including school police departments.

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement_Support_Office"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement_Support_Office&lt;/a&gt;

So it's not just big-city police departments that have MRAPs (gunless tanks), assault rifles, and the other trappings of an occupying army; nor is it merely small town forces that go about like they're patrolling Mosul.

It's &lt;em&gt;school cops&lt;/em&gt;.

The LA Unified School District is one of the districts whose cops get military weapons to use in connection with schoolchildren.

In 2014, LAUSD returned its 3 grenade launchers.

They kept their assault rifles, though.

&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-schools-weapons-20140917-story.html"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-schools-weapons-20140917-story.html&lt;/a&gt;

LAUSD had procured 61 M-16 rifles through 1033. They also got an MRAP, and they kept that, too.

They called the rifles "essential life-saving items."

Writing in the LA Times in 2014, Stephen Ceasar interviewed Stockton school police Chief Bryon Gustafson about his school's stockpile of AR-15s. The Chief's response is as good an explanation of why we need to defund the police as you're apt to see.

"The job of police officers and the standards are the same whether you are Stockton police or Stockton school police … even if we have very different missions. My job is about facilitating education and making sure that students are safe at school."

If you think that "facilitating education" involves an AR-15, you should not be allowed within 10 miles of any educational institution, for the rest of your life.

&lt;h1&gt;Black box voting (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/14/with-nnedi-today-4pm/#ess"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

At least half of the voting machines in use in America come from Election Systems &amp;amp; Software, including the systems used by Broward County, whose Supervisor of Elections is ultimately responsible for running the county's polling places.

&lt;a href="https://thewestsidegazette.com/election-data-sits-in-a-database-county-election-office-is-denied-access/"&gt;https://thewestsidegazette.com/election-data-sits-in-a-database-county-election-office-is-denied-access/&lt;/a&gt;

Investigative data analyst Perry Busby asked the SOE about some discrepancies discovered by the nonpartisan Broward Citizens Audit initiative's investigation of the March 17 primary. He was seeking details of the way the system's SQL databases tabulate the vote.

This is the most fundamental question about how a voting machine works, and Busby naturally assumed the SOE Pete Antonacci and his team could answer his query, but instead, the SOE's office told Busby that ES&amp;amp;S; does not give them a working login to &lt;em&gt;their own voting machines&lt;/em&gt;.

"We can log into the server where the SQL Server database files are located, but we don’t have user access to the database." - John Wolf, Broward County election office IT Director.

ES&amp;amp;S; is owned by the secretive private equity giant McClatchy Group, and processes some 70m US votes in national elections. It has a long history of suing cities and competitors when ESS contracts are canceled in favor of a rival's products.

The company has also sued citizen groups calling for voting transparency, and, as Busby points out, ES&amp;amp;S; systems have been at the center of many scandals, especially in predominantly Black precincts, with hundreds of thousands of votes disappearing.

And yet the company refuses to provide the election officials that buy its products with logins that allow them to verify the most basic functions of its machines.

As Busby discovered, ES&amp;amp;S; threatens to cancel the contracts of any election official who independently audits their machines and "automatically revoke all results pending certification."

ES&amp;amp;S; says it's "a preventative measure to reduce the risk of record tampering."

&lt;h1&gt;Politics and sf (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/17/on-face-interaction/#nnedi"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Last weekend, Nnedi Okarafor and I did a really fun, wide-ranging panel on politics and sf for Tor Books' TorCon, moderated by Kayti Burt; it was the closing panel, and Tor has transcribed some of the highlights.

&lt;a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/06/16/read-highlights-from-cory-doctorow-and-nnedi-okorafor-in-conversation-at-torcon/"&gt;https://www.tor.com/2020/06/16/read-highlights-from-cory-doctorow-and-nnedi-okorafor-in-conversation-at-torcon/&lt;/a&gt;

We started with our origin stories: I grew up in Toronto under the umbrella of Judith Merril, who was omnipresent and fantastically generous with her time; Nnedi found her sf/f interest came naturally out of the "mystical aspects" of the stories she wanted to tell.

Nnedi talked about how her writing process always starts with characters: "I’ve been writing about this particular character for a pretty long time, and she’s kind of existed in different ways and stories, but writing about her—it started with her."

And we discussed how sf can present "challenging issues and diverse world views for conversation and change."

Nnedi talked about how genre is a "skewed lens" to see painful issues with new eyes, "and when you see it with new eyes, you can see more."

I talked about how sf can give you a (possibly false and sometimes harmful) story to reach for when you need to understand what's going to happen in moments of crisis or extremis:

"As pulp writers, science fiction writers don’t want to confine themselves to man-against-man or man-against nature, we like the plot-forward twofer, where it’s man-against-nature-against-man, where the tsunami blows your house over and your neighbors come over to eat you. That kind of story of the foundational beastiality of humans does make for great storytelling, but it’s not true. That’s not actually what happens in crises.

"In crises, the refrigerator hum of petty grievance stops and leaves behind the silence to make you realize that you have more in common with your neighbors. It’s when people are are their best."

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Robots aren't stealing your job (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/17/on-face-interaction/#zombie-robots"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

You've probably heard a lot about how robutts are coming to steal your jerb, but even a cursory look at both employment stats and the state of automation tell a very different tale.

A pair of essays from Sareeta Amrute, Alex Rosenblat, and Brian Callaci from Data &amp;amp; Society take a deep dive into the reality of precarious employment and its relationship to automation.

In "Why Are Good Jobs Disappearing if Robots Aren’t Taking Them?" the authors blame the disappearance of good jobs not on automation, but on the ability of apps to circumvent employment law (the gig economy).

&lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/why-are-good-jobs-disappearing-if-robots-arent-taking-them-9f8d4845302a"&gt;https://points.datasociety.net/why-are-good-jobs-disappearing-if-robots-arent-taking-them-9f8d4845302a&lt;/a&gt;

Tech also simplifies the process of outsourcing to low-waged, poor workers overseas, and surveillance and real-time predictive tools allow employers to shift the costs of slow business times onto their workers.

We hear a lot about how economic downturns prompt investment in automation, but the authors don't find that. Rather, "firms restructure in response to downturns in ways that create fewer permanent job opportunities than in the past."

Crises allow for permanent changes in employment norms: " What is at risk now, is that the management techniques of gig companies will become protected by U.S. law and embedded in the national economy."

There are few robots on the horizon in the US workplace: "The rate of productivity growth has been slowing, not accelerating, in recent years...At the same time, investments in capital equipment, information processing equipment, and software have been slowing since 2000."

On to part two: "The Robots are Just Automated Management Tools": the hallmarks of the modern workplace are "Surveil, Schedule, Speed Up" and all three are supercharged by tech.

&lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/the-robots-are-just-automated-management-tools-b9bf28c4434"&gt;https://points.datasociety.net/the-robots-are-just-automated-management-tools-b9bf28c4434&lt;/a&gt;

Consider how workplaces use scheduling software to dynamically and unpredictably assign shifts in 15-minute increments, while equipping workers with trackers that monitor their every move and software accelerates the pace of work.

It's cost-shifting, from employers to workers: workers have to be on-call 24/7 but are guaranteed no work;  the breathing time a stock-picker in a warehouse gets before picking up an item is squeezed out by a light beam that skewers the item as soon as they are in position.

But the authors hold out hope for worker power, as the realization that "essential workers" are the lowest-paid, worst-treated among us gives workers a newfound sense of their power and the public a newfound respect for their work.

"In short, the robots are coming, but slowly, and not in the ways they are often portrayed. What’s actually happening is that precarious work is becoming more visible, while management software hides the changing the nature of working conditions."

&lt;h1&gt;Earbuddy (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/17/on-face-interaction/#earbuddy"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

It turns out that earbud mics are sensitive enough to distinguish an entire range of "facial gestures" by listening to the sounds of your filthy fingertips scraping over the delicate pores of your face.

&lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3313831.3376836"&gt;https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3313831.3376836&lt;/a&gt;

Earbuddy is a research project that explores how to "enable on-face interaction" with your computing devices by listening to you as you touch your face; the research team found 27 distinct gestures that they could reliably distinguish in this method.

Leaving aside the epidemiological and dermatological problems of constantly touching your face, this is way cool - it opens an entire interaction vocabulary without any additional hardware sensors, exploiting the material differences between different facial structures.

"For example, the ear rim is primarily composed of cartilage, while the cheek is typically more fleshy. We identified seven areas that can be used for interaction: the temple, the cheek, the mandible angle, the mastoid, and the top/middle/bottom of the ear rim."

The participants learned the gestures quickly; they rated "tapping" as more socially acceptable than "sliding."

It's all very preliminary - just a pilot study, N=24, but they got good results in both noisy and quiet environments, and they only used one side of the face - in theory this means you could double the vocabulary by sensing on the other side, too.

The work was partly funded from a grant-pool dedicated to "Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research," which suggests a whole other realm of use-cases.

&lt;h1&gt;The Worm (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/17/on-face-interaction/#worm"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

"The Worm" is the affectionate nickname for NASA's 1975 logo, designed by Richard Danne and Bruce Blackburn. A new book from Standards Manual, available for pre-order, collects 300+ archival NASA images featuring The Worm in action.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/nasawormbook_spread119-2400.jpg"&gt;

The Worm was deprecated in 1992, but it's back as part of Spacex's livery.

The book comes out in October, and is available for pre-order at $59.

&lt;h1&gt;CDA230 (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/17/on-face-interaction/#content-moderation-at-scale"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

"Free Expression, Harmful Speech and Censorship in a Digital World," a new study from The Knight Foundation and Gallup finds that Americans are notably skeptical of the idea that social media platforms should take a more active role in moderating their content.

&lt;a href="https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KnightFoundation_Panel6-Techlash2_rprt_061220-v2_es-1.pdf"&gt;https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KnightFoundation_Panel6-Techlash2_rprt_061220-v2_es-1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

"The poll found that 80% of Americans don't trust big tech companies to make the right decisions about what content appears on their sites and what should be removed."

&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/americans-dont-trust-content-decisions-made-by-social-media-giants-study-says/"&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/americans-dont-trust-content-decisions-made-by-social-media-giants-study-says/&lt;/a&gt;

The backdrop for the poll is the Trump administration's war on CDA230, a law that places liability for bad speech acts (libel, hate speech, etc) on people who use platforms, not the platforms themselves.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/effs-guide-cda-230-most-important-law-protecting-online-speech"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/effs-guide-cda-230-most-important-law-protecting-online-speech&lt;/a&gt;

Trump has proposed that only platforms that are "neutral" in their moderation policies would receive this protection.

Unfortunately, Trump's view has widespread support from well-meaning progressives, who want more action against harassment and racist invective.

They often say things like, "Facebook can eliminate nudity, why can't they eliminate racism?" The reality is that FB's elimination of nudity (and copyright infringement, etc) is only possible because of unlimited collateral damage to legit speech.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/13/robopinkertons/#filternet"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/13/robopinkertons/#filternet&lt;/a&gt;

And yes, fair enough, that tells us that FB views boobies as a worse problem than genocide.

But the reality of FB's moderation failures underlying its success in purging the platform of nudity should be equally present in these debates.

Big Tech's anti-harassment filters routinely censor survivors of harassment who quote their tormenters.

The anti-extremism filters censor survivors of terrorist violence who describe their ordeals, and scholars who study them.

Anti-sex-trafficking filters block sex workers who want to discuss which clients are potentially violent and other protective dialogs.

Giving Big Tech &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; censorship duties will not make them better at censorship.

There's another telling stat from the study: while 80% of Americans don't trust tech to moderate their conversations, they trust the government even less.

And of course, eliminating 230 gives you both: companies would be charged with more moderation, and governments would check their work.

As I wrote when Facebook nudity-blocked images of enslaved Australian Aboriginal people (posted after the prime minister publicly lied about the country's history of slavery):

"The answer isn't to lard FB with more censorship duties for it to fuck up even worse – it's to cut FB down to size, to a scale where communities can set and enforce norms.

"Because the problem with FB isn't merely that Mark Zuckerberg is uniquely unsuited to making decisions about the social lives and political discourse of 2.6 billion people.

"It's that no one is capable of doing that job. That job should not exist."

&lt;h1&gt;Hue and cry, posses, sheriffs (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/17/on-face-interaction/#before-cops"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Maybe you think cops have been with us forever. Didn't Robin Hood tangle with the Sheriff of Nottingham?

Nope! Sweary medievalist Eleanor Janega: "historically in the global north an established police force... is an extremely new development."

&lt;a href="https://going-medieval.com/2020/06/17/on-a-world-without-police/"&gt;https://going-medieval.com/2020/06/17/on-a-world-without-police/&lt;/a&gt;

In medieval Europe, communities were expected to raise a "hue and cry" when they witnessed a crime, bringing out people to apprehend the perpetrator and bring them to justice.

"Elsewhere, adult men were organized into groups of ten called 'tithings' where each man in the group was tasked with bringing the others to justice if they committed a crime. "

Watchmen (and women) were employed to raise an alarm when they saw crimes. Sheriffs would be called in when the community couldn't catch a criminal, and would draft men over 15 to serve in posses comitatus.

"After 1250 villages would often appoint a Constable who was responsible for raising the hue and cry, a position that rotated yearly and was unpaid to ensure against both corruption and over work."

Medieval justice was more restorative than punitive: "many acts which we would consider as crimes were addressed not through carceral measures, but as disputes which required resolution between the offender and the victims."

Janega's at pains to point out that medieval justice had its own problems, especially "when the powerless and unconnected were found guilty of crimes committed against the powerful."

Rather, her point is that modern policing is &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt;, not an eternal and unchangeable factor.

"Not only is this possible, it has happened in the past. It can happen again, but better. Let’s get to it."

&lt;h1&gt;Bojo's "New Deal" is neither (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/05/pluralistic-05-jul-2020/#tory-scum"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Whenever I think of grifters, I get that classic image of an overconfident, self-destructive idiot racing across a river on the backs of alligators, certain that they won't stumble and lose a leg. See, for example, DJ Trump.

Or Boris Johnson.

You know that grifter tactic of putting a scandal behind you by creating a bigger scandal? That's pure gator-dancing.

Grifters love debt - spending other peoples' money is Grifter 101. But it's not just money-debt - it's also policy debt.

If you have a real problem and a fake solution, the real problem will continue to fester until it becomes so acute that you have a rupture, a default, a leg chewed off. The grifter way of dealing with this is blowing town before the rupture.

The snake-oil salesman who prescribes alternating doses of speed and opioids to "cure your cancer" stays long enough to witness your stoned, energized delight and collect his fee, then gtfos before you enter metastasis and croak.

The 4-5 year terms of Anglo-American elections are not a bad timeframe for this kind of grift. Reaganomics can produce a stock-market sugar rush and hectic roses on the economy's cheeks in that period, and then Ronny can toddle off to count his polyps before the bill is due.

Some gators, though, have faster-than-average reflexes and can turn and take a leg before you can move on. Coronavirus, with its 3-week crisis cycles, is among the most intensely anti-grift adversaries that chancers like Trump and Bojo could encounter.

"Everything's fine! Get drunk in an enclosed space while desperate, precarious, racialized people sharpen your fingernails and groom your fur! It will be fine!"

[3 weeks pass]

"Uh, we've always been pro-mask. Why the fuck are you in that bar? Personal responsibility!"

The chancers have fed our lungs and our economy to the gators, by refusing to lock down and refusing to fund a stay-at-home order. Now, they're trying to figure out how to distract us from the sight of all those gators masticating our severed legs.

Bojo's idea? A "New Deal."

That was FDR's plan to revitalize the economy after the Great Depression through extensive public spending that offered meaningful employment in the caring and infrastructure sectors, with generous arts and scholarship spending.

Which would be pretty amazing! But Bojo's Made-in-Britain New Deal is just another grift.

FDR's New Deal accounted for &lt;em&gt;forty percent US GDP&lt;/em&gt;.

Boris's proposed spend is 0.2%.

Zero. Point. Two. Percent.

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/boris-johnsons-new-deal-is-roosevelt-lite"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/boris-johnsons-new-deal-is-roosevelt-lite&lt;/a&gt;

Grifters like to surround themselves with other grifters. Reagan had Nancy's astrologer. Boris has Dominic "Typhoid Dom" Cummings, who has his own back to the future plan: a Made-in-Britain ARPA (the US agency that created the internet, GPS, etc).

This is how ARPA worked:

&lt;a href="https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw"&gt;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw&lt;/a&gt;

A kind of autonomous, excellence-focused institution where advancement was based on skill, not aristocratic birth.

It's impossible to imagine such an institution emerging from a Tory regime. The posh boys would fill the agency with inbred double-hairs in need of cushy resume-padding and an expense account. It wouldn't produce a new internet - it would produce a massive bar-tab and a long tail of sexual harassment claims.

&lt;h1&gt;The real racial wealth gap (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/05/pluralistic-05-jul-2020/#class-war"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

America has a serious racial wealth-gap problem. The mean net worth of white US households is $900,600; the mean net worth of Black US households is $140,000.

But as Matt Bruenig writes, averages are deceiving.

&lt;a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/07/racial-wealth-gap-redistribution/"&gt;https://jacobinmag.com/2020/07/racial-wealth-gap-redistribution/&lt;/a&gt;

That's because America &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; has a serious inequality problem. Almost all the wealth in America is controlled by the richest 10% of households (those households are overwhelmingly white, ofc, but also the richest 10% of Black households account for nearly all Black wealth).

"What this means is that the overall racial wealth disparity is being driven almost entirely by the disparity between the wealthiest 10 percent of white people and the wealthiest 10 percent of black people."

In other words, if you made the average Black US household as rich as the average white US household, but left the gap between the richest Black and white people intact, it would hardly make a dent in the gap between white and Black wealth.

"97 percent of the overall racial wealth gap is driven by households above the median of each racial group."

We could eliminate almost all of the wealth gap by making the richest Black people as rich as the richest white people - which would no nothing for nearly everyone.

Or we could fix it by leveling the bottom 90% of Black households up to the same net worth of the bottom 90% of white households, which would still leave both groups in desperate precarity.

Bruenig: "The way through this bind is, of course, to acknowledge that racial capitalism has concentrated almost all of the national wealth in the hands of a small number of white families. The proper course of action is to redistribute that wealth to the multiracial lower and working classes, tackling both racial and class inequality simultaneously."

&lt;h1&gt;Grace is going home (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/01/set-healthy-boundaries/#grace-freed"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

A Black Michigan teen with ADHD who was imprisoned for not doing her homework during the lockdown has been ordered released to her mother, after months of incarceration.

&lt;a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2020/07/31/oakland-co-girl-jailed-not-doing-homework-ordered-release/5557997002/"&gt;https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2020/07/31/oakland-co-girl-jailed-not-doing-homework-ordered-release/5557997002/&lt;/a&gt;

Grace was on parole for briefly stealing a classmate's phone; Mary Ellen Brennan (a judge facing reelection this year) decided missing homework constituted a serious enough parole violation that it warranted a long term custodial sentence.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/15/3-frauds-in-a-trenchcoat/#judge-mary-ellen-brennan"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/15/3-frauds-in-a-trenchcoat/#judge-mary-ellen-brennan&lt;/a&gt;

Grace was imprisoned after an in-person hearing that her defense counsel deemed too dangerous to attend in person. Brennan held the hearing anyway, then, after public outcry, held a second hearing at which she affirmed her decision to imprison Grace.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/21/the-thief-of-joy/#grace"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/21/the-thief-of-joy/#grace&lt;/a&gt;

Brennan's rationale for Grace's imprisonment was that the juvenile facility would help her get the education she was missing at home and also help resolve her friction with her mother.

Brennan maintained this despite testimony from Grace's teachers and school board officials, and despite the factual record: Grace's prison education consisted of filling in photocopied worksheets; her counseling amounted to a few minutes per week of videoconferencing.

Many Michigan members of Congress and other elected officials urged Brennan to reconsider, as did the local prosecutor. Hundreds of local students marched in support of Grace.

Today, the appeals court ordered Grace released into her mother's custody "pending appeal or further order of this court." She will be confined to home and tethered to a GPS cuff.

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/grace-black-teen-jailed-for-not-doing-her-online-coursework-is-released"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/grace-black-teen-jailed-for-not-doing-her-online-coursework-is-released&lt;/a&gt;

Brennan is up for re-election in a few months. She ran unopposed in her last election.

She is a garbage person.

&lt;h1&gt;A deep dive into Mexico's new copyright law (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/01/set-healthy-boundaries/#la-ley"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

For the past ten days, I've written extensively about Mexico's new copyright law, a law that copy-pastes the US copyright system, enacted with no consultation or debate, nominally to satisfy requirements under Donald Trump's USMCA agreement.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy&lt;/a&gt;

The law is a disaster for human rights, undermining free speech, the rights of disabled people, cybersecurity, national sovereignty, the Right to Repair, and other fundamental rights - it puts Mexico at a permanent, structural disadvantage relative to Canada and the US.

Like the US law it copies, the new law has numerous, seemingly reasonable exemptions that, superficially at least, appear to resolve these human rights issues. However, these are tissue-thin pretenses, unusably larded with conditions no one could satisfy.

We know this, because the US law they're copied from has been in place for 22 years, and in that time, &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; has been able to invoke these exemptions successfully. They are needles designed to be unthreadable, even by the most innocent and blameless of defendants.

My colleague, EFF Senior Attorney April Walsh, knows more about US copyright law and digital rights than almost anyone else in the world, and she has published a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; detailed analysis of the new Mexican law, drawing on her vast knowledge.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legal-deep-dive-mexicos-disastrous-new-copyright-law"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legal-deep-dive-mexicos-disastrous-new-copyright-law&lt;/a&gt;

This deep dive represents not just the first public translation of the law into English, but also the best, closest analysis of the law to date (her analysis is currently in translation and will be published soon, likely today).

Today is the final day for Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights to take action on the law, and if you are Mexican or in Mexico, you can petition them to take it up:

&lt;a href="https://participa.nicensuranicandados.org/"&gt;https://participa.nicensuranicandados.org/&lt;/a&gt;

But even if the Commission fails to act, the fight isn't over. As the people and businesses of Mexico have awakened to the hidden dangers of this law, pressure is growing for Congress to revisit it, and court cases are being planned.

If there was ever any doubt that digital rights were inseparable from human rights, surely the pandemic - which relegated our whole lives to the digital realm - has erased it. Organizations like R3D and Derechos Digital are leading the fight in Mexico.

Mexico's lawmakers have a duty to put their people's human rights ahead of the greed and venality of US-based multinationals. This issue will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go away.

&lt;h1&gt;The Tree Who Set Healthy Boundaries (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/01/set-healthy-boundaries/#boundaries"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Shel Silverstein was a hell of a writer. I mean, I thought so even before George RR Martin told me about "Uncle Shelby's ABZs" - a fantastically rude and incredible hilarious parody of a kid's book.

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/09/28/shel-silversteins-filthy-not.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2016/09/28/shel-silversteins-filthy-not.html&lt;/a&gt;

One of the marks of a great writer is that they can sell terrible things so well that you don't even notice that you're buying them. Take "The Giving Tree," a Silverstein book that should be a cautionary tale but is generally read as a suggestion.

In "The Tree Who Set Healthy Boundaries," Topher Payne rewrites the ending of "Giving Tree" to unpick the expert, Silversteinien knot of shitty ideas tied so well that you can easily miss them.

&lt;a href="https://www.topherpayne.com/giving-tree"&gt;https://www.topherpayne.com/giving-tree&lt;/a&gt;

Not only is this hilarious stuff, it's also incredibly, &lt;em&gt;viscerally&lt;/em&gt; satisfying, as the tree tells off the boy for being such a colossal asshole.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/91bb14_a363ecc27a1a4c3fa2df8f2b2da0fe77~mv2.jpg"/&gt;

And Payne brings it in for a hell of a landing!

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/91bb14_cabb266edaa44745a850327a4eff747b~mv2.jpg"/&gt;

It's also as strong an argument as you could ask for in favor of fair use, and the presumption that critical remix is - and always should be - fair use. Thankfully, this is a principle that the US Supreme Court has upheld.

&lt;a name="healthy-populism"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/populist-ticket-1024x602.jpeg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Populism is good for your health (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/01/set-healthy-boundaries/#healthy-populism"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Back in 2016, Thomas Frank_'s "Listen, Liberal!" forcefully explained that "liberals" are not leftists, and that while we on the left might sometimes ally with liberals, we are not on the same side.

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781627795395"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781627795395&lt;/a&gt;

This is something that most of the world outside of the USA knows, but the USA has largely forgotten. I'll never forget my first day of university in the US, when a classmate told me I had "liberal" views; having grown up in Canada's NDP, I knew the difference!

In the US, this manifests as excessive credit for Donald Trump - AKA excessive blame for Donald Trump - as though he was bright enough and had enough executive function to be a cause, rather than an effect.

If you're impressed by the Lincoln Project - a collection of war criminals and grifters from the Reagan and GWB administration and former Romney campaign backers - you're probably a liberal.

If you think that those guys should be dragged in front of an American Nuremberg Trial for their role in dirty wars and Forever Wars; mass incarceration, mass deportation and mass surveillance; financial fraud, torture and worse, you're probably a leftist.

The Lincoln Project doesn't object to Trump's most substantive policies - they just want them executed in ways that don't say the quiet part out loud - they don't care if the rich shit on the rest of us, they just abhor gold-plated toilets as unforgivably gauche.

Writing in Le Monde (and, tellingly, not in a US publication), Frank describes the role that America's dysfunctional, profiteering, world-trailing health care system played in the pandemic (recall that the DNC just voted &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; Medicare For All).

&lt;a href="https://mondediplo.com/2020/08/02populism-expertise"&gt;https://mondediplo.com/2020/08/02populism-expertise&lt;/a&gt;

Liberals didn't turn pandemic into a culture war with mask-refusal and astroturf "reopen" protests, but they legitimized it when they overweighted the role that the recklessness of GOP science-refusal played in the pandemic's spread --

-- and underweighted the role the broken health-care system played. My hometown of LA is not a hotbed of plague because of mask-refusal; the major spread events are in unsafe businesses where precarious workers can't afford health care and can't risk narcing on their boss.

Meanwhile, anti-science mask-refusers AND pro-universal-health-care activists (who are following the undeniable scientific conclusion that universal care is cheaper and better) are both lumped together as "populists" and dismissed by liberal and conservative establishments.

As Frank describes, the origins of American populism are in a decidedly pro-science movement: "Populists produced homages to technology and scholarship and education that were so earnest and ornate that they are embarrassing to read today."

These pops fought the establishment, who leaned on pseudoscience to declare the status quo as ordained by the inevitable forces of "scientific economics," which decreed that only the "best" people could hope for a decent life.

By the 1930s, health care was a flashpoint for populism. Frank tells the story of the medical co-op of Elk City, OK,  "in which farm families would pay a modest sum each year for guaranteed access to doctors, dentists and a modern regional hospital."

Elk Point was fought tooth-and-nail by the AMA, which declared war on the co-op's doctor, the socialist Lebanese immigrant Michael Shadid, who called himself a "Doctor for the People" and believed that health care part of America's bulwark against dictatorship.

The AMA tried to revoke Shadid's license, excluded him from AMA membership (and thus malpractice insurance) and warned other doctors that they'd be blackballed if they went to work with him.

As Frank says, this was not a "popular war on science" - it was "science's war on populism." That is, the ruling class, having cloaked itself in "scientific economics" declared those who upheld more durable (and urgent) scientific truths public enemies and waged war on them.

The AMA - whose wealthy members were certainly part of the ruling class - boycotted orgs that researched "medical economics," threatened reprisals against doctors who tried to repeat the Elk Point experiment, and denounced any Congressional investigations of these tactics.

When a federal inquiry into the AMA's anti-co-op activity convened in 1938, AMA's president rejected it: "That is not scientific medicine and that is not scientific economics."

As Frank says, the AMA's position was that government oversight was "a perversion of the social hierarchy, with the laity demanding some quack remedy and bawling that the experts must prescribe it to him."

And when Truman won in 1948 on a promise of universal healthcare, the AMA called such care the "discredited system of decadent nations" and raised a special warchest from its wealthy members to pay the pioneering Campaigns, Inc to run a propaganda campaign against it.

When Canada's CCF - precursor to the NDP - created the first medicare system in Saskatchewan in 62, doctors walked off the job en masse, and SK doctors raised their own warchest to fight universal access to care.

They were backed by a suspicious, far-right org called "Keep Our Doctors" that appeared out of nowhere and fought medicare "by means of public demonstrations, red-baiting, and racist innuendo."

Thomas holds this up as an example of a "democracy scare": "in which society’s high-status groups come to believe that their privileges have been placed in mortal danger by the actions of the vast, seething multitude."

Democracy scares have popped up whenever left populism arose in America, from William Jennings Bryan to FDR. What was at stake wasn't science, it was privilege: the conversion of health-care from an industry that enriched its backers to a human right.

Opponents of Saskatechewan's medical system called it "a battle for the professional men in this era of mobocracy," and warned that we were moving from a world where everyone knew their place to a world who's motto was "I'm as good as you are."

Populism was leftist. As Steven Brust explained to me, all you need to ask to cleave left from right is: "What's more important: human rights or property rights?" Anyone who says, "property rights are human rights" is not on the left (I used this in Walkaway).

Or as Corey Robin says in The Reactionary Mind, the unifier of all rightwing schools of thought - from eugenics to dominionism to imperialism to libertarianism - is the belief that some people are innately better than others, and they should rule.

&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001"&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001&lt;/a&gt;

Democrats are not a leftists. Frank: they're "the bought-and-paid-for vehicle of affluent and highly educated professionals. It dutifully bails out the geniuses on Wall Street. It responsibly obeys the economists who tell us about the wonders of ‘free trade.’"

"And when our modern Democrats propose healthcare reform, they do it from the top down, by convening experts from every affected field and asking them to redraw the system amongst themselves — and then are astonished when the public erupts in outrage."

Today, private-equity backed, highly concentrated hospital chains and pharma companies have taken over the AMA's role in fighting universal healthcare, and the Dem establishment dismisses M4A advocates as "populists" and lumps them in with Trump-addled mask-deniers.

This ideology locates the world's problems in the unruliness of The People: "Democracy is a problem, they tell us, because democracy allows the common people to ignore the authority of expertise. Disobedient democracy is to blame for Trump."

"Disobedient democracy is why we can do nothing about global warming. Disobedient democracy is the reason we can’t beat the Covid pandemic. And all of it is the fault of We the People."

But The People aren't the reason that we don't have universal testing, that we haven't hired an army of contact tracers, that workers fear reprisals if they reveal their unsafe working conditions, which breed and spread pandemic.

We The People aren't why we don't have universal healthcare, they're not why we aren't paying people to stay home or stemming the tide of evictions. The policies that created the pandemic disaster aren't Trumpist aberrations, they're mainstream Republicanism.

They're the Republicanism of the Lincoln Project, which supported consolidation in pharma and healthcare, erosion of workers' rights and health and safety regulation.

And they're the policies of the mainstream of the Democrats, too: the brutal austerity of Pelosi's Paygo and Brooker's votes against taming the pharma industry.

Trump's criminal, lethal mismanagement of the pandemic would have slaughtered Americans by the tens of thousands regardless of this, of course - but hundreds of thousands more would have been spared infection, eviction and death if it wasn't for the system he presides over.

He didn't make that system, and the professionalized, elite-worshipping DNC won't unmake it. As Frank says, "In our awful current situation, a dose of authentic populism would be a remarkable tonic."

&lt;h1&gt;Commercial real-estate's looming collapse (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/09/just-dont-have-a-face/#systemic-risk"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Commercial real estate is in &lt;em&gt;biiiig&lt;/em&gt; trouble. Malls - already under threat before the plague - will be full of empty storefronts. Offices, oy. They'll lose tenants when their businesses collapse. Surviving tenants will take advantage of higher vacancies to negotiate lower rates.

Those tenants won't need as much space anyway: between layoffs and mass, permanent work-from-home (which will let employers seek the cheapest labor, anywhere in the world), demand is gonna fall &lt;em&gt;off a cliff&lt;/em&gt;.

That's really really bad news, because commercial real-estate is super leveraged thanks to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), the favored vehicle of overseas money-launderers seeking to clean their corrupt gains, as CZ Edwards explained last year.

&lt;a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1213597148274511872.html"&gt;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1213597148274511872.html&lt;/a&gt;

The REITs borrowed titanic sums on grossly overinflated valuations based on absurdly optimistic occupancy projections. As Randall Head explains in a post on Dave Farber's Interesting People list, this leaves their creditors - the banks - vastly exposed.

&lt;a href="https://ip.topicbox.com/groups/ip/T3811dde3cf47e0ed/coming-next-the-greater-recession"&gt;https://ip.topicbox.com/groups/ip/T3811dde3cf47e0ed/coming-next-the-greater-recession&lt;/a&gt;

Here's the bottom line: "A middling-sized bank which in Jan had twenty billion dollars of commercial loans, secured by liens against $25B of office towers and shopping malls now has twenty billion dollars of commercial loans secured by liens against $18B of real property."

That $25b valuation was based on the assumption of 80% occupancy. After the Comet Covid's extinction-level event (exacerbated by gross mishandling, from epidemiological ineptitude to deficitphobic austerity), $18b is generous.

Banks that loaned to plutes cleaning money for crooks? Dead. They'll need bailouts, nationalization, or wreaths.

Head: "If you thought it was fun bailing out the FSLIC, you're gonna LOVE bailing out the FDIC, especially when every other economy is bailing out its banks."

&lt;h1&gt;Test-proctoring software worsens systemic bias (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/09/just-dont-have-a-face/#algorithmic-bias"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

On the one hand, high-stakes testing is pedagogically bankrupt, but on the other hand, it sure produces numbers that universities can focus on increasing, and then trumpet when those numbers are higher than they used to be. I guess that's important?

The problems with high-stakes testing were magnified by lockdown, with universities demanding that students infect their computers - often shared with family members - with spyware that claimed to perform "invigilation" (anti-cheating surveillance).

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/15/invigilation/#invigilation"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/15/invigilation/#invigilation&lt;/a&gt;

Having decided that invigilation software was easier than finding a way to evaluate students without useless high-stakes tests, universites began a campaign of cruel bullying to crush student opposition.

At Wilfrid Laurier in Ontario, computer science students were required to purchase webcams that were not available to sale, on pain of flunking.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/13/malwaretech/#unobtanium"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/13/malwaretech/#unobtanium&lt;/a&gt;

And when students around the world complained about the problems with invigilation tools, the CEOs of these massively profitable ed-tech profiteers did what any responsible exec would do: they doxxed their underaged critics.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/01/bossware/#moral-exemplar"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/01/bossware/#moral-exemplar&lt;/a&gt;

Writing in MIT Tech Review, Shea Swauger describes the disproportionate impact that invigilation software has on marginalized students, especially Black and trans students and students who are parenting young kids from home.

&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/07/1006132/software-algorithms-proctoring-online-tests-ai-ethics/"&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/07/1006132/software-algorithms-proctoring-online-tests-ai-ethics/&lt;/a&gt;

For starters, the facial recognition software has the well-understood algorithmic racial bias thanks to deficits in training data.

That means that when Black students sit their exams, the tools demand that they increase the lighting to aid in facial verification, and often reject them outright, so they can't sit the exam at all.

Similar problems occur for trans students who are transitioning, whose faces are no longer recognizable by the facial recognition system.

Meanwhile, the systems' unblinking eyes are incapable of distinguishing between students who are cheating by having a confederate in the room and students with young kids being interrupted as they sit their exams.

Likewise, they can't tell the difference between someone who gets up to cheat and someone who gets up because they have a medical condition that requires them to take frequent toilet breaks.

Creepily, the tools require students to pan the camera around their living spaces for "room checks," and then let their profs download and view these images of intimate living quarters, including any family members who have nowhere else to go.

These are important considerations, and there's an equally important principle lurking behind the surface, which is that the problem isn't merely that the algorithm is racist or that the tool discriminates against marginalized students.

The fact that facial recognition struggles with Black faces is the result of a training data deficit, which can be easily fixed, by feeding the algorithm LOTS of Black faces to chew through.

That's what Chinese quasi-state surveillance companies did, using Zimbabwe's driver's license database to perfect its ability to recognize Black faces.

&lt;a href="https://qz.com/africa/1287675/china-is-exporting-facial-recognition-to-africa-ensuring-ai-dominance-through-diversity/"&gt;https://qz.com/africa/1287675/china-is-exporting-facial-recognition-to-africa-ensuring-ai-dominance-through-diversity/&lt;/a&gt;

That means that China - and repressive regimes elsewhere that buy Chinese surveillance tools - can spy on Black people really accurately.

This is not an improvement.

And as to high-stakes testing: it's a fool's errand, completely uncoupled from real-world knowledge work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; any pretense of rigorous pedagogical assessment.

Even if we found a way to do high-stakes testing without victimizing Black, trans, poor, and parenting students, it would still be garbage.

&lt;h1&gt;My origin story (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/13/better-to-have-loved/#neofuturians"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When people ask me how I became an sf writer in the hopes of following in my footsteps, I've got bad news for them: I became an sf writer thanks to an utterly unique set of extremely beneficial circumstances that have never been replicated, and more's the pity.

Let's start with Judith Merril, the eminent sf writer, critic and editor. After the Chicago police riots in 1968, Judy went into voluntarily exile in Toronto, taking her daughters and her books - the collection she'd amassed with her ex-husband Fred Pohl - with her.

Judy was a political radical who was core to both the Rochdale Free College and Seed Alternative School - radical educational programs that had a seismic effect on Canadian culture.

She also got work on TV: for years, she hosted Doctor Who on TVO, Ontario's public broadcaster. Before every episode, she'd come on and talk about the tropes in it, where their origins were in sf history, often recounting personal stories about the writers who invented them.

I grew up on these intros: my mom went to teacher's college at night and my dad and brother and I would stay home and watch Doctor Who and Judy, who my dad knew from radical politics.

Very little of that old Judy tape survives, but there is some!

&lt;a href="http://www.retrontario.com/2014/02/02/tvontario-judith-merril-the-undoctor-1980-2/"&gt;http://www.retrontario.com/2014/02/02/tvontario-judith-merril-the-undoctor-1980-2/&lt;/a&gt;

Judy donated her and Fred's book collection to the Toronto Public Library system and founded a library she called "The Spaced Out Library" that is now the largest public sf reference collection in the world.

6It's now called the Merril Collection; Judy wouldn't let them change the name until she died. I visited the Merril the first time when I was 9 and met Judy in person, instantly recognizing her from TVO. She told us that we could bring stories to her and she'd help with them.

When the plague is over, you should visit the Merril and ask to see their guest book - here's a page my class signed around 1981, including Tim "Timmy" Wu.

&lt;a href="https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/merril/"&gt;https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/merril/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/4671462460_f6feae9a48_c.jpg"/&gt;

Over the years, I started taking the subway down to the Spaced Out and getting my stories critiqued.

And after, I'd always visit Bakka Books, the oldest sf bookstore on Earth.

I started visiting Bakka with school around the same time as the Merril. On my first visit, a young woman who was trying to sell her first story named Tanya Huff was working behind the counter.

Tanya asked me what kind of books I liked, and took me to the used section and put a $1 copy of H Beam Piper's Little Fuzzy in my hands. It was the first book I ever bought with my own money!

Tanya became a mentor, too: when Judy was busy, I'd sometimes bring her stories to critique. She was INCREDIBLY patient. And when she started selling enough books to quit her job and write full time, I got her job.

Working at Bakka and selling a few stories meant that I could start going to Toronto Hydra parties, the regular movable feast the Judy established based on the huge potluck dinners that NYC's legendary Futurian House used to throw.

The Futurians were denied entry to the first Worldcon banquet for being leftists - my kind of sf writers! These parties included the librarians from the Merril, writers, critics, editors, artists, and the crew of TVO's sf show Prisoners of Gravity.

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_Gravity"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_Gravity&lt;/a&gt;

And even as I was going to those parties, working at Bakka and selling stories, I was also still attending the writers' workshop at Seed Alternative School, which Judy had founded more than a decade before, and which attracted students from all over the city.

While also workshopping with the likes of Karl Schroeder and David Nickle at the Cecil Street Irregulars, &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; workshop Judy founded, made up of some of the writers who'd brought her stories at the Spaced Out.

I was also reading Tesseracts - Judy's anthology series of Canadian sf - and then went on to co-edit a volume, with Holly Phillips. (I got to publish Madeline Ashby's first story!).

Really, it was an &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; time to be an aspiring sf writer, and so much of it boiled down to Judy's tireless energy for connecting and mentoring people and setting up institutions that outlived her.

I do my best to pay it forward. I teach Clarion or Clarion West every year or two, I volunteer on the board of the Toronto Public Library Foundation, which raises money for the Merril (tax deductible in the US and Canada!) and I try to mentor writers, too.

And I try to tell as much of Judy's story as I know. But of course, Judy tells it better than me. Her Hugo-award winning memoir, Better to Have Loved (written with her granddaughter @emilypohlweary) is a must-read:

&lt;a href="https://btlbooks.com/book/better-to-have-loved"&gt;https://btlbooks.com/book/better-to-have-loved&lt;/a&gt;

And I bring all of this up now because this Saturday, I'm being inducted into the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/31/hall-of-famer/#hall-of-famer"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/31/hall-of-famer/#hall-of-famer&lt;/a&gt;

And so many of the past inductees are the people who mentored me: Judy Merril, Tanya Huff, Lorna Toolis (former head librarian of the Merril).

As well as writers like William Gibson, Spider Robinson, Phyllis Gottleib, Charles de Lint, Elizabeth Vonarburg and others who were so important to my own artistic formation.

The Hall of Fame presentations are part of the Prix Aurora Awards, which livestream on Saturday from 4PM Pacific on. You can tune in here:

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt8FHApN40c"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt8FHApN40c&lt;/a&gt;

I'm going to say all this stuff again, but I might cry a little while saying it. Be warned.

&lt;h1&gt;Sudowrite (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/13/better-to-have-loved/#novel-writing-machine"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

For the past couple weeks, I've been playing around with Sudowrite, Amit Gupta and friends' GPT3-based text generator for fiction writers. You give it it characters, plot summaries, dialogue or twist endings.

&lt;a href="https://www.sudowrite.com/"&gt;https://www.sudowrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;

You can feed it part of a paragraph and it'll autocomplete it, and you can set a "vibe" for the autocomplete: Neutral, Extraordinary, Ominous and Funny.

For example, some dialog autocomplete. Here's my prompt:

"The following is a conversation between Masha and Marcus, who are arguing about whether programmer have a moral duty to ensure their code does not contribute to human rights abuses.

"Masha: It's so easy to say that you should only work for good if you are a bro who can waltz into a job.

"Marcus: Come on, who do you think is most likely to be on the receiving end of cyberwarfare? Hint: it's not wealthy white dudes who get hit with stalkerware or lawful interception code."

Here's what Sudowrite adds:

Masha: Sure, the privileged are the first targets for the digital equivalent of fire and brimstone. But even you have to admit that there are plenty of people who get hurt by our code every day.

Marcus: What's your point? I don't see what's controversial about that.

Masha: I'm not saying that people shouldn't fix bugs. But who are we to determine what constitutes a fix? When a programmer writes code that is responsible for cyberwarfare, or perpetuates rape culture, she's also part of that process.

Masha: And when you're part of something that's broken, your choice is to fix it or you're part of the problem.

Marcus: I don't have to agree with what someone's personal agenda is, but I think most people can agree that you should help when you can.

Masha: I'm not talking about altruism.

Marcus: You sound like an actual commie now.

Masha: Lok, it's true that the general assumption is that all we should do is code and shut up. But what if there's a chance that that's a social pathology that we can correct?

Marcus: Wow

[Me again]

This is pretty impressive. So far, Sudowrite hasn't helped me write anything, but I keep coming back to it, because this kind of machine language stuff is fascinating to see.

Sudowrite's now open for public testing - there's a form on the site you can fill in to apply to get into the test.

&lt;a href="https://www.sudowrite.com/"&gt;https://www.sudowrite.com/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Tear_Gas_Umbrella_Man_20140928.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;"Less lethal" is a euphemism, too (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/13/better-to-have-loved/#less-lethals"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

I remember when we stopped calling police weapons "nonlethal" and switched to "less lethal" - I thought it was a victory for anti-authoritarian realism, ditching a polite euphemism for a more accurate phrase that reminded us that the cops kill and mail people with these arms.

But after reading what Anna Feigenbaum says about the history of these weapons, I'm coming to think that "less lethal" is, itself, a euphemism. Feigenbaum is the author of 2017's "Tear Gas: From the Battlefields of World War I to the Streets of Today."

&lt;a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2109-tear-gas"&gt;https://www.versobooks.com/books/2109-tear-gas&lt;/a&gt;

Feigenbaum's comments appear in Oscar Schwartz's piece in The Guardian chronicling the sickening injuries experienced by BLM and pipeline protesters who were targeted by police wielding these weapons.

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/12/george-floyd-protests-lingering-trauma-non-lethal-weapons-scars"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/12/george-floyd-protests-lingering-trauma-non-lethal-weapons-scars&lt;/a&gt;

Schwartz reminds us that the origin of "less-lethals" is in colonial policing: occupying British troops used "baton rounds" (sections of broomstick fired from guns) to terrorize pro-independence protesters in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Cops transitioned to rubber bullets in Northern Ireland in the Troubles, insisting that these were humane even as they slaughtered and maimed protesters, including young children. Gas and baton rounds were the weapons of choice against anti-Vietnam War protests in the US.

There's a straight line from then to now and the gas cannisters, rubber bullets, beanbags, flashbangs and pepper balls we've seen fired into protesters' lines by masked and armored cops LARPing remorseless Judge Dredds.

Feigenbaum: "These weapons were invented as a way to not have to engage with people’s claims to human rights. And they are still deployed to both physically and psychologically destroy people engaging in resistance."

These weapons are big business, and the industry has a slick patter: "a narrative that emphasizes police vulnerability and underplays how dangerous the weapons really are...Officers feel it is reasonable and relatively safe for them to deploy any amount of force on people."

Inevitably, this leads to maimings and deaths, which begets a standard response: PD's say the problem is individual officers who fail to follow rules of deployment. Arms dealers insist that "if their products were used as instructed, serious injury would be avoided."

Schwartz's profiles of protesters who've been permanently injured by these weapons are harrowing, personal stories of PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, and permanent disability, but as he points out, the effects are community wide.

He cites this study of survivors of the Hong Kong uprisings who experienced a 500% increase in PTSD symptoms after witnessing brutal police violence abetted by police weaponry.

&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33160-5/fulltext"&gt;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33160-5/fulltext&lt;/a&gt;

In the US, everyone from Congress to the American Academy of Ophthalmology are begging cops to stop shooting and gassing protesters. But this isn't just authoritarianism: it's authoritarianism with a business model.

I think we've got a lot of bad times ahead of us before we achieve the structural reforms that drive the profiteers out of business, and in the meantime, they'll be deploying their excess rents - the wages of terror - to fight us.

&lt;h1&gt;Florida sheriff bans masks (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/13/better-to-have-loved/#death-cult"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Florida's in big pandemic trouble, thanks to the GOP death-cult that made epidemiology into a culture-war issue. And while many everyday Floridians have some weird ideas about the politics of pandemics, it's Florida officaldom that's at the heart of the problem.

Case in point: Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods has banned his deputies from wearing masks on the job, and has announced that he will not enforce the Ocala City Council's mandatory mask order.

&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/12/masks-florida-ban-billy-woods/"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/12/masks-florida-ban-billy-woods/&lt;/a&gt;

Woods emailed the Sheriff's Department to say, "The fact is, the amount of professionals that give the reason why we should [wear masks], I can find the exact same amount of professionals that say why we shouldn’t."

This is true in the sense that for every expert who will assert that the Earth is round, you can find an "expert" who'll tell you it is flat. The dispute isn't so much about facts as it is about epistemology: how do you know which experts are reliable?

Deputies working special events are banned from masking up. Woods requires all visitors to the Sheriff's Office to remove their masks as a condition of entry, in case they are antifa super-soldiers using masks as disguises.

200+ inmates in the local jail have tested positive, along with 36 jail employees. A jail nurse died of covd.

Wood: "This is no longer a debate nor is it up for discussion...My orders will be followed or my actions will be swift to address."

&lt;h1&gt;Post Paladin (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/17/aura-of-benevolence/#abot-their-duty"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When Trump's millionaire crony Louis DeJoy was appointed postmaster general and began vigorously dismantling the US Postal Service, we could only speculate about the underlying reasoning: was it all a plot to suppress postal voting?

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/12/failed-state/#machine-breakers"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/12/failed-state/#machine-breakers&lt;/a&gt;

Of course, Trump can't keep it in his pants literally or figuratively, so he quickly erased all doubt by announcing that destroying Benjamin Franklin's postal service was all part of a plot to steal the election.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-postal-service-mail-voting.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-postal-service-mail-voting.html&lt;/a&gt;

As we scramble to save the US mail, roleplayers can work out some frustration with Ashton Duncan's new character class, the Post Paladin.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashtonnduncan/status/1295116932581072897"&gt;https://twitter.com/ashtonnduncan/status/1295116932581072897&lt;/a&gt;

Your paladin becomes a Post Paladin by reciting the Oath of the Post:

Messenger of Sympathy and Love 
Servant of Parted Friends 
Consoler of the Lonely 
Bond of the Scattered Family 
Enlarger of the Common Life

Carrier of News and Knowledge
Instrument of Trade and Industry 
Promoter of Mutual Acquaintance 
Of Peace and of Goodwill Among Men and Nations.

(also inscribed on the cornerstone of the Smithsonian's Postal Museum)

You get spells:

5th level: animal messenger, skywrite
13h level: freedom of movement, locate creature

And two channel divinity options:

I. Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor... (weather control)

II. Deliver Deliverance (travel unimpeded)

Starting at Level 7, you get the Aura of Haste, which lets you and your animal companions travel faster.

At 20th level, you become Postmaster General, which includes wings and a 30m aura of benevolence.

&lt;h1&gt;Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/17/aura-of-benevolence/#sctt-slt"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

I just posted the latest episode of my podcast: it's the 13th installment of my longrunning reading of my 2006 novel Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town, a book Gene Wolfe called "a glorious book unlike any book you've ever read."

&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/podcast/2020/08/16/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town-part-13/"&gt;https://craphound.com/podcast/2020/08/16/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town-part-13/&lt;/a&gt;

This is one of my favorite parts of the book! A lightly fictionalized account of the worst internet access of my life: trying to get wifi from Swisscom while attending a Geneva UN meeting for EFF in 2003, an experience that is still darkly comic all these years later.

Here's the MP3 of the episode:

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/h1bDetroit_Wayne_County_Airport_US_Customs.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;No one wants an H1B visa (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/17/aura-of-benevolence/#crickets"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Despite the potential for labor exploitation, the H1B visa highly prized by skilled workers hoping to come to the USA (skilled workers being precisely the sort that Trump and Bannon promised to preferentially admit to the country).

H1B demand is so high that the US Customs and Immigration Service holds an annual lottery to decide who will get one.

This year, for the first time ever, the lotto was so undersubscribed that they had to hold a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; lottery to find enough people willing to work in the US.

&lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/14/h1b_second_lottery/"&gt;https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/14/h1b_second_lottery/&lt;/a&gt;

While 275,000 people applied for lotto admission in April, so few of those people followed through with documentation that the lotto's quota of 85,000 H1B visa went begging.

US anti-immigration bigots insist that they're not opposed to immigration per se, they just want to ensure that those who come to the US follow the rules and "do it right." But the Trump admin has made the rules literally impossible to follow.

For example, say you've attained a Green Card, something that many people only get after literally &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt; of paperwork filing and patient waiting. Green Card holders are supposed to carry around their cards with them.

But the US government is no longer issuing the cards, having allowed its contract with the company that prints them to expire in June.

&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-the-trump-administration-is-turning-legal-immigrants-into-undocumented-ones/2020/07/09/15c1cbf6-c203-11ea-9fdd-b7ac6b051dc8_story.html"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-the-trump-administration-is-turning-legal-immigrants-into-undocumented-ones/2020/07/09/15c1cbf6-c203-11ea-9fdd-b7ac6b051dc8_story.html&lt;/a&gt;

This means that legal immigrants who have gone through the most stringent, protracted, expensive and intensive process to gain the legal right to reside in the USA are now literally undocumented immigrants, out of compliance with the rules they must follow.

There's a backlog of 50,000 Green Cards and 75,000 other visa documents for legal immigrants to the USA. Some of those documents are for people who've lived in the US for decades, dutifully renewing their visas when they expired.

One important note: when you get a visa or a Green Card, you pay very high filing fees, and included in those fees is a line-item for the printing of your paperwork.

In other words, all those undocumented workers paid USCIS to print their papers, and the USCIS blew the money without delivering the goods.

&lt;h1&gt;Quantifying the meritocratic delusion (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/23/visionary-art/#meritocratic-delusion"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Our societal narratives are invisible by dint of their ubiquity, but they are far more important in stabilizing the status quo that all the cops and jails and domestic surveillance agencies put together.

Take inequality: when a few have much, and the many have little, the primary means of preventing the many from seizing the wealth of the few isn't burglar alarms - it's legitimacy.

If you can convince people that wealth is both earned and deserved, you can save a lot on armed guards, vaults and CCTV cameras.

The aristocracy once used the church to effect this legitimacy: as the English crown's motto goes, "Dieu et mon droit" ("God and my right").

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.jpg"/&gt;

The aristocratic legitimacy story makes it a literal sin to question inequality.

As the aristocracy gave way to merchant princes, society needed a new stabilizing story: the tale of the market, whose invisible hand allocates capital to the most deserving.

It's a highly circular form of reasoning, of course: "I am deserving because I am rich; I am rich because I am deserving."

Naturally, this self-serving logic attracted ridicule.

Notably, the sociologist Michael Young wrote a satirical, dystopian novel mocking this idea called "The Rise of the Meritocracy."

His coinage, "Meritocracy," was meant to deflate the delusion that wealth was merit and merit was wealth.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy_(1967_cover).jpg"/&gt;

Instead, the term was adopted by the very people it was meant to lampoon: soon, capitalism boosters and defenders of inequality began to proclaim themselves to be "meritocrats" and defended the institutions that had enriched them as "meritocratic." Yeah, it's weird.

At its core, "meritocracy" is eugenics: the belief that some people are just intrinsically better than others (that's why you often hear plutocrats boasting of their "good blood" - think of Trump here).

Sometimes it's dressed up with coded language like "self-control" or "grit," but ultimately, it's about some in-born spark that both demands that the meritocrat lead the rest of us, and that they be rewarded for it. You can tell who deserves to rule because they are ruling.

As with all eugenics stories, meritocracy is trivially disprovable pseudoscientific nonsense.

Stipulate for the sake of argument that there are "meritocratic" traits that some of us are born with.

One thing we know about hereditable traits is that they follow a normal distribution - a bell curve. If merit is a heritable trait, then it should follow that same distribution.

But recall that "merit" is the excuse given for inequality: the market is a system for uncovering and rewarding merit, matching quanta of merit with dollars in a precise ratio (Bill Gates's $114b and Jeff Bezos's $196b tells us that Gates possesses 58% of Bezos's merit).

And unfortunately for meritocracy's coherence, the actual wealth distribution follows a power-law curve, not a bell-curve. The zottarich are an order of magnitude richer than the gigarich, who are an order of magnitude richer than the ultrarich and so on.

Plutocracy is asymptotic to infinity.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Long_tail.svg.jpg"/&gt;

And while eugenics fails to account for this distribution there's another hypothesis that turns out to be a good fit: the rich are lucky.

Enter "Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure," a paper from a group of U Catatania researchers that proposes a model for explaining deepening inequality.

&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068"&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068&lt;/a&gt;

A breakdown in MIT Technology Review explains it well. The model assumes that N people have various talents "around some average level, with some standard deviation."

&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/01/144958/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich-turns-out-its-just-chance/?itm_source=parsely-api"&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/01/144958/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich-turns-out-its-just-chance/?itm_source=parsely-api&lt;/a&gt;

"The computer model charts each individual through a working life of 40 years. During this time, the individuals experience lucky events that they can exploit to increase their wealth if they are talented enough.

"However, they also experience unlucky events that reduce their wealth. These events occur at random."

After 40 simulated years, the agents in the simulation have a wealth distribution that looks a hell of a lot like ours.

They run the simulation repeatedly, and get the same distribution every time. In other words, markets allocate capital primarily by luck, not merit.

However, I'd like to see another version of this experiment that adds in immorality: a willingness to cheat and steal. Given the state of the plutocracy, I hypothesize an even stronger correlation.

&lt;h1&gt;AOC's WPA-style GND posters (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/23/visionary-art/#wpa-gnd"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

There's a lot going for AOC: she's a once-in-a-generation gifted orator, she's got a sharp political mind, she's got the humility and self-awareness to surround herself with other smart people and recruit them to advise her.

But even her most ardent admirers tend to overlook the role of graphic design in her work. From the start - her initial primary campaign - she has led the field with striking, beautiful graphic design. I framed one of her posters and hung it my house.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/29687015957_49490e9a62_h.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/29687015957/"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/29687015957/&lt;/a&gt;

AOC's latest graphic campaign is in support of the Green New Deal, a visionary proposal for a better future that has been sorely lacking in visual materials.

(The major exception being Molly Crabapple's animation in "A Message From the Future," an Intercept video with AOC and Naomi Klein).

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ&lt;/a&gt;

The new posters recall the WPA illustrations for the National Park Service, icons of design that retain remarkable currency nearly a century later.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/wpagc.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/works-progress-administration-posters/?fa=subject%3Anational+parks+%26+reserves"&gt;https://www.loc.gov/collections/works-progress-administration-posters/?fa=subject%3Anational+parks+%26+reserves&lt;/a&gt;

There are six in all. The first is Gavin Snider's Flushing Meadows poster, celebrating the 1939 New York World's Fair, a high water mark for hope in a moment of crisis.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/flushing_3afa961b-ecde-4170-b232-1490bb2a3817_1800x1800.png"/&gt;

Next is Scott Starrett's Pelham Bay Park poster, celebrating the Bronx's most iconic WPA success story, a beloved beach and golf course.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/pehlam_d017eb83-206e-4f60-aa73-b243f2c90d86_1800x1800.png"/&gt;

The third poster is Gavin Snider's tribute to LA's Griffith Observatory, the centerpiece of one of the country's exemplary, beloved and well-used city parks.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/griffith_9016ef73-d08f-4d61-a12c-78585269f737_1800x1800.png"/&gt;

&lt;a href="https://shop.ocasiocortez.com/collections/all/products/griffin-observatory-gnd-poster"&gt;https://shop.ocasiocortez.com/collections/all/products/griffin-observatory-gnd-poster&lt;/a&gt;

Fourth is Lazarus Nazario's poster celebrating the Plaza Del Totem in San Juan, Puerto Rico, a symbol of indigenous resilience erected as a rebuttal to the shameful celebration of the great historic monster Christopher Columbus.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/deltotum_7eac067b-7c5b-4c09-8913-80d62d66e4c1_1800x1800.png"/&gt;

Fifth is Gavin Snider's poster for Detroit's Hart Plaza, whose monument commemorates the Underground Railroad in one of America's great historically Black cities, a city that has been brutalized by white supremacy and austerity.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/hartplaza_60af5125-8694-43dc-880e-e0b002fdaafb_1800x1800.png"/&gt;

Finally, there's Dayi Tofu's commemoration of Boston's Public Garden, part of the city's "Emerald Necklace" of urban parks.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/publicgarden_ea48a057-d355-41b2-8dc0-bb5208f7388f_1800x1800.png"/&gt;

&lt;a href="https://shop.ocasiocortez.com/collections/all/products/the-public-garden-gnd-poster"&gt;https://shop.ocasiocortez.com/collections/all/products/the-public-garden-gnd-poster&lt;/a&gt;

The posters are a reminder that we are not the fallen remnants of a lost civilization, no longer capable of visionary collective projects to secure our future. We have done this before and we can do it again.

We are not atomized individuals, incapable of effecting change beyond the scope of what one person can do - or what one billionaire can coerce. We are a society, and we can steer our course.

The posters are union made, 18" x 12", and cost $24 each. You can get all six in a $90 bundle.

&lt;h1&gt;Doc resigns after his employer charges $11k for a $8 covid test (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/06/137300-pct-markup/#137300-pct-markup"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Zachary Sussman is a pathologist who oversaw covid tests at 4 standalone ERs for Physicians Premier, but he resigned in horror after he got a $8 covid test at one of the company's locations and then they billed his insurer $10,984.16 for it.

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-doctor-went-to-his-own-employer-for-a-covid-19-antibody-test-it-cost-10-984"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/a-doctor-went-to-his-own-employer-for-a-covid-19-antibody-test-it-cost-10-984&lt;/a&gt;

In an outstanding investigation for Propublica and the Texas Tribune, Marshall Allen reveals how both Physicians Premier and Unitedhealthcare - the nation's largest insurer - feed into this system of fraudulent price-gouging through a combination of greed and indifference.

There are elements of this that are just straight-up fraud: the coding on Sussman's bill includes charges for procedures that simply were not performed, like an antibody test, an in-depth investigation, a problem-focused history, a nasal swab, etc.

To make the fraud even more ghastly, Physicians Premier (and USA Emergency Centers, who license the name) overbilled for these procedures that were never performed: they charged $3200 for the nonextistent antibody test that they list at $75.

The vast majority ($8,884.16) came in the form of a "facility fee," a major source of emergency care grift that crops up whenever private equity funds get involved in emergency care.

When you hear about someone getting thousands in out-of-network fees for an icepack, that's almost always a "facility fee."

&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health-care/2018/12/18/18134825/emergency-room-bills-health-care-costs-america"&gt;https://www.vox.com/health-care/2018/12/18/18134825/emergency-room-bills-health-care-costs-america&lt;/a&gt;

In this case, the fraud and facility fee were compounded by the fact that Physicians Premier/USA Emergency operate "standalone ERs" that are 100% out-of-network, meaning that they bill crazy sums that are either negotiated down by insurers or passed along to patients.

The final component of this incredible fraud comes from Unitedhealthcare, the largest insurer in the country. They have been gouging like crazy during the pandemic, racking up $6.6B in earnings in Q2-2020 alone. This has drawn a ton of scrutiny and criticism, naturally.

Which may explain why the company simply greenlit this obviously fraudulent charge (and why their internal fraud investigators were totally blase when Sussman called them up).

They're making incredible, towering sums profiteering off the pandemic and sending it to shareholders and execs, rather than upgrading their creaking anti-fraud systems. They don't want to call attention to any of this and mess up their good thing.

The CARES Act mandates insurers to pay for (many) covid tests, and the grossly inefficient, wildly profitable health-care system has used this as an excuse to gouge the grossly inefficient, wildly profitable insurance sector.

Nobody (except plutes from the shareholder class) wins when these two giants wrestle one another.

The lesson of this awful scandal is that a broken, for-profit health-care system can't be fixed by mandating care.

Without a publicly accountable, public-spirited health care system, the CARES Act's mandate to pay for testing was just an invitation for the grossly unethical for-profit care system to gouge insurers.

The exception to this is Medicare, which caps pricing for antibody tests at $42.13. Ironically, Sussman told Propublica he only came forward because he opposes Medicare for All and fears that abuses will give the existing system a bad name.

"If instances like these go unchecked it will provide more ammo for advocates of a single-payer system."

&lt;h1&gt;A New American Manifesto (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/25/dwergish-girl/#pursuit-of-happiness"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In case you'd forgotten just how subversive and angry the Declaration of Independence actually is, in case the words have turned into hollow platitudes due to repetition and archaic language, feast your senses upon "A New American Manifesto."

&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@absurdistwords/a-new-american-manifesto-c75f35318091"&gt;https://medium.com/@absurdistwords/a-new-american-manifesto-c75f35318091&lt;/a&gt;

Absurdist Words has updated the Declaration into contemporary, informal language, updating the references for eerie correspondences to our current political fights:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Here are the Receipts:
  
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He is lawless. He has no respect whatsoever for the rules of this country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has interfered with state Governors’ abilities to take care of their states in times of crisis, constantly breaking promises and being unreliable, just to wear them down so that they will do whatever he wants and then neglects them even when they do it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has abused the powers of the Presidency, leveraging people’s rights for business purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He turns public events into personal campaign stunts, wearing all the rational people down with his antics and erratic behavior...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;...We tried to be empathetic to those who support Trump and his nationalism. We tried to give them the heads up that they had made a terrible choice. We tried to remind them that many of them were immigrants and that they should think twice about how we deny others entry. We tried to appeal to their sense of honor. To their sense of civics. To their sense of duty. We tried to appeal to the fact that we’re all in this together and that we are all one nation. We tried to explain that backing authoritarianism would be terrible for everyone.But they wouldn’t listen. We tried. We wanted to fight Trump together. But they mock justice and shun the idea of unity. So nothing personal, but they picked a side.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Adventures of a Dwergish Girl (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/25/dwergish-girl/#you-are-a-pickle"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Few authors have had as much influence on my progress as a human being - to say nothing of my writing - as Daniel Pinkwater. The course of my life was profoundly altered by reading Alan Mendelsohn, the Boy From Mars in middle school, and I have read dozens of his books since.

I find that many distinctive authors circle themes and plots, like a cannoneer rangefinding with artillery, trying to bullseye some impossible-to-define perfect target. I county myself in that group, and I definitely count Pinkwater there.

I can't tell you exactly what it is he's trying to hit, but every book seems to come closer to some irreducible Pinkwaterian ideal, and his latest, Adventures of a Dwergish Girl, is the closest he's come yet.

&lt;a href="https://tachyonpublications.com/bestselling-author-daniel-pinkwater-returns-in-classic-form-with-the-illustrated-middle-grade-adventures-of-a-dwergish-girl/"&gt;https://tachyonpublications.com/bestselling-author-daniel-pinkwater-returns-in-classic-form-with-the-illustrated-middle-grade-adventures-of-a-dwergish-girl/&lt;/a&gt;

First, let me attempt* to summarize the plot. Dwergs are basically a magical race inhabiting the Hudson Valley. They're something like Tolkien's dwarves, but not. Male dwergs are pretty odd-looking and rarely venture into the world.

*"Attempt" is doing a lot of work here.

But female Dwergs, like protagonist Molly O'Malley, can pass for short-ish humans, albeit with very large feet and the ability to move with uncanny speed through the woods near Kingston, NY.

Molly can't abide the sameness and dullness of life in the unchanging, eternal Dwergish village of her birth, so she moves to Kingston, NY, where she befriends Arnold Babatunji, a Naples-obsessed restaurateur who runs the Hudson Valley's greatest pizzeria, who hires Molly.

For a time, life is good. Molly learns about pizza, pals around with a former boy-genius who runs the village radio station, and sleeps in a forest dwelling of her own devising, supplementing her income with the cash from the lumpy Dwergish gold coin she's pawned.

But the pawn-broker is tied up with gangsters - some of them ghosts, some living - and then Molly befriends Leni, an indigenous girl whose people have lived in the Catskills since time immemorial.

Leni tempts Molly to ride the Greyhound to NYC, where she rides the subway, and, more importantly, samples the indescribable wonderments of papaya juice and all-beef franks, which change her life.

And of course, while in New York, Molly encounters Carlos Chatterjee, a Revolutionary War reenactor who runs a spectacular junk shoppe on the mezzanine of an uptown MTA station.

Carlos turns out to be crucial to the resolution of Molly's main challenge, which is the transdimensional meat-robots in British redcoat uniforms who seem to be bent on reenacting the 1777 burning of Kingston (spoilers!).

Averting this disaster is a big project for Molly, who enlists the Catskills Witch (who has moved to Manhattan) and the semi-mythical King of the Dwergs, who uses bee-style waggle-dancing to advise them.

This is a book with:

So.

Much.

Stuff.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/cNaMB71.jpg"/&gt;

My all-time favorite place to eat in NYC is Shopsins. Pinkwater novels are like expanded Shopsins menus.  Motto: "nothing exceeds like excess." But this isn't mere kitchen-sinkery: it's skilled wunderkammering, a carefully curated study in contrasts.

&lt;a href="https://www.shopsins.com/s/order"&gt;https://www.shopsins.com/s/order&lt;/a&gt;

Pinkwater insists that his books aren't "weird" and even bristles at the suggestion:

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanielPinkwater/status/1227548549199650817"&gt;https://twitter.com/DanielPinkwater/status/1227548549199650817&lt;/a&gt;

I take him to mean that he's describing the world as he perceives it, not adding any weirdness. We live in a weird place. 2020 certainly proves that hypothesis.

I think there's something to this - the thing that makes Pinkwater's work so great is his ability to describe the everyday absurdity in terms that make it clear how weird normalcy is (and vice-versa).

That's definitely Dwergish Girl's charm. I read this to my 12 year old, who is way too cool to be getting bedtime stories of her old, irrelevant father's favorite weird writers.

Every night, she insisted that she didn't want me to read from it. Every night, she begged for another chapter when I was done (and interrupted repeatedly to ask incisive questions about the Revolutionary war, papaya juice, ghosts, radio announcers, etc).

Pinkwater's got The Magic (whatever that is) and he keeps getting better at it.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;a name="proroguer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/ss-l1600.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Trudeau promises massive covid stimulus (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/25/dwergish-girl/#proroguer"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Canadian Prime Ministers have a fun gambit: when things start to go really badly for them, they "prorogue" (suspend) Parliament, which dissolves all committees, inquiries, etc, until such time as they are ready to reconvene, with a tabula rasa.

Most egregiously, the far-right asshole and climate criminal Stephen Harper prorogued Parliament in the middle of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis in order to avoid a no-confidence vote that would have triggered new elections.

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Canadian_parliamentary_dispute"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Canadian_parliamentary_dispute&lt;/a&gt;

While this DID save Harper's bacon, it also left Canada without a legislature during a global crisis that threatened the nation's entire future. It was a crazed, reckless thing to do.

Canada has a safeguard to prevent this kind of gambit: as a constitutional monarchy, Canadian parliamentary manoeuvres have to receive the Crown's blessing, in the form of assent from the Governor General, the Queen's rep to Canada.

This is the sober, apolitical adult supervision that fans of constitutional monarchies are always banging on about, and then-Governor General Michaëlle Jean completely failed to do her fucking job, leaving Canada without a Parliament during the GFC. She literally had one job.

Proroguing Parliament didn't just save Harper from a no-confidence vote: it also dissolved all the Parliamentary inquiries underway at the time, including the "Afghan detainee transfer" affair, which was investigating Canadian forces' complicity in the torture-murder of POWs.

In many ways, Trudeau is the anti-Harper: a charismatic Liberal who tells refugees they're welcome in Canada, marches with Greta Thunberg, and appoints the first-ever First Nations person to serve as Attorney General .

Truly, there is no policy so progressive that Trudeau won't endorse it...provided he doesn't actually have to make it into policy. Because many of his policies are indistinguishable from Harperism, albeit with a better haircut.

This started before he won the election, when Trudeau (whose father once declared martial law!) whipped his MPs to vote for a human-rights-denying mass surveillance bill, C-51.

Trudeau did so while insisting that the bill was a massive overreach and totally unacceptable, but claiming that the "loyal opposition" should still back it so as not to be accused of being soft on terrorism in the coming election. He promised to repeal it after.

Of course, he didn't.

Trudeau is often compared to Obama, a young and charismatic fellow who makes compromises, sure, but comes through in the clutch.

Tell that to pipeline protesters.

After the Obama administration killed the Transmountain Pipeline - the continent-spanning tube that would make filthy, planet-destroying tar sands profitable enough to bring to market - Trudeau bailed it out, spending billions of federal dollars to keep it alive.

Then, Trudeau - who campaigned on nation-to-nation truth and reconciliation with First Nations - announced that he would shove this toxic tar-sand tube through unceded treaty lands across the breadth of the nation.

And then he had the &lt;em&gt;audacity&lt;/em&gt; to march with Greta Thunberg at the head of a climate march, demanding a change to policies that would see billions dead in the coming century.

&lt;em&gt;His own&lt;/em&gt; policies.

I mean, Trudeau's boosters have a point - Harper &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; could have pulled that off.

The Harper years were a Trumpian orgy of blatant self-dealing and cronyism.

The Trudeau years, on the other hand...

One of Trudeau's major donors is SNC Lavalin, a crime syndicate masquerading as a global engineering firm (think Halliburton with less morals).

SNC Lavalin had done so much crime that it was on its final notice with the Canadian legal sysem, a probation that it must not violate on penalty of real, big boy federal criminal prosecutions.

Then it did more crimes.

Remember Trudeau's historic appointment of a First Nations woman to the Attorney General's seat? Now was AG Jody Wilson-Raybould's moment to shine.

As Wilson-Raybould began aggressively pursuing these corporate criminals, she started getting calls from Trudeau's office.

For avoidance of doubt, these were not calls of support. They were demands to drop the case and let the SNC Lavalin crime syndicate get off scot-free. Eventually the PM himself called her and demanded that she give his cronies a pass on their repeated criminal actions.

Wilson-Raybould went public, decrying political meddling in the justice system. Trudeau denied everything and began to smear her (Harper had tons of scandals like this, BTW, only the counterpart was usually a rich old white guy, not a First Nations woman).

But Wilson-Raybould had recorded the conversations, and she released the recordings, and proved that Trudeau had lied about the whole thing. Trudeau fired her and kicked her out of the party.

But at least he's not Trump, right? He's the anti-Trump! (Well, except for the pipeline and that time he announced "No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave them there").

Remember the Muslim Ban? As Trump was tormenting refugees at the US border, Trudeau tweeted "To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp;amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada."

Yes, that was awesome. There is no policy so progressive that Trudeau won't endorse it...provided that he never has to do anything to make it happen.

Canada and the US have a "Safe Third Country Agreement" that says that asylum-seekers turned away from the US border can't try again in Canada. To make #WelcomeToCanada more than a hashtag, Trudeau's government would have to suspend that agreement.

Instead, Trudeau's government insisted that under Trump, "the conditions of the Safe Third Country Agreement continued to be met" and thus they would not suspend the agreement and give hearings to those turned away by Trump's border guards.

But at least Trudeau handled the pandemic better than Harper handled the Great Financial Crisis.

No, really, he did!

Mostly.

I mean, unless you were in a nursing home or on a First Nations reservation.

&lt;a href="https://www.canadalandshow.com/podcast/an-emergency-season-pandemic/"&gt;https://www.canadalandshow.com/podcast/an-emergency-season-pandemic/&lt;/a&gt;

But still, Trudeau's government did a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better job than the Trump government, or Boris Johnson's Tories. Neither Liberals nor Conservatives will really fight cronyism, climate change or authoritarianism, but there are still substantive differences between them.

But in some ways, they are depressingly similar.

Take corruption.

Long before the plague struck, Canadaland was publishing damning reports on We Charity, a massive, beloved Canadian charitable institution nominally devoted to ending child slavery.

Canadaland's initial reporting on the charity focused on its partnerships with companies that were using child slaves to make their products, but the investigations mushroomed after the charity sent dire legal threats to the news organisation over its coverage.

And then Canadaland founder Jesse Brown found himself smeared by a US dirty-tricks organization that got its start working for GOP politicians, who got a contract to plant editorials criticizing Canadaland's We coverage in small-town US newspapers.

Private eyes started following Brown around, even keeping tabs on his small children. Rather than being intimidated, Brown kept up the pressure on We, which prompted whistleblowers to leak him even more details about the charity's activities.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/03/turnkey-authoritarianism/#we-charity"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/03/turnkey-authoritarianism/#we-charity&lt;/a&gt;

These included massive, mysterious real-estate holdings, hard-to-excuse criminal investigations of its Kenyan activities, and (here's where I've been going with this all along) &lt;em&gt;giant cash payments&lt;/em&gt; to Trudeau's family, as well as valuable gifts to his Finance Minister.

And, as with the Wilson-Reybould affair, Trudeau's initial response to this was to simply deny it, calling his accusers liars. But then the scandal kept unspooling, his Finance Minister quit in disgrace, the charity (sort of) folded up and shut down, and Trudeau...

Well, Trudeau prorogued Parliament, shutting down Canada's government in the midst of a crisis that was - unimaginably - even worse than the 2008 crisis that Harper had left the nation rudderless through to avoid his own scandal.

(Again, for constitutional monarchy fans, that's two entirely political proroguings in the midsts of global crises, signed off on by the Queen's supposedly apolitical and sober check on reckless activity)

Shutting down Parliament seems to have rescued Trudeau's government from snap elections, which may well have been won by the Tories, who have resolved their longstanding racist and plutocratic tensions with a new ghoulish nightmare leader:

&lt;a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/09/canada-erin-otoole-conservative-party-cpc/"&gt;https://jacobinmag.com/2020/09/canada-erin-otoole-conservative-party-cpc/&lt;/a&gt;

And, as Trudeau has reconvened Parliament, he's promised something genuinely amazing: a massive, national stimulus package meant to keep families, workers and small businesses afloat through the looming second pandemic wave.

&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-canada-economy/canada-bets-the-farm-on-big-spending-as-second-wave-threatens-economic-recovery-idUSKCN26F1NF"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-canada-economy/canada-bets-the-farm-on-big-spending-as-second-wave-threatens-economic-recovery-idUSKCN26F1NF&lt;/a&gt;

This is something Canada - and the US, for that matter - desperately needs. Canada is monetarily sovereign: it issues its own currency and its debt is in the same currency, meaning it can never run out of money (no more than Apple could ever run out of Itunes gift cards).

The Canadian government &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; face constraints on its spending, but they're just not &lt;em&gt;monetary&lt;/em&gt; constraints - they're &lt;em&gt;resource&lt;/em&gt; constraints. If the Canadian government creates money to buy the same things the private sector is shopping for, there'll be a bidding war, AKA inflation.

But as a new wave of lockdowns and mass illness looms over the country, there's going to be a hell of a lot of things the private sector isn't trying to buy - notably, the labour of the Canadian workforce, millions of whom will be locked indoors through the winter.

An analyst warns that Trudeau's proposal is likely to add CAD30B to the deficit, which is a completely irrelevant fact unless that new money is going to be chasing the same goods that Canadian business and citizens are seeking to buy.

Trudeau has promised to create a national prescription drug plan (a longstanding hole in Canada's national health care system), as well as universal childcare, and he's denounced austerity as a response to the crisis.

There's a part of me that is very glad to see this. My family and friends are in Canada, after all, and if Trudeau lives up to his promise, he will shield them from the collapse we're seeing in the USA.

But that is a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; if. Trudeau isn't Harper. He's more charismatic, he's got better hair, and he says much, much better things than Harper.

However, when the chips are down, Trudeau out-Harpers Harper.

Mass surveillance legislation. Corruption scandals. Lying about corruption scandals. Bailing out the pipeline. "No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave them there." Abandoning asylum-seekers to Trump's lawless regime.

"Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it's enemy action." It would be pretty naive to assume that merely because Trudeau has promised to do the right thing, that he will do the right thing.

Indeed, if history is any indicator, the best way to predict what Trudeau will do is to assume that it will be the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; of whatever he promises.

I won't lie. I felt a spark of hope when I read Trudeau's words.

But hope is all I've got - and it's a far cry from confidence.

Or relief.

&lt;h1&gt;Belarus's online/offline uprising (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/28/cyberwar-tactics/#belarus"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

"Europe's last dictator," Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, has been a kind of test-case for the efficacy of various technologically enabled pro-democracy tactics for decades.

Back in 2006, protesters in Minsk challenged his ban on protests by announcing that eating ice-cream was a form of protest, then they showed up and ate ice-cream...and got arrested.

&lt;a href="https://users.livejournal.com/litota-/photo/album/2445"&gt;https://users.livejournal.com/litota-/photo/album/2445&lt;/a&gt;

They followed this up by announcing that smiling at each other was a form of protest and showed up, smiling, in the same square, and were met with hundreds of riot cops who later rounded up the organizers:

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2006/10/05/belarus-smile-mob-or.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2006/10/05/belarus-smile-mob-or.html&lt;/a&gt;

But opposition groups kept organizing, using international online spaces, even after visiting websites hosted outside of Belarus was declared a misdemeanor.

And while the country had little technological capacity of its own, it was able to buy turnkey authoritarian services from the likes of the Swedish company Teliasonera and Italian arms-dealer Hacking Team.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/05/swedish-telcom-giant-teliasonera-caught-helping-authoritarian-regimes-spy-its"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/05/swedish-telcom-giant-teliasonera-caught-helping-authoritarian-regimes-spy-its&lt;/a&gt;

With new surveillance gear in place, Lukashenko was able to do things like enumerate the identity at every attendee at a protest via their mobile phones.

&lt;a href="https://charter97.org/en/news/2011/1/12/35161/"&gt;https://charter97.org/en/news/2011/1/12/35161/&lt;/a&gt;

But despite this, protests kept growing. After all, Lukashenko is a terrible leader.

It wasn't just the blatantly stolen "elections" - it was flexes like arresting a one-armed man for clapping:

&lt;a href="https://loweringthebar.net/2013/01/one-armed-man-arrested-for-clapping.html"&gt;https://loweringthebar.net/2013/01/one-armed-man-arrested-for-clapping.html&lt;/a&gt;

And lavish dingbattery like equipping school uniforms with special "anti-cancer pockets":

&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090820215848/http://neteffect.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/08/13/belarus_develops_school_uniform_that_makes_tin_foil_hates_obsolete"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090820215848/http://neteffect.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/08/13/belarus_develops_school_uniform_that_makes_tin_foil_hates_obsolete&lt;/a&gt;

But these paled in comparison to the substantive bad policies, like an extremely high tax levied exclusively against unemployed people, during a deep recession, called the "Tax on social parasites."

&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-protests-idUSKBN15Y0PB"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-protests-idUSKBN15Y0PB&lt;/a&gt;

The current Belarusian uprising was triggered by yet another stolen election, but it represents decades of grievances and trauma, loved ones and leader arrested and put to hard labor, torture, privation, and terror.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/14/shock-doctrine/#walkaway"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/14/shock-doctrine/#walkaway&lt;/a&gt;

And the regime seems closer to collapse than at any previous time, thanks to the protesters perseverance and endless ingenuity. First, riot cops downed their shields, embraced protesters, and refused to arrest them.

Then, demonstrators started doxing the balaclava-clad, badgeless shock troops, exposing their identities ahead of major protests, inviting the men behind those masks to contemplate their fates if the Lukashenko regime falls.

&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hackers-appear-leak-personal-data-1-000-belarusian-police-officers-n1240566"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hackers-appear-leak-personal-data-1-000-belarusian-police-officers-n1240566&lt;/a&gt;

Most recently, protesters hacked into the state TV channels to broadcast footage of police violence against peaceful demonstrators.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BFreeTheatre/status/1309940635646992384"&gt;https://twitter.com/BFreeTheatre/status/1309940635646992384&lt;/a&gt;

The protestors' accompanying Telegram post read: "If Belteleradiocompany does not want to show people the truth, we will show it."

&lt;a href="https://112.international/society/cyber-partisans-hack-websites-of-state-channels-in-belarus-55069.html"&gt;https://112.international/society/cyber-partisans-hack-websites-of-state-channels-in-belarus-55069.html&lt;/a&gt;

It sure feels like we're living through an unprecedented boom in newsletters, but while email-based newsletters are experiencing a major surge, newsletters themselves have a long and honorable history.

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/peak-newsletter-that-was-80-years-ago/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/peak-newsletter-that-was-80-years-ago/&lt;/a&gt;

In Wired, Michael Waters describes the newsletter boom of the 1930s, starting with Claud Cockburn's "The Week," launched in 1933 out of disgust with his employer, The Telegraph, and its right-wing complacency (Cockburn went on to break the story of Franco's fascist coup).

The rise of cheap mimeographs - coupled with the USPS's subsidy for printed materials - created a boom in all kinds of niche and political publications, from sf fanzines to Allen Ginsburg's self-published chapbooks to The Ladder, a 1950s lesbian newsletter.

Left-populism had a major home in newsletters, providing an alternative to the pro-big-business/pro-monopoly/anti-labor/anti-New Deal bias of the newspaper industry.

I hadn't known about In Fact, the newsletter founded by the ex-Chicago Tribune muckraker George Seldes.

Seldes billed In Fact as "An Antidote for Falsehood in the Daily Press," reached 176,000 subscribers, and featured exposes on strike-breakers, tobacco industry/newspaper conspiracies to cover up smoking-related health risks, and FBI anti-union spying.

In Fact inspired IF Stone to start his legendary Weekly, a 20-year newsletter that Stone published to 70,000 subscribers from a hand-cranked mimeograph machine.

But this golden age of leftist newsletter publishing was crippled by the Red Scare, and the risks of appearing on a list of subscribers to a radical publication.

The right's newsletters - paranoid, proto-Bircher publications like Joseph P Kamp's Headlines, and What's Behind Them ("Are Communists Infiltrating the YMCA?") morphed into the powerful newsletters published by Ayn Rand and Phyllis Schlafly, buoyed by the direct mail boom.

Today, the legacy of the direct mail boom is a clutch of wealthy, ruthless grifters making enormous bank by terrorizing elderly Fox viewers into making donations they can't afford.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/20/no-mask-no-service/#dorr-brothers"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/20/no-mask-no-service/#dorr-brothers&lt;/a&gt;

But lefty, anti-monopoly newsletter publishing is also alive and well, as tech startups like Substack promise both revenue streams &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; access to the last truly federated distribution system: email.

I really enjoy many of these new newsletters, though I worry that, on the one hand, they include a lot of invasive tracking, and on the other, that consolidation in email providers makes them incredibly dependent on Big Tech's forbearance.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/08/the-last-federated-platform/#postal-inspectors"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/08/the-last-federated-platform/#postal-inspectors&lt;/a&gt;

I have my own (totally independent, tracker-free, zero analytics, ad-free) newsletter, the Plura-List.

&lt;a href="https://mail.flarn.com/mailman/listinfo/plura-list/"&gt;https://mail.flarn.com/mailman/listinfo/plura-list/&lt;/a&gt;

I've discovered that if a bunch of my subscribers on, say, Apple Mail, don't open their daily newsletters, Apple's analytics classes the publication as spam for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; subscribers on its platform.

The consolidated nature of email is also very apparent in the software I use for the Plura-list, the venerable Mailman tool, a creaking dinosaur that looks terrible and is difficult for both publishers and subscribers to use.

And yet, it's the best option if you want to host your own mailing lists (rather than exposing your subscribers to potential data-mining, etc).

Meanwhile, if this history of mailing lists has you intrigued, I strongly urge you to check out the anthologies of IF Stone's Weekly.

&lt;a href="http://ifstone.org/collected_writings.php"&gt;http://ifstone.org/collected_writings.php&lt;/a&gt;

I discovered these in the early 90s when I was working at Toronto's College Books, where the owner, Michael Jackel, had ordered them for our politics section. These anthologies absolutely blew my mind and transformed the way I thought about personal political writing.

Decades later, they still resonate.

&lt;a name="aligned-incentives"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/3374184512_9ff198e665_c.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Zombie banks (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/28/cyberwar-tactics/#aligned-incentives"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

It's an open secret that many of America's largest banks are "zombies" - institutions that are able to carry on despite having a negative net worth, thanks to "a combination of implicit and explicit government credit support."

"Masters of Illusion: Bank and Regulatory Accounting for Losses in Distressed Banks," is a new Institute for New Economic Thinking paper by Boston College finance prof Edward J Kane that reveals the collusion between bank accountants and financial regulators to conceal losses.

&lt;a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/research-papers/masters-of-illusion-bank-and-regulatory-accounting-for-losses-in-distressed-banks"&gt;https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/research-papers/masters-of-illusion-bank-and-regulatory-accounting-for-losses-in-distressed-banks&lt;/a&gt;

Bank accountants want to help their employers stay solvent, while regulators don't want the public to spook and stampede, which would cause a run on the bank. All this is laid out in a layperson-friendly article accompanying the paper

&lt;a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-bankers-hide-losses"&gt;https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-bankers-hide-losses&lt;/a&gt;

Taken together, accountants and regulators have a "disposition toward supervisory informational deception and regulatory forbearance" and during crises, this comes to the fore, allowing zombie banks to borrow even more money under the expectation that they will be bailed out.

The degree to which banks are guaranteed to be solvent regardless of recklessness and deception means that any time you see an insider running away from a bank, you should assume that things are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad.

Kane: "The processes through which bankers extract benefits from the safety net  closely resemble those of embezzlement and the rewards bankers garner  usually rise to the level of grand larceny. The difference between  street crime and safety-net abuse lies mainly in the class and clout of  the criminal and the subtlety of the crime."

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-23-at-12.37.44-PM.png"/&gt;

And as ever, a chart tells quite a story: the Big Four accounting  firms failed 808 audits between 2009-17, and faced only 53 enforcement actions.

&lt;h1&gt;The Trump financial method (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/28/cyberwar-tactics/#grifts"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

If you read the NY Times' blockbuster report on Trump's taxes, you've likely come away with the (correct) impression that Trump is:

a) broke, and

b) dirty.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html&lt;/a&gt;

But you're also likely fuzzy on the details, not because they were missing from the report, but because there were SO MANY of them.

Finance grifts deploy what Dana Simpson calls "The shield of boringness," a layer of performatively dull accounting provisions that obscure an otherwise simple and banal con.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/04/a-mind-forever-voyaging/#prop-bets"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/04/a-mind-forever-voyaging/#prop-bets&lt;/a&gt;

So while the details are important in a "we brought receipts" sense, the actual shape of the scam can be expressed in a very few words, as David Fickling's thread demonstrates:

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidfickling/status/1310380939600510978"&gt;https://twitter.com/davidfickling/status/1310380939600510978&lt;/a&gt;

Here it is in a nutshell: Donald Trump is VERY bad at business. Every business he starts spends a lot more than it makes, and he loses a lot of money from them. But Donald Trump has lucked into stakes in various profitable businesses that smarter people ran.

Whether it's his father's fortune, or The Apprentice, or Manhattan's Far West Side (businesses with competent managers other than Trump), Trump brings two things to the table:

I. Losses; and

II. Fraud.

Profits are taxable, so profitable businesses generate tax liabilities. But if you're Trump and you've got a profitable business (The Apprentice) in one hand, and a bunch of money-pits (his clubs) in the other, you can use the losses to offset the profits and pay no tax.

And then, if you're willing to commit fraud, you can increase these tax offsets and actually turn them into tax REBATES, so the government ends up paying YOU millions and millions of dollars.

The frauds are really simple. He just declares everything a business-expense and deducts it from his taxes. Tens of thousands of dollars for his hairdresser. Lavish vacations. Etc, etc.

And he pays his family members to "consult" for his businesses, spreading income around among them, gaining access to new fraud vehicles.

It's welfare fraud: claiming fake expenses for dependents in order to get more money out of the system.

However, if you are a low-impulse-control dum-dum who can't stop building losing businesses, eventually your losses will outstrip the profits from the businesses run by smart people and you'll go broke.

Which is why Trump has gone bankrupt so many times, and why he owes $300m for loans that he personally guaranteed, which come due in four years.

Also: Trump is bad at fraud. Like, if you're going to claim that your daughter is a "consultant" to your company in order to funnel millions to her to generate bogus tax rebates, it helps if you don't make videos where she declares herself to be an executive in that company.

Which is why the IRS is about to clobber him for $72m in tax fraud, which will come out to about $100m with penalties and interest.

So, tldr: he's bad at business, he's bad at fraud, he makes money only when he's not able to wrest control of a subsidiary from smart people, and now he owes about $400m.

And he's broke.

The end.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/AttackSurface-header.png"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Attack Surface excerpt (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/28/cyberwar-tactics/#chapter-1"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In just two weeks, Tor Books publishes ATTACK SURFACE, the third Little Brother book! To celebrate, they're serializing Chapter 1 on the web at tor.com:

&lt;a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/09/28/read-an-excerpt-from-cory-doctorows-attack-surface-part-1/"&gt;https://www.tor.com/2020/09/28/read-an-excerpt-from-cory-doctorows-attack-surface-part-1/&lt;/a&gt;

Attack Surface is a standalone novel intended for adults and set in the world of Little Brother. It's the tale of Masha Maximow, a surveillance contractor who's far better at computers than Marcus Yallow, hero of Little Brother and Homeland, and who works for the other side.

Here's how Tor put it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Most days, Masha Maximow was sure she’d chosen the winning side.
  
  In her day job as a counterterrorism wizard for an transnational cybersecurity firm, she made the hacks that allowed repressive regimes to spy on dissidents and track their every move. The perks were fantastic, the pay was obscene.
  
  Just for fun, and to piss off her masters, Masha sometimes used her mad skills to help those same troublemakers evade detection. It was a dangerous game and a hell of a rush. But seriously self-destructive. And unsustainable.
  
  When her targets were strangers in faraway police states, it was easy to compartmentalize, to ignore the collateral damage of murder, rape, and torture. But when it hits close to home, and the hacks and exploits she’s devised are directed at her friends and family—including boy wonder Marcus Yallow, her old crush and archrival, and his entourage of naïve idealists—Masha realizes she has to choose.
  
  And whatever choice she makes, someone is going to get hurt.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you like the sound of that and pre-order the book before the release date, you also get Force Multiplier, a free Little Brother ebook and audiobook:

&lt;a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/"&gt;https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/&lt;/a&gt;

Tor's publishing in Canada and the US; if you're in the UK or another English-speaking country, you can get the Head of Zeus edition, which comes out on Oct 1, giving you just days to request a copy of Force Multiplier:

&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBcoOM3m3fCwipXRcexWuBD4nZMIF13r2StmSnpT5amD4Icg/viewform?usp=send_form"&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBcoOM3m3fCwipXRcexWuBD4nZMIF13r2StmSnpT5amD4Icg/viewform?usp=send_form&lt;/a&gt;

And speaking of the audiobook, you have a mere NINE DAYS to pre-order it for $15 via Kickstarter, after which it will set you back $25:

&lt;h1&gt;MK-Ultra and the brainwashing grift (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/09/boss-politics/#brainwashed"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

If you meet someone who claims to have created a system for controlling other peoples' minds, you know that they are:

a) Delusional;

b) A fraudster; and

c) A sociopath.

This goes for Rasputin, Mesmer, and self-satisfied Big Tech boasters who claim that machine learning deprives of us our free will.

And it &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; goes for the CIA, whose MK-Ultra plot to perfect mind control was a kind of ghastly running joke.

Writing in Jacobin, Alex de Jong offers a great potted history of MK-Ultra and its architect, the US government chemist Sidney Gottlieb, who, with "rehabilitated" Nazi and Imperial Japanese scientists, performed secret brainwashing experiments.

&lt;a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/10/cia-brainwashing-program-mk-ultra-sidney-gottlieb/"&gt;https://jacobinmag.com/2020/10/cia-brainwashing-program-mk-ultra-sidney-gottlieb/&lt;/a&gt;

The article is keyed to the upcoming paperback release of "Poisoner in Chief: Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA Search for Mind Control," Stephen Kinzer's award-winning 2019  book on Gottlieb and his brainwashing experiments.

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250140432"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250140432&lt;/a&gt;

The experiments were genuinely awful: from fogging the San Francisco Bay with bacterial pathogens to dosing suspected spies with stimulants and depressants to extract confessions from them, then secretly murdering them and dumping their bodies.

It all kicked into high gear when Gottlieb encountered LSD, and began nonconsensually dosing Americans with huge amounts of it, starting with prisoners in an Appalachian addiction hospital, then branching out to unwitting research subjects at MIT, Stanford and Johns Hopkins.

Then he hired sex-workers to entrap johns in NYC and SF, luring them to rooms where they were kidnapped and megadosed with acid.

All that is terrible, but what's fascinating about it from a modern perspective isn't merely their immorality, it's their scientific uselessness.

These CIA experiments were undertaken in secret, and they were exploring a hypothesis: is mind-control possible? Did American POWs defect to North Korea because the Soviets had mind-control?

Over and over, the answer these experiments generated was a resounding &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;.

Everything they tried to do failed, repeatedly, dismally, and with terrible human costs. And yet, at every turn, the scientists involved - eminent scientists who'd done productive work in the nonsecret world of peer review - kept telling themselves they were succeeding.

And so did their paymasters! The entire operation is an incredible example of how the scientific method - and its transparency and adversarial peer review - are what prevents scientists and funders from falling prey to motivated reasoning.

Everything MK-Ultra did was a radioactively obvious failure, but all these super-smart, powerful people repeatedly talked themselves into viewing their experiments as success.

Their hypothesis ("Is mind control a thing?") was actually a conclusion ("Mind control is definitely a thing, and we have to figure it out"). But as we say in the crypto wars, wanting something badly is not enough.

All of this reminds me so much of Big Data and Big Tech, behavioral ads and behavioral modification. Back when hard drives got cheap and the web got wired for surveillance, the industry concluded, a priori, that with enough data, intentions could be divined... and shaped.

We were presented with this in IPO documents and conference presentations as a fait accompli, rather than as a hypothesis. The companies attracted vast amounts of capital and built vast surveillance and analysis systems.

For many of us, the existence of these systems was proof that they were onto something: "No one would fund this if it wasn't producing." Advertisers flocked to behavioral ads because they were convinced on this basis that they must work.

The ad industry's most successful product, of course, is itself: its ability to convince advertisers that it will spend its money wisely and multiply it through scientifically proven marketing techniques.

Just as the CIA's most successful product wasn't mind-control, it was the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of mind-control, which excited the congressjerks who held their purse-strings.

And, like Gottlieb, the ad-tech industry performed nonconsensual human experiments. Remember back in 2012, when Facebook dosed 61,000,000 unsuspecting users with messages that were supposed to get them to vote?

&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401"&gt;https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401&lt;/a&gt;

And, like Gottlieb, they trumpeted this as a success! Those 61,000,000 interventions yielded an additional 60,000 votes - that is, a little less than a &lt;em&gt;tenth of a percent&lt;/em&gt; of people who received the dose changed their behavior in a tiny way. &lt;em&gt;Success!&lt;/em&gt;

Some people look at this experiment and recoil in horror at the thought that Facebook has perfected a mind-control ray. I look at it and think, well, the first time you exposed 61m people to a tactic, 0.1% of them responded.

Many of those people will become inured with repeat exposure, so mostly what this shows is that FB is really bad at doing what they charge people money for: influencing its users' behavior.

But it also shows something else: that FB are monsters.

Because anyone who TRIES to build a mind-control ray is a sociopath. Anyone who funds a mind-control ray is a sociopath. Anyone who invests in a mind-control ray is a sociopath. Trying to make mind-control a thing disqualifies you from participating in decent society.

But working in secret to do impossible, wicked things doesn't mean you'll succeed. It means you'll probably end up kidding yourself, even as you fail and fail and fail.

That doesn't make you harmless. Gottlieb and FB both destroyed the lives they touched.

But it means we should address you as a sociopathic fraudster who got high on your own supply - not as a supergenius whose secret invention puts the future of human free will at risk.

The only people these evil clowns really manage to brainwash is themselves and the people who pay their bills. Everyone else, they merely torture.

&lt;h1&gt;Machine Democrats (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/09/boss-politics/#tammany-hall"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Sometimes you have conversations that just stick with you. In 2006, I went to lunch with Eric Flint at the World Science Fiction Convention in Anaheim; we got to talking about Obama and whether he'd run for president.

All I really knew about Obama then was his 2004 DNC speech, which was and is a remarkable rhetorical feat, full of inspiration and aspiration. I said as much to Eric, who told me, basically, that I wasn't from Chicago and so I couldn't understand.

He explained that Chicago Democratic politics were Machine politics, a form of cynical, transactional politics that elevated power rather than ideology, and that Obama's success in the Machine meant that he would be a horse-trader, not a populist.

That conversation came back to me when Obama was elected and unceremoniously shut off the server grassroots campaigners used to get him elected, smashing a powerful popular movement into a collection of atomized individuals assigned a new role: cheering from the sidelines.

I watched in the years after as Obama attempted to govern in smoke-filled rooms where he and his rival power-brokers hammered out deals, a strategy that &lt;em&gt;bombed&lt;/em&gt;. The GOP had an unruly mob - the Tea Party - who were all in on ideology, while all Obama had soaring rhetoric.

Republicans who gave Obama an inch got primaried by this activated, frothing base. Meanwhile, the ideological and committed base that Obama had mobilized in 2008 were stuck on the sidelines.

I never really understood Machine politics beyond a few cliches about Tammany Hall and whatever I'd gleaned from watching Gangs of New York.

Today, I read "The Other Democratic Party," by Stephanie Muravchik and Jon A. Shields:

&lt;a href="https://thebulwark.com/author/stephanie-muravchik-and-jon-a-shields/"&gt;https://thebulwark.com/author/stephanie-muravchik-and-jon-a-shields/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/bostweedanimation.gif"/&gt;

It's an excerpt from "Trump's Democrats," their new book based on three years of fieldwork living in historically Democratic counties that swung for Trump in 2016.

&lt;a href="https://brookings.edu/book/trumps-democrats/"&gt;https://brookings.edu/book/trumps-democrats/&lt;/a&gt;

The authors describe a kind of Democratic politics - and Democratic voter - whose commitment to the party was based on Machine politics: the "boss politics" of places like Ottumwa IA, Johnston RI, and Elliott County KY.

These are places where top political offices are essentially hereditary, and where elected officials routinely fill political appointments with relatives and cronies - but also where party stalwarts and supporters are "taken care of."

Where the local political boss has a weekly kaffeeklatsch in a diner where you can petition to have your potholes fixed or to for a job in the dominant industry. These bosses act like Trump.

I don't mean that they hand out favors in this gross, transactional way (though they do), but also that they are bellicose, petty, vengeful, and prone to vicious rhetoric about people who fail to show them "respect."

In any two-party system, each party will be a coalition: in the GOP, it's bankers, racists, violent sociopaths and swivel-eyed religious nuts.

Historically, the Democrats were a coalition of southern aristocratic white supremacists and northern labor movements.

LBJ's signing of the Civil Rights Act in 64 triggered a "great realignment" with Dixiecrats mostly migrating to the GOP.

Today, the Democrats are still a fragile coalition, a fact that was obvious during the primary.

But Muravchik and Shields suggest that the Trump election was another kind of realignment, with the GOP going all-in on boss politics, and drawing in voters - and politicians - who like that kind of arrangement.

They're saying that the GOP has become the party of Richard Daley, Jim Traficant, and Rod Blagojevich - the party you vote for if you want policy made by horse-traders in smoke-filled rooms who shiv their enemies and reward their cronies.

But in a coda, they say that Trump is not great at boss politics. The thing that made boss politics a staple for more than a century was that bosses were effective - they actually made life better for the people who paid them fealty.

Bosses actually cared about the people they bossed - it was a twisted and flawed and often revolting love, but it was love nonetheless. Trump barely bothers to hide his contempt for America and the people who vote for him.

I learned about them this morning and even though i have a million things I should be doing, I just keep scrolling through his endless Tumblr.

Quintessentially cyberpunk in that they hint at a world where technology is romantic, noirish, sexy and sinister.

The Davis Graveyard is a Portland, Oregon treasure: a family run, nonprofit annual haunt that is indescribably ambitious, spooky and brilliantly executed.

&lt;a href="http://davisgraveyard.com/"&gt;http://davisgraveyard.com/&lt;/a&gt;

The Davises have been serving their city for more than a decade, but in Sept they announced that they would not be putting on a show this year, due to the risk of exacerbating the pandemic. It was a heartbreak, but it was also the right call.

But this story has a happy ending. The Clackamas County Scare Fair is a 20-30 minute drive-through, pandemic-safe haunt with a soundtrack broadcast on low-power FM radio, and the Davis Haunt has been integrated into it!

&lt;a href="https://www.clackamas.us/fair/clackamas-county-scare-fair"&gt;https://www.clackamas.us/fair/clackamas-county-scare-fair&lt;/a&gt;

Tickets are $20 for "as many people as you can legally fit in your car" or $11 for a solo. It's yet another reason I wish I lived in the region (I tried to move my family there in 2015 when we emigrated to the USA, but we ended up in LA, which has some badass haunts, too).

&lt;h1&gt;RIAA kills youtube-dl (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/24/1201-v-dl-youtube/#1201"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In 1998, Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act into law. At the time, most of the attention was on Section 512 - AKA "notice and takedown," which absolves platforms from liability for users' infringement provided they respond quickly to removal demands.

Over the years, this has been horrifically abused, with everyone from post-Soviet dictators to sexual predators to cults and literal Nazis using spurious copyright claims to censor their critics, often without consequence.

But the real ticking time-bomb in the DMCA is Section 1201, the "anti-circumvention" rule, which makes it a felony (punishing by a 5-year prison sentence and a $500k fine) to help people tamper with "access controls" that restrict copyrighted works.

This rule means that if a company designs its products so that you have to remove DRM to use them in legal ways, those uses become felonies. DMCA 1201 is how Apple and John Deere make it a felony for anyone except them to fix their products.

They just design their devices so that after the repair is complete, you need an unlock code to get the system to recognize new parts. Bypassing the unlock code defeats an "access control" and is thus a literal crime.

But there's no copyright infringement here! Swapping a new part into a phone, a tractor or a ventilator is not a copyright infringement. And yet, it is still a (criminal) copyright VIOLATION. DMCA 1201 lets companies felonize ANY conduct that is adverse to their shareholders.

It's "felony contempt of business model" and you can go to prison for it.

Thing is, it would be easy to fix this law. If you thought that DRM deserved its own legal protection, you could get there just by adding "this only applies when copyright infringement takes place."

But from the very first days, it was clear that DMCA1201 was NOT about preventing copyright infringement, it was about enforcing business models. The first users of this law were DVD manufacturers who wanted to stop the public from "de-regionalizing" their DVD players.

The manufacturers and studios had cooked up a racket where they would sell DVDs at different prices in different countries, and they didn't want Americans shopping for cheap DVDs in India.

But going into a store in Mumbai and paying the asking price for a licensed DVD and watching it in NYC is NOT infringement. It is how copyright is supposed to work: a rightsholder names a price, an audience member pays it, then they get to enjoy the work they've bought.

Likewise the early consoles that also took advantage of DMCA 1201. If you own a Sega Dreamcast and I write a game for your Sega Dreamcast and sell it to you, we are doing copyright right: a creator and an audience member exchanging creative works for money.

But Sega - and the App Store businesses it spawned up to and including Apple - used DMCA 1201 to make it a felony for creators to sell their works to audiences without cutting the device manufacturer in for a commission.

Now that everything has software in it, DMCA 1201 can be brought to bear on an ever-widening constellation of devices, from medical implants to kitchen appliances, from printer ink to insulin pumps.

My novella Unauthorized Bread is fiction, but the DRM abuses in it are deadass real:

&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/&lt;/a&gt;

The metastasis of DRM is a gift to monopolists, who can corral customers, independent competitors and toolsmiths into arrangements of their design.

When the Napster Wars began, the RIAA represented the Big Six record labels. Today, it represents the Big THREE labels, as an entire realm of human endeavor stretching back to a time before language itself is now the near-exclusive purview of three giant corporations.

They are tightening the noose. Yesterday, the RIAA sent a DMCA 1201 takedown notice to Github demanding the removal of youtube-dl, a venerable and popular tool for format-shifting Youtube videos.

&lt;a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md"&gt;https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md&lt;/a&gt;

As Parker Higgins documents in a brilliant, scathing thread, the complaint is a masterwork of legal shenanigans, claiming that because someone COULD infringe an RIAA member's copyright by saving a Youtube video, Github MUST remove tools that permit this.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/1319738279772770308"&gt;https://twitter.com/xor/status/1319738279772770308&lt;/a&gt;

The RIAA's lawyers don't mention the millions of hours of public domain Youtube videos that archivists have preserved using youtube-dl, nor the Creative Commons licensed videos that are unambiguously lawful to download with youtube-dl.

Nor do they mentions the limitations to copyright that sometimes make it lawful to download ANY video from Youtube.

DMCA 1201 isn't just a charter to transform your commercial desires into legal obligations, it is also a powerful censorship tool.

I started this essay talking about DMCA 512, the "notice and takedown" rule. That says that if you believe your copyright is being infringed, you can fire off a notice to the host and demand its immediate removal. If they comply, you can sue their user, but not them.

In 1998, Congress recognized that this was ripe for abuse, and created a "counternotice": if your material is taken down and you think you are in the right, you can counternotify the host and they can put your stuff back up, again, without being liable if you're wrong.

If the rightsholder complains again, the host either removes the content (the rightsholder and user can go to court), or they can leave it up if they think the complaint is BS. This system has been wildly inadequate at protecting legit speech, but it's better than nothing.

And "nothing" is what you get under 1201. When the RIAA complains about youtube-dl to Github, Github pulls it down, but if the developers counternotify them, Github can't restore the files without facing CRIMINAL liability (5  years/$500k).

Copyright trolls have long figured this out: DMCA 1201 is a superweapon for getting content removed from Google and elsewhere: if you assert that someone who recorded you doing something abusive is violating 1201, that video goes down and STAYS down, with no counternotice.

DMCA 1201 is a goddamned dumpster fire, a surefire recipe for techno-corporate dystopia. EFF is suing to overturn it. That trial can't come fast enough:

&lt;h1&gt;Facebook loses users, makes more money (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/30/rigged-game/#tails-you-lose"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In 2017, 15m 13-34-year-old US Facebook users left the service. These are Facebook's most valuable users, worldwide, and this was the largest-ever exodus from Facebook.

But all of those users simply shifted over the Instagram

&lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/tech/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions/"&gt;https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/tech/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions/&lt;/a&gt;

The theory of market economies is that the best companies with the best products and services attract the most customers. But when competition regulators allow large companies to gobble up little competitors to prevent them from growing into threats, markets become moneyball.

The Instagram acquisition - like other FB acquisitions, eg Whatsapp and Oculus - were explictly predatory, designed to reduce competition in the market and preserve profits by depriving customers of choice.

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21345723/facebook-instagram-documents-emails-mark-zuckerberg-kevin-systrom-hearing"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21345723/facebook-instagram-documents-emails-mark-zuckerberg-kevin-systrom-hearing&lt;/a&gt;

That strategy works great (for FB and its shareholders). This year, Facebook has haemorrhaged US/Canada users - its most valuable users - and still seen surging earnings.

&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2020-earnings-204642328.html"&gt;https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2020-earnings-204642328.html&lt;/a&gt;

The company booked 22% year-on-year growth in the last quarter. Tellingly, FB now advises shareholders that the important indicator of the company's health isn't Facebook users, it's the "family of apps" number, combining FB, Instagram and Whatsapp.

In other words: heads Zuck wins, tails we lose.

&lt;h1&gt;DRM horror-stories needed (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/30/rigged-game/#1201"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In 1998, Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act into law, including Section 1201, while felonizes the distribution of tools to bypass "access controls" (AKA DRM).

Practically speaking, that means if your printer cartridge has a digital lock that stops you from refilling it, then anyone who makes a tool to unfuck your printer risks a 5-year prison sentence and a $500k fine.

DMCA 1201 is an unmitigated disaster. Companies use this law to force you to sideline your own interests and instead conduct yourself to the sole benefit of their shareholders.

All they need to do is design the product so that using it your way means breaking DRM and your way becomes a literal felony: from repair to security audits, from consumables to parts, from apps to features.

DRM has proliferated as a means of enforcing shareholder preferences in your own home.

When DMCA1201 passed, Congress charged the US Copyright Office with holding hearings every three years to uncover potential problems with this very problematic law.

At these "triennials," people whose legitimate activities have been undermined by DRM can go before a committee of Copyright Office lawyers and beg for the right to use their stuff their way.

To its credit, the Copyright Office has granted many exemptions over the years despite objections from big entertainment and tech companies. But these exemptions are only for "uses" and not "tools."

When the Copyright Office grants archivists the rights to bypass DRM to preserve media, it can't authorize anyone to give those archivists a tool to accomplish this use.

Or an exemption for visually impaired people to bypass DRM on ebooks so they can be used with screenreaders, Braille printers or text-to-speech: this permits each blind person to find and exploit defects in ebook DRM, but not to help one another, or get help from others.

There are instances in which a use exemption does some good: for example, if you want to make interoperable diagnostic tools for cars, a use exemption lets you bypass the engine's DRM to learn what the error codes mean, and then build a tool that interprets them for others.

And many archivists are comfortable with sourcing underground tools to bypass DRM once they know they can legally use those tools.

But for the most part, the best thing we can say about use exemptions is they force the US government to document the defects in DMCA 1201.

The DMCA has a 22 year track record, and it's uniformly terrible, and getting worse - DMCA 1201 is how Medtronic is preventing independent hospital technicians from repairing their ventilators, RIGHT NOW, during a once-in-a-century pandemic.

Documenting the law's defects is more urgent than ever, especially as competition regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are investigating the ways that DRM creates and reinforces monopolies.

And you can help!

In 2021, the Copyright Office will once again consider petitions for exemptions to DMCA 1201, and @EFF is looking for your stories to help us craft our slate of proposed new exemptions.

If you have a story about how:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone in the United States;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;attempted or planned to repair, modify, or diagnose a product with a software component; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;encountered DRM  that prevented completing the modification, repair, or diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—we want to hear from you!

"Please email us at RightToMod-2021@eff.org with the information listed below, and we’ll curate the stories we receive so we can present the most relevant ones alongside our arguments to the Copyright Office."

&lt;h1&gt;Boundless Realms (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/09/boundless-realm/#fuxxfur"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

There's a lot of fascinating writing about Disney theme parks and theme park design more generally on the internet, but no one thinks and writes like Foxx Nolte, who is always brilliant, but never moreso than when she is writing about the Haunted Mansion.

Nolte has just published her first book on the subject: Boundless Realm, and - speaking as someone who's read dozens of books on theme parks and the Mansion - I can say that it is the very best book on the subject ever written.

&lt;a href="https://passport2dreams.blogspot.com/2020/10/now-available-boundless-realm-deep.html"&gt;https://passport2dreams.blogspot.com/2020/10/now-available-boundless-realm-deep.html&lt;/a&gt;

There are multiple explanations for the popularity of the Mansion, and Nolte manages to synthesize all of them into a beautiful, unitary whole.

One major strand of Mansionology claims that the ride's virtuosity is in its coherence, the stories that run through it.

The competing view is that the Mansion's popularity is down to its incompleteness, its incoherence. Famously, the ride went through many conceptual overhauls, driven in part by Walt Disney's ambivalence about the idea of a rotting mansion in his spotless park.

From the idea of a scary house at the end of Main Street to Rolly Crump's psychedelic walk-through "Museum of the Weird," to the Davis/Coats/Gracey/Atencio rides built in Anaheim and Orlando, the Mansion is a collage of elements that survived multiple reconceptualizations.

The theory goes that the mismatched elements included in the opening-day design (and the layers of removals and additions since) created a kind of rich, surprising stew, a salmagundi whose lack of coherence engages our imagination to connect the unconnectable dots.

And Nolte synthesizes these two views - brilliantly. Having worked as a Mansion castmember, interviewed many former "butlers" and "maids" as well as Imagineers; having examined the vast trove of material surviving about the Mansion's design process and the source materials online sleuths uncovered, Nolte squares the circle.

Yes, it's brilliant because it collects the very best elements from several strong (and narratively irreconcilable) concepts.

But it's also brilliant because it's &lt;em&gt;thematically&lt;/em&gt; coherent: it tells a story less about the Mansion's inhabitants than it is about you, the rider.

Nolte brings to bear her incredible design sense and her ability to articulate the way that design elements - sightlines, lighting, music and SFX - tell a tale that is multisensory, subliminal and that reaches far deeper into our imaginations than mere words.

The Mansion's tricks - Pepper's Ghost effects, scrolling paintings, crossfading reverse-projections, etc - are easy enough to understand and even to replicate in a home Hallowe'en haunt.

But the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; tricks - the way that the designers immerse you in an atmosphere that has a real, narrative arc that is both unmissable and nearly impossible to pin down - are far harder to detect, let alone describe or replicate.

That is the real genius of Nolte's work, the reason I so faithfully read her blog. Her ability to make those design decisions legible and comprehensible to someone who has a severe deficit in that department (me), is like a magic trick every time.

Like noticing the ghostly face in the abstract wallpaper or spotting the eyes on a tombstone open for just a flicker, Nolte's work never fails to give me a surprising, even shocking moment of satisfying revelation.

At book length, she's even better. This is a remarkable achievement - and a definitive one.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/burning_schoolhouse.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Student data breaches vastly underreported (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/09/boundless-realm/#leaky-edtech"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Even before lockdown, ed-tech had taken over America's public schools, with students increasingly completing assignments, accessing course materials and messaging each other and teachers through monolithic ed-tech platforms .And where you have IT, you have breaches.

Ed-tech breaches are particularly ghastly - they've leaked teachers' databases of which kids are being bullied; students' medical and mental-health records; and information needed to steal millions from classroom funds.

But as the K-12 Cybersecurity Resource Center reports, the extent of these breaches has been vastly underreported, because breach-reports count compromised VENDORS, not compromised SCHOOLS.

&lt;a href="https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-what-happens-when-private-student-information-leaks/"&gt;https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-what-happens-when-private-student-information-leaks/&lt;/a&gt;

So when Pearson - one of the monopolistic giants of the ed-tech world - experienced a breach in 2018, that was counted as a single incident, even though it affected 135 school districts, each with many schools.

The GAO's official breach figures count only 25% of the known breaches - and no one is counting the un-reported breaches, which the project believes could raise the figure by a factor of 10 or 20.

&lt;h1&gt;UK corporate registrar bans code-injection (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/09/boundless-realm/#timmy-drop-tables"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Companies House, the British registrar of newly formed companies, has forced a firm to rename itself from

&amp;#x22;&amp;#x22;&amp;#x3E;&amp;#x3C;SCRIPT SRC=HTTPS://MJT.XSS.HT&amp;#x3E; LTD

On the grounds that merely including the name of the company on a web-page (including the Companies House website) could trigger cross-site scripting attacks.

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/06/companies-house-forces-business-name-change-to-prevent-security-risk"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/06/companies-house-forces-business-name-change-to-prevent-security-risk&lt;/a&gt;

The company - run by a self-described "playful" IT consultant - has changed its name to:

THAT COMPANY WHOSE NAME USED TO CONTAIN HTML SCRIPT TAGS LTD

The company joins other nerd humor business names that Companies House has rejected, including the XKCD-inspired

; DROP TABLE "COMPANIES";-- LTD

I remain slightly disappointed that my wife refused to allow me to put curly-braces in my daughter's middle name, or even an old school "+++ATH".

While the UK continues its crackdown on code-injection attacks in official names, Ireland remains a free-fire zone full of people with surnames like O\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'Brien and OO&amp;#x26;#039;Malley.

&lt;h1&gt;Monopolies made America vulnerable to covid (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/03/ministry-for-the-future/#big-health"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

It's now well understood that covid is not an equal-opportunity butcher: it kills and maims poor and racialized people at a much higher rate than those further up the privilege gradient.

The precise reason for this is not known, but we have a general understanding of the underlying phenomenon. Poor and racialized people greeted the pandemic in worse shape than wealthier, whiter people.

People who lack health care and good jobs and good housing are more likely to get chronic illnesses and less likely to be able to control those illnesses. Inequality weakens, and covid delivers the coup de grace.

Poor and racialized people in America are a microcosm for America in the world. For America - despite its wealth and power - has fared worse than many other countries, large and small, populous and sparse, landlocked and islands.

More Americans have the disease, and those who have it die more. Much of this is down to the lack of federal coordination, chaos at the state and local levels, and the transformation of masking and distancing into a culture war issue.

But as Susie Cagle illustrates (literally) in her comic strip for The Nation, America has a chronic illness that weakened it and made it vulenerable to the virus: that illness is called "monopolies."

&lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/coronavirus-healthcare-consolidation/"&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/society/coronavirus-healthcare-consolidation/&lt;/a&gt;

America's health-care system isn't just overpriced and dysfunctional - it is also monopolized. Private equity-backed hospital chains like HCA, Providence and Ascension have gobbled up many hospitals across the country and converted them into wildly profitable slaughterhouses.

The pharma industry is also wildly profitable, has decreasing regard for human life, and is massively consolidated. Pharma giant Gilead monopolizes the distribution of the publicly funded covid treatment Remdesivir. Monoclonal antibody treatments are likewise monopolized.

The FTC has an official policy of not applying ANY merger scrutiny when a hospital with fewer than 100 beds is being acquired, leading to mass-scale consolidation of small rural and regional hospitals,

Runaway, ruthless capitalism does the same thing to America as a nation as it does to its poorest people: weakens it by sapping it of its productive capacity and its resilience.

&lt;h1&gt;The Ministry For the Future (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/03/ministry-for-the-future/#ksr"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

One of the very last events I attended before the lockdown was a thing in Silicon Valley attended by many old friends, but the best moment of all was the chance to hang out with Kim Stanley Robinson, a friend and inspiration.

That's when Stan told me he had just finished a book that might be his last-ever novel, The Ministry For the Future, and that his future work would be nonfiction, starting with his long-planned book about the Sierras.

I was stricken. Robinson's novels are a lifeline for me.

The first Robinson novel I read may just be my favorite: Pacific Edge, a green utopian novel about a successful transition to a post-climate-emergency, just and stable world. Re-reading it is a vacation from all my anxieties, still.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2015/01/15/pacific-edge-the-most-uplifting-novel-in-my-library/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2015/01/15/pacific-edge-the-most-uplifting-novel-in-my-library/&lt;/a&gt;

My first novel, DOWN AND OUT IN THE MAGIC KINGDOM, wouldn't exist without Pacific Edge. That was the book that taught me that small disputes over beloved local treasures could be as dramatic as (and microcosms for) global conflicts.

I have been both dreading and anticipating MINISTRY FOR THE FUTURE, not wanting to read my last KSR novel but also wanting so badly to read this one, because it's the book in which he imagines the end of capitalism.

You've heard the phrase, "It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism," variously attributed to Frederic Jameson and Slavoj Žižek. As the author of a couple of postcapitalist novels, I have a real appreciation for the details of that truism.

It's actually not all that hard to imagine a postcapitalist society - but imagining the actual &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of capitalism, the euthanasia of the rentier, the reversal of the doctrine of virtuous selfishness, the abandonment of the idea that some are born to rule, that is damned hard.

And while PACIFIC EDGE is my favorite KSR novel, my favorite KSR series is the string of books that starts with 2012's 2312 - a string of books that really leans hard into imagining the actual end of capitalism.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2012/10/30/kim-stanley-robinsons-2312-a-novel-that-hints-at-what-we-might-someday-have-and-lose/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2012/10/30/kim-stanley-robinsons-2312-a-novel-that-hints-at-what-we-might-someday-have-and-lose/&lt;/a&gt;

2312 is set 300 years into postcapitalism. It's a novel of solar-system-scale civilization, riven by its own problems and contradictions, filled with tech marvels, a tale of natural wonders that showcase Robinson's incredible, John-Muir-grade genius for pastoral writing.

2312 was followed up by Aurora, one of the best space-exploration novels ever written, about the arrival of the first-ever generation ship at its destination world, and the hasty retreat it is required to stage.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2015/11/02/kim-stanley-robinsons-aurora-space-is-bigger-than-you-think/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2015/11/02/kim-stanley-robinsons-aurora-space-is-bigger-than-you-think/&lt;/a&gt;

The book provoked a vitriolic reaction from science fiction's great reactionaries! I love a book that enrages the right people, and I was delighted to publish Robinson's rebuttal to their peevish complaints.

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2015/11/16/our-generation-ships-will-sink.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2015/11/16/our-generation-ships-will-sink.html&lt;/a&gt;

From there, we move on to New York 2140, a novel of a pivotal moment in the transformation of capitalism and its relationship to the climate emergency.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2017/03/18/new-york-2140-kim-stanley-robinson-dreams-vivid-about-weathering-climate-crisis/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2017/03/18/new-york-2140-kim-stanley-robinson-dreams-vivid-about-weathering-climate-crisis/&lt;/a&gt;

These are like an artilleryman rangfinding a mortar, first overshooting his target and then walking his fire back, drawing closer to his bullseye. For Robinson, bullseye is the moment at which our society is transformed into one that can survive the coming emergencies.

It's telling that the 2312 books never got there. It is so fucking hard to imagine the end of capitalism.

But that is what The Ministry For the Future Does.

Sort of.

It's a novel about a specialized UN agency, chartered through the Paris Climate Agreement to represent unborn generations and the natural world in legal proceedings related to climate devastation.

Talking about this book, Robinson has described it as a kind of futuristic documentary, told in many voices, as a way of describing a phenomenon as vast as this global transformation.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#ksr"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#ksr&lt;/a&gt;

Like many docs, it follows a couple of main characters, but weaves in dozens of other voices, some of whom we hear from only once or twice, recounting pivotal moments in which a moment calves away from our reality as we know it - moments of shear, giddy and terrifying.

Robinson is so good at this stuff. This is the book that he has been practicing for all his life. The vignettes are superb little jewels, mostly illuminating flashbulb moments in the lives of strangers met fleetingly.

But some of the most powerful moments don't even have characters: there's a transcript of the openng a fictional congress of global climate remediation groups after the crisis that is just an alphabetical list of countries and their associated projects.

This literally made me burst into tears of joy, bursting with hope at the thought that we could, as a species, spawn so many evocative and hopeful projects to save our world, our species, and our nonhuman cohabitants.

It's a real list, as it happens: Spherical Studio's Regen Earth, a collection of regenerative projects presented in short films, maintained by David McConville to "to help folks see the lived, active and diverse potential of ecological regeneration and the critical role that humans play in these systems. They are real projects, revealed through stories."

&lt;a href="http://regen.earth/"&gt;http://regen.earth/&lt;/a&gt;

Robinson's versatility is on glorious display here: from long lists of hypothetical ecological projects, he veers into closely told moments of human endeavor in the natural world, showcasing his pastoralism with scenes so vivid you could reach out and touch them.

But all that said, the most interesting thing about this book is the stuff that Robinson couldn't or wouldn't put on the page. Robinson's hypothetical scenario for the end of capitalism is a baroque scheme of global cryptocurrency money-creation tied to carbon drawdown.

His technocrats trick capitalism into spending itself out of existence in a plan that is by turns brainy and daffy (as all blockchainism tends to be), with some pretty epic handwaving (especially when it comes to the breakup of tech monopolies).

But all of that would fail were it not for acts of absolutely brutal, ruthless terrorism. Robinson's transformation isn't merely about the carrots of double-bluff get-rich-quick schemes, it's heavily dependent on the stick of terror.

The aviation industry isn't (just) replaced by airships and rail because it's better and cleaner - but also because parties unknown use drones to bring down every private jet in the sky, and then commercial liners, until the aviation industry seizes up and dies.

And the world doesn't abandon beef because vegans win the moral argument or because greenies win the practical one - the decisive factor is drones that dart an unknowable plurality of the world's cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

There's more - pitiless, remorseless, anonymous. And while Robinson gets up close and personal with one traumatized individual who engages in an ecologically motivated, short-lived (and nonlethal) kidnapping, we never meet any of the terrorists or their victims.

The terror that begets the transition is recounted in the dry language of an encyclopedia entry, not dramatized like the pivotal moments of so many other characters.

It's a very telling omission.

My 2019 novella "Radicalized" is about an online community of men who, after watching their most treasured family members die slow, painful, preventable deaths because of insurance company fuckery, become suicide bombers who murder health execs.

&lt;a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/05/who-says-violence-doesnt-solve-anything-a-review-of-radicalized-four-tales-of-our-present-moment-by-cory-doctorow.html"&gt;https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/05/who-says-violence-doesnt-solve-anything-a-review-of-radicalized-four-tales-of-our-present-moment-by-cory-doctorow.html&lt;/a&gt;

Writing that story was an intensely uncomfortable experience (and, judging from reader comments, it can be uncomfortable to read, too).

It's one thing to recognize that a systemic problem might not be solved without grotesque, mass violence, and another to put yourself in the shoes of either the perpetrators or the victims.

Robinson's end of capitalism is, superficially, a story of a transition, not a spasm, not a capital-T Terror. The lives we inhabit in this novel are people who are engaged in struggle, but not mass-murder.

But right there on the page is Robinson's uncomfortable and only partially elided conviction that we're not in for a transition, but rather a bloodletting, a reckoning commensurate with the ecocidal crimes that led up to this moment.

MINISTRY is a book that, on first consideration, feels like a utopia - not merely for the beautiful descriptions of people, animals and environments finding a way through the emergencies, but for the emergencies resolution.

But on closer examination, MINISTRY represents the dark fears of one of our brightest, most hopeful writers, that the world can only be saved by means that are literally too terrible to contemplate up close.

It's an uncomfortable read. It's a brilliant book. If it indeed turns out to be Stan's last novel (oh please don't let it be Stan's last novel), it will be a fitting capstone. But the subtext of this book is that we are past the point of no return.

Not only will rescuing our planet entail sacrifices of species, habitats, and coastlines - it will also entail sacrifices of the moral convictions that make vast spectacles of bloodletting unthinkable.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/graffiti_subway.0.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Graffitists hit dozens of NYC subway cars (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/03/ministry-for-the-future/#getting-up"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

New York's subway trains were once highly contested, moving art galleries, completely skinned with overlapping coats of graffiti (think of the opening credits of Welcome Back, Kotter).

&lt;a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Mmm3KTa601s"&gt;https://youtube.com/watch?v=Mmm3KTa601s&lt;/a&gt;

NYC declared war on graffiti in 1972, but it wasn't until 1984 that the Clean Trains movement took hold (previous attempts to erase graffiti with acid solutions literally started to dissolve the cars). Graffiti all but disappeared from the New York Subway.

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_New_York_City_Subway#Graffiti"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_New_York_City_Subway#Graffiti&lt;/a&gt;

Until last night. Graffiti crews covered two dozen MTA cars with top-to-bottom "burner" murals not seen since graffiti's glory days, spanning multiple, adjacent cars.

&lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/12/2/22149612/two-dozen-subway-cars-struck-in-overnight-graffiti-storm"&gt;https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/12/2/22149612/two-dozen-subway-cars-struck-in-overnight-graffiti-storm&lt;/a&gt;

Writing in The City, Jose Martinez offers tantalyzing details of the feat - executed between 1 and 5AM in tunnels and out-of-service storage tracks, in areas that the NYPD nominally patrols.

The burners decorate cars on the 1, 6, M, G, Q and 42nd Shuttle. The scope really comes out in this video posted to the nycgraff.head Instagram account.

&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIN8iJvpLMy/"&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/CIN8iJvpLMy/&lt;/a&gt;

Martinez's descriptions give a sense of the pieces: "...Its first five cars covered in spray-painted flames, mushrooms, tags and a bare-breasted pot-smoking character with a resemblance to Betty Boop."

&lt;h1&gt;Breathtaking Iphone hack (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/03/ministry-for-the-future/#awdl"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

AWDL is Apple's mesh networking protocol, a low-level, device-to-device wireless system that underpins tools like Airdrop. It is implemented in the Ios kernel, a high-privilege, high-risk zone in Iphone and Ipad internals.

A researcher at Google's Project Zero, Ian Beer, found a vulnerability in AWDL that allowed him to wirelessly infect Ios devices, then have them go on to spread the virus wirelessly to any Ios devices they came into contact with.

&lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-ios-zero-click-radio-proximity.html"&gt;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-ios-zero-click-radio-proximity.html&lt;/a&gt;

The proof-of-concept attack undetectably grants  "full access to the user's personal data, including emails, photos, messages, and passwords and crypto keys stored in the keychain."

&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/iphone-zero-click-wi-fi-exploit-is-one-of-the-most-breathtaking-hacks-ever/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/iphone-zero-click-wi-fi-exploit-is-one-of-the-most-breathtaking-hacks-ever/&lt;/a&gt;

Beer developed the exploit virtually single-handedly over six months and confidentially disclosed its details to Apple, which issued patches for it earlier this year. Now that the patch has had time to propagate, Beer has released a detailed, formal account of his work.

The 30,000 word technical paper is heavy reading, but if you want inspiration to delve into it, try the accompanying 14-second video, which is one of the most remarkable (and alarming) infosec clips I've ever seen.

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikZTNSmbh00"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikZTNSmbh00&lt;/a&gt;

As far as can be known, this was never exploited in the wild. In his Ars Technica coverage of the exploit, Dan Goodin drops the other shoe: "If a single person could do all of this in six months, just think what a better-resourced hacking team is capable of."

It's a theme that Beer himself explores in a Twitter thread, in which he describes the tradeoffs in protocols like AWDL, whose ease of use was critical in private messaging by Hong Kong protesters last hear.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i41nbeer/status/1333884906515161089"&gt;https://twitter.com/i41nbeer/status/1333884906515161089&lt;/a&gt;

But whose "large and complex attack surface [exposed] to everyone in radio proximity" creates a security nightmare if there are any bugs at all in the code...and unfortunately the quality of the AWDL code was at times fairly poor and seemingly untested."

It's a sobering reminder that companies can't fully audit their own products. Even companies with sterling security track-records like Apple slip up and miss really, really, REALLY important stuff.

It's really at the heart of understanding why independent security research must be protected - at a moment in which it is under assault, as out-dated laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act are used to punish researchers who go public with their work.

Dominant companies - including Google and Apple - have taken the position that security disclosures should be subject to a corporate veto (in other words, that companies should be able to decide when their critics can make truthful disclosures about their mistakes).

When the W3C introduced EME, it created the first-ever standardized browser component whose security defects could be suppressed under laws like the CFAA and Sec 1201 of the DMCA.

W3C corporate members opposed measures to require participants to promise NOT to punish security researchers who warned browser users of ways they could be attacked through defects in EME.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/open-letter-w3c-director-ceo-team-and-membership"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/open-letter-w3c-director-ceo-team-and-membership&lt;/a&gt;

And Google is presently using the DMCA to suppress code that reveals defects in its own EME implementation, Widevine, which has become the industry standard.

&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/google-mending-another-crack-in-widevine/"&gt;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/google-mending-another-crack-in-widevine/&lt;/a&gt;

In his thread, Beer rightfully praises both Apple and Google for having a bug bounty program that serves as a carrot to entice security researchers into disclosing to the company first and giving it time to patch before going public.

(And he calls on Apple to award him a bounty that he can donate to charity, which, with corporate charitable matching, would come out to $500K. This is a no-brainer that Apple should totally do).

But as laudable as the Bug Bounty carrot is, let us not forget that the companies still jealously guard the stick: the right to seek fines and even prison time for security researchers who decide that they don't trust the companies to act on disclosures.

That may sound reasonable to you - after all, it's reckless to just blurt out the truth about an exploitable bug before it's been patched. But companies are really good at convincing themselves that serious bugs aren't serious and just sitting on them.

When that happens, security researchers have to make a tough call: do they keep mum and hope that no one else replicates their findings and starts to attack users, or do they go public so that people can stop using dangerously defective products?

It's a call that Google's Project Zero has made repeatedly. In 2015, they went public with a serious, unpatched, widespread Windows bug when they got tired of waiting for Microsoft to fix it:

&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-02-google-posts-unpatched-microsoft-bug.html"&gt;https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-02-google-posts-unpatched-microsoft-bug.html&lt;/a&gt;

And in October, Google disclosed another Windows 0-day that was being exploited in the wild, presumably reasoning that it was better to tell users they were at risk, even if it meant giving ammo to new waves of hackers.

&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/googles-project-zero-discloses-windows-0day-thats-been-under-active-exploit/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/googles-project-zero-discloses-windows-0day-thats-been-under-active-exploit/&lt;/a&gt;

Bug Bounties are great - essential, even. But for so long as companies get to decide who can tell the truth about the defects in their products, bug bounties won't be enough. The best, most diligent security teams can make dumb mistakes that create real risk.

Your right to know whether you are at risk should not be subject to a corporate whim. The First Amendment - and free speech protections encoded in many other legal systems - provides a high degree of protection for truthful utterances.

The novel and dangerous idea that corporations should have a veto over the truth about their mistakes is completely irreconcilable with these free speech norms and laws.

&lt;a name="walkaway"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/https _bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_66cd0574-af47-4cfd-b8a9-b292eed1185f_846x291.png"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ford patents plutocratic lane-changes (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#walkaway"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In my 2017 novel WALKAWAY, there's a scene where the protagonists get into a self-driving car owned by a ruthless plutocrat, only to discover that it moves faster than any other vehicle they've ever ridden.

&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/"&gt;https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/&lt;/a&gt;

The plute explains that he's done an illegal mod that lets him override the lane-change safety margins and pay fines for it - an illustration of the principle that "a fine is a price."

It was meant as broad satire, not a suggestion.

Specifically, it was meant to satirize the idea that if you create "markets in everything" you'll get efficient allocations - some people &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to change lanes and others only &lt;em&gt;sorta&lt;/em&gt; want to change lanes but the lane-change slots aren't allocated according to priority.

There are so many flaws in this idea, but the biggest one is that some people are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rich and most people are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; broke and so a willingness on the part of a rich person to pay $X may indicate a mild preference, but a poor person might be indicating a strong preference.

If $X is 100% of a poor person's disposable income and 0.000001% of a rich person's disposable income, the rich person's whims trump the poor person's needs. This is going on around us, all the time.

The richest parts of London have the lowest covid rates but also the most rapid testing:

&lt;a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2020/12/04/wealthy-london-areas-low-covid-case-rates-included-in-rapid-testing-programme/"&gt;https://bylinetimes.com/2020/12/04/wealthy-london-areas-low-covid-case-rates-included-in-rapid-testing-programme/&lt;/a&gt;

Remember when Homer charged a $1000 baldness cure that revolutionized his life to the company insurance and cost Mr Burns his ivory-handled back-scratcher?

Burns: I was going to buy that ivory back scratcher. How did he do it?

Smithers: He charged the company for Dimoxinil.

Back to Walkaway. Cyberpunk has a funny relationship with capitalism's most ardent trufans: inevitably, the parts that are meant as warnings are read as suggestions.

Which brings me to Ford's Patent 20200380860: "Smart Contract Formation, Handling and Fulfilment Between Vehicles."

&lt;a href="https://trea.com/information/smart-contract-formation-handling-and-fulfilment-between-vehicles/patentapplication/ed72fddf-403e-4e5d-aeea-03cb2701296c"&gt;https://trea.com/information/smart-contract-formation-handling-and-fulfilment-between-vehicles/patentapplication/ed72fddf-403e-4e5d-aeea-03cb2701296c&lt;/a&gt;

It's written in the garbage legalese of all patent applications, but Patent Drop provides a handy translation: "imagine a car wants to merge... other vehicles would need to slow down, and in turn an inconvenience is created for them. Ford is proposing a system where the vehicles that need to slow down receive a payment for slowing down, while the vehicle that wants to do the slowing down, incurs a payment."

&lt;a href="https://www.newzstack.com/newsletters/015-patent-drop"&gt;https://www.newzstack.com/newsletters/015-patent-drop&lt;/a&gt;

But there's more! Are you using a private vehicle on a route served by public transit? You stand to be compensated!

"If a light changes prematurely to accommodate a bus, this could entitle all vehicles with a certain distance of the light to a certain payment."

I would say "You can't make this shit up," except that I make this shit up for a living, but - and I can't repeat this often enough - as a warning, not a suggestion.

&lt;h1&gt;All the books I reviewed in 2020 (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#recommended-reading"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

I know it's a little late for Xmas shipping, but I'm &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; getting around to publishing a roundup of all the books I reviewed in 2020!

&lt;b&gt;Part 1: FICTION FOR ADULTS&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/71WqLOpjn4L-1-1200x1811.jpg"/&gt;

I. AGENCY by William Gibson: A sequel to The Peripheral for the Trump years, about seductive bitterness of imagined alternate timelines, filled with cyberpunk cool and action.

&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2020-01-24/agency-william-gibson"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2020-01-24/agency-william-gibson&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/81mYF2BTR2B7L.jpg"/&gt;

II. RIOT BABY by Tochi Onyebuchi: An incandescent Afrofuturist novella that connects the Rodney King uprising with contemporary struggle, pitting supernatural powers against dire politics.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/23/riot-baby/#Tochi-Onyebuchi"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/23/riot-baby/#Tochi-Onyebuchi&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781250309013.jpg"/&gt;

III. OR WHAT YOU WILL by Jo Walton: A metafiction about the desperate attempt of a character to pull his writer into a fictional world to save the both from human mortality.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/07/little-bro-with-snowden/#metafiction"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/07/little-bro-with-snowden/#metafiction&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/281akj1031654_full.jpg"/&gt;

IV. A BEAUTIFULLY FOOLISH ENDEAVOR by Hank Green: Sequel to An Absolutely Remarkable Thing - a madcap and sometimes brutal tale of social media influencers, alien invaders, disinformation, and runaway capitalism.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/08/absolutely-remarkable-thing/#carls"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/08/absolutely-remarkable-thing/#carls&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/81XhaV9igBL.jpg"/&gt;

V. FAILED STATE by Christopher Brown: A legal eco-thriller that imagines the end of capitalism without imagining the end of the world - cyberpunk meets ecotopianism, with anarchist jurisdictions, show-trials, and rewilding.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/12/failed-state/#chris-brown"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/12/failed-state/#chris-brown&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/w1qk0oajo39bxypaelry.jpg"/&gt;

VI. AFTERLAND by Lauren Beukes: Eerily well-timed road-trip novel set after a prostate-cancer plague wipes out nearly every man on Earth, except for the protagonist's teenaged son, who is now being hunted by the (all-female) US government.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/28/afterland/#XY"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/28/afterland/#XY&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9780062672575_7e5a6d11-94c0-4887-87e1-e8937525c4e4.jpg"/&gt;

VII. BALLISTIC KISS by Richard Kadrey: Sandman Slim confronts the worst demons of all - his own trauma and self-doubt.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/25/anxietypunk/#bk"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/25/anxietypunk/#bk&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781524733452.jpg"/&gt;

VIII. SQUEEZE ME by Carl Hiaasen: Hiaasen was writing comedic whodunnits about improbable Florida Man types decades before the memes, and his Mar-a-Lago gator plague novel is a hectic and hilarious tale for our times.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#disappearing-act"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#disappearing-act&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9780356508849.jpg"/&gt;

VIII. THE MINISTRY FOR THE FUTURE by Kim Stanley Robinson: KSR says it's his last novel and I say it's the book he's been training to write all his life. If you like your climate fiction wrenching but still uplifting enough to move you to tears...

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/03/ministry-for-the-future/#ksr"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/03/ministry-for-the-future/#ksr&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/71SudsGzYnL.jpg"/&gt;

IX. SET MY HEART TO FIVE by Simon Stephenson: An absurdist robot-romp in the mold of Kurt Vonnegut about a robot who catches the disease of emotions and tries to treat it by moving to Hollywood to write screenplays about robots.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/01/cant-pay-wont-pay/#robot-rights"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/01/cant-pay-wont-pay/#robot-rights&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Part 2: NONFICTION FOR ADULTS&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/47353786._SX318-2.jpg"/&gt;

I. A PUBLIC SERVICE by Tim Schwartz: An incredibly practical, detailed guide for would-be whistleblowers (and journalists who work with them) to staying safe while spilling the beans.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/a-public-service-a-comprehensive-comprehensible-guide-to-leaking-documents-to-journalists-and-public-service-groups-without-getting-caught/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/a-public-service-a-comprehensive-comprehensible-guide-to-leaking-documents-to-journalists-and-public-service-groups-without-getting-caught/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/8155wb2Bo1eL-2.jpg"/&gt;

II. THE MONSTERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING by Keith Ammann: A sourcebook for RPG game-masters explaining how different kinds of monsters can use a variety of combat tactics that add depth, texture (and challenge) to your games.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/10/the-monsters-know-what-theyre-doing-an-rpg-sourcebook-for-dms-who-want-to-imbue-monsters-with-deep-smart-tactics/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/10/the-monsters-know-what-theyre-doing-an-rpg-sourcebook-for-dms-who-want-to-imbue-monsters-with-deep-smart-tactics/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/81MCwmMCZRL-2.jpg"/&gt;

III. SNOWDEN'S BOX by Jessica Bruder and Dale Maharidge: The incredible, true tale of how trust among friends allowed Snowden's leaks to safely transit from his home in Hawai'i to the hands of Laura Poitras and the journalists who reported the story.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/03/31/snowdens-box-the-incredible-illuminating-story-of-the-journey-of-snowdens-hard-drive/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2020/03/31/snowdens-box-the-incredible-illuminating-story-of-the-journey-of-snowdens-hard-drive/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/91q4pnxxDiL-2.jpg"/&gt;

III. ABOLISH SILICON VALLEY by Wendy Liu: A personal journey from a fully bought-in believer in Silicon Valley's meritocracy to a ferocious critic who demands tech to serve humanity, not a human race in service to the tech industry.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/04/14/abolish-silicon-valley-memoir-of-a-driven-startup-founder-who-became-an-anti-capitalist-activist/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2020/04/14/abolish-silicon-valley-memoir-of-a-driven-startup-founder-who-became-an-anti-capitalist-activist/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/jobguaranteereader.jpeg"/&gt;

IV. THE CASE FOR A JOB GUARANTEE by Pavlina Tcherneva: A fierce little book setting out an economic program to rescue the nation and the planet from a system that insists we can't even hope for a better world.

VII. SUBPRIME ATTENTION CRISIS by Tim Hwang: What's worse than having our lies destroyed by surveillance to manipulate us with ads? Having our lives destroyed by surveillance in order to fuel a fraudulent market in ad-based manipulation.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/monopolies-suck-9781982149703_xlg.jpg"/&gt;

VIII. MONOPOLIES SUCK by Sally Hubbard: There are plenty of &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; books about monopolies and the resurgence in antitrust, but Hubbard's is the most practical, providing the reader with excellent advice for actually &lt;em&gt;doing something&lt;/em&gt; about monopolism.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/27/peads-r-us/#sally-hubbard"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/27/peads-r-us/#sally-hubbard&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781250200891.jpg"/&gt;

IX. BREAK 'EM UP by Zephyr Teachout: The most lucid, readable, infuriating, energizing book on the rise of monopolies. Teachout never loses sight of the systemic nature of the problem, even as she uses individual stories to tell the tale.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/29/break-em-up/#break-em-up"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/29/break-em-up/#break-em-up&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/71mSnDML52L.jpg"/&gt;

X. BOUNDLESS REALM by Fox Nolte: There has never been a better book about the Haunted Mansion (indeed, this is one of the best books ever written about environmental design in general). Nolte goes &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; beyond trite wisdom about "storytelling."

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/09/boundless-realm/#fuxxfur"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/09/boundless-realm/#fuxxfur&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;b&gt;PART 3: GRAPHIC NOVELS&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/81BhcpNqjIL-2.jpg"/&gt;

I. YEAR OF THE RABBIT by Tean Viasna: A graphic memoir of Viasna's harrowing boyhood during the rise of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. It's a tale we've rarely seen through the eyes of a child, and brilliantly realized.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/22/year-of-the-rabbit-a-graphic-novel-memoir-of-one-familys-life-under-the-khmer-rouge/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/22/year-of-the-rabbit-a-graphic-novel-memoir-of-one-familys-life-under-the-khmer-rouge/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/FEMFUR_178-001_HD_5dfd82bc3ae678.35734751.jpg"/&gt;

II. FEMALE FURIES by Cecil Castellucci: Castellucci uses an obscure and anachronistic all-woman cast of DC Universe b-characters to tell an incredible, smart, pitiless story about #MeToo, comics, solidarity and betrayal.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/29/female-furies/#apokolips-now"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/29/female-furies/#apokolips-now&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/ca-times.brightspotcdn.com.jpeg"/&gt;

III. LONELINESS OF THE LONG-DISTANCE CARTOONIST by Adrian Tomine: A memoir of intensely felt impostor syndrome, a forceful reminder that comparison is the thief of joy - and that the traits that keep an artist going at first go toxic over time.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/21/the-thief-of-joy/#tomine"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/21/the-thief-of-joy/#tomine&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="http://craphound.com/images/81Q62ArQ0wL.jpg"/&gt;

IV. CONSTITUTION ILLUSTRATED by R Sikoryak: The Trump years were an unhappy crash-course in Constitutional law, but Sikoryak's genius adaptation of the Constitution in the style of dozens of cartoonists is a pure delight.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/27/ip/#r-sikoryak"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/27/ip/#r-sikoryak&lt;/a&gt;

PART 4: KIDS AND YA

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/1_71GxwJykCpL-2.jpg"/&gt;

I. SEND PICS by Lauren McLaughlin: A YA novel that's a thrilling revenge-play about "revenge porn," a cyber-heist novel that's also a sneaky and forceful book about teen girls' sexuality.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/04/21/send-pics-ripping-brutal-amazing-novel-about-teens-sextortion-revenge-and-justice/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2020/04/21/send-pics-ripping-brutal-amazing-novel-about-teens-sextortion-revenge-and-justice/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/impossible-music.jpg"/&gt;

II. IMPOSSIBLE MUSIC by Sean Williams: A YA novel about a music-obsessed kid who loses his hearing is the frame for a book about ability, adaptation, music theory, family, Deafness and what dreams are really for.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/30/deafhood/#impossible-music"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/30/deafhood/#impossible-music&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781681190372.jpg"/&gt;

III. HARD WIRED by Len Vlahos: A 15 year old discovers the truth behind bizarre dysfunction of the world around him: he's an AI in a sim, and the guy he thinks of as his long-dead father is actually the research scientists who created him.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/31/ai-rights-now/#len-vlahos"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/31/ai-rights-now/#len-vlahos&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/AdvofaDwergishGirlNW-731x1180.jpg"/&gt;

IV. ADVENTURES OF A DWERGISH GIRL, by Daniel Pinkwater: Like every Pinkwater novel, it defies description, it is brilliant, and it is his best to date. Ghosts, Revolutionary War fleshbots, papaya juice, and supernatural beings from the Catskills!

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/25/dwergish-girl/#you-are-a-pickle"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/25/dwergish-girl/#you-are-a-pickle&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781838935610.jpg"/&gt;

V. WITCH by Finbar Hawkins: A beautiful debut novel about a pair of 17th century sisters who avenge themselves against the witchfinders that murdered their mother. A superbly told historical.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/01/the-years-of-repair/#witch"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/01/the-years-of-repair/#witch&lt;/a&gt;

FINALLY: I published &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; books in 2020!

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781626723627.jpg"/&gt;

I. POESY THE MONSTER SLAYER: My debut picture book, about a little girl who turns her toys into weapons and torments her parents by hunting monsters all night, with wonderful art by Matt Rockefeller:

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781626723627"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781626723627&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781250774583.jpg"/&gt;

II. LITTLE BROTHER/HOMELAND: My multibestselling YA novels were reissued last summer in a gorgeous package with a (fantastic) new introduction by Snowden.

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250774583"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250774583&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781250757531.jpg"/&gt;

III. ATTACK SURFACE: A standalone, adult sequel to Little Brother and Homeland. The New York Times called it "vocal and unflinching" and "ultimately optimistic"; the Washington Post called it a "riveting techno-thriller."

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757531"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757531&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/survcap.gif"/&gt;

IV. HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM: A long pamphlet/short book that makes the case that Big Tech manipulates us and spies on us because they have monopolies - not because they've developed devastating, data-driven mind-control.

&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Armed cops terrorize Florida covid whistleblower (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#rebekah-jones"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When covid struck Florida, Rebekah Jones - a data scientist working for the state - created a dashboard to help people in the state follow the disease's spread as Republican Governor Ron DeSantis lifted restrictions and declared the state open for business.

DeSantis insisted that lifting restrictions was working fine, but the data told a different story. In June, the state fired Jones after she refused to manipulate the data to maintain the pretense that DeSantis's plan wasn't slaughtering Floridians.

&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884551391/florida-scientist-says-she-was-fired-for-not-manipulating-covid-19-data"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884551391/florida-scientist-says-she-was-fired-for-not-manipulating-covid-19-data&lt;/a&gt;

Jones was undaunted: she set up Florida Covid Action, an independent dashboard that revealed the real case-counts and mortality in counterpoint to the state's official story.

&lt;a href="https://floridacovidaction.com/Fl"&gt;https://floridacovidaction.com/Fl&lt;/a&gt;

But yesterday morning, DeSantis turned the heat up: he sent armed police to Jones's home to seize her computers and devices, cops who entered with guns drawn, who aimed them at her small children:

&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201207/14591845837/florida-state-police-raid-home-covid-whistleblower-point-guns-her-her-family-seize-all-her-computer-equipment.shtml"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201207/14591845837/florida-state-police-raid-home-covid-whistleblower-point-guns-her-her-family-seize-all-her-computer-equipment.shtml&lt;/a&gt;

They accused Jones of having used her old login credentials to send a bulk-message to state workers urging them to come forward to blow the whistle on data-manipulation by the state.

&lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article247680010.html"&gt;https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article247680010.html&lt;/a&gt;

If you know anything about IT, you may be asking how it is that they could have fired Jones but left her with the capability to send such messages? According to the state's affidavit, "All authorized users use the same user name and password."

&lt;a href="https://amp.tallahassee.com/amp/6482817002"&gt;https://amp.tallahassee.com/amp/6482817002&lt;/a&gt;

(Jones categorically denies sending the message.)

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CuomoPrimeTime/status/1336157469622538240"&gt;https://twitter.com/CuomoPrimeTime/status/1336157469622538240&lt;/a&gt;

Jones posted videos of the police aiming firearms at her and her small children as they seized her systems.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336065787900145665"&gt;https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336065787900145665&lt;/a&gt;

She speculates that the real target of the warrant was her correspondence with former colleagues in the state who wrote to her for advice on blowing the whistle.

One of the books I reviewed in 2020 was Tim Schwartz's "A Public Service" - a comprehensive guide to whistleblower safety. If you are part of a whistleblowing project - as a leaker, advisor or reporter - it's an essential read.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/a-public-service-a-comprehensive-comprehensible-guide-to-leaking-documents-to-journalists-and-public-service-groups-without-getting-caught/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/a-public-service-a-comprehensive-comprehensible-guide-to-leaking-documents-to-journalists-and-public-service-groups-without-getting-caught/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Uber pays to get rid of its self-driving cars (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#goober"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When they write the history of this era, one of the strangest chapters will be devoted to Uber, a company that was never, ever going to be profitable, which existed solely to launder billions for the Saudi royals.

From the start, Uber's "blitzscaling" strategy involved breaking local taxi laws (incurring potentially unlimited civil liability) while losing (lots of) money on every ride. They flushed billions and billions and billions of dollars down the drain.

But they had billions to burn. Mohammed bin Salman, the murdering Crown Prince of the Saudi royal family, funded Softbank - a Japanese pump-and-dump investment scheme behind Wework and other grifts - with $80B as part of his "Vision 2030" plan.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/24/zawinskiian-carcination/#gusher"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/24/zawinskiian-carcination/#gusher&lt;/a&gt;

Vision 2030 is a scheme to diversify Saudi wealth away from hydrocarbons by attempting to establish monopolies that will allow the family to control entire sectors of the global economy.

These schemes are longshots, and the fallback position is to unload failed monopolies - with staggering debt-overhangs - on investors who've been suckered with the promise that really big piles of shit surely have a pony buried underneath them somewhere.

That's what happened with Uber's IPO, of course - Softbank and Mister Bone Saw made out like bandits and Uber now lumbers on under the ownership of problem gamblers who read the company's S1 and bought in anyway.

The S1 - the document that explains how the company plans to be profitable - set two conditions for Uber's profitability.

First, all the public transit in the world had to shut down and be replaced by Uber.

Next, all the drivers had to be replaced by AIs.

Needless to say, neither of these things were ever going to happen. Public transit is definitely in trouble after the pandemic, but we're not gonna replace it all with Ubers.

And self-driving cars? Please.

Back in September, it became clear that Uber's self-driving car labs were just window-dressing for the con. After spending $2.5B on the cars, they'd come up with vehicles that could crawl half a mile before losing their minds.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/30/death-to-all-monopoly/#pogo-stick-problem"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/30/death-to-all-monopoly/#pogo-stick-problem&lt;/a&gt;

(Of course, self-driving car huxters have an answer to this: they argue that since cars can't cope with unpredictable human conduct, we should just ban humans from acting unpredictably around their murderbots)

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530232/self-driving-ai-winter-full-autonomy-waymo-tesla-uber"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530232/self-driving-ai-winter-full-autonomy-waymo-tesla-uber&lt;/a&gt;

Every long con needs a "store" - a place where the con plays out, like a fake betting shop where the scammers rope in the mark and fleece them of every dime. But once the con is done, the store has to shut down amid a "blow-off" that lets the grifters escape.

Uber's shutting down the AV part of its store: they "sold" the division to a startup called Aurora, but the "sale" involves Uber "investing" $400,000,000 in Aurora. That is, they've paid someone else to take this bit of set-dressing off their hands.

If you want to learn more about how Uber will never, never, ever, ever be a real business, be sure to tap into transport economist Hubert Horan's series on the company, which he calls a "bezzle."

&lt;h1&gt;Email sabbaticals (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#email-sabbatical"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

It's been a decade since danah boyd introduced me to the idea of "email sabbaticals." That's when you go away and turn off your email.

&lt;a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html"&gt;http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html&lt;/a&gt;

Not just setting an out-of-office message, but rather deleting all inbound mail and asking correspondents to try again after the break. In her message, boyd explains to those correspondents who know how to reach her mother that this is the only way to reach her.

Here's the rationale: if you allow email to pile up while you're trying to unwind, it'll take months to catch up on when you get back, and you'll immediately burn out, incinerating all the value you got out of your break.

What's more, you'll still fail to clear the backlog - you'll have to declare "email bankruptcy" and fail everyone who'd contacted you anyway. It's a bad deal for you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; for the people who email you during your break.

Here's how boyd's email sabbaticals work: six months prior, she informs her collaborators that she'll be taking some protracted downtime; a month before she confirms her commitments to collaborators and composes a checklist to ensure that she meets them prior to departure.

A week in advance, she warns everyone again that she's going offline and shuttering her inboxes. Close family members and her network administrator are given instructions for reaching her while on break, but no one else is.

She leaves, and shuts down her email. She knows she's going to miss new, time-sensitive stuff, but makes peace with it. In return, she gets the peace of mind that comes from knowing that she's going to come home to an empty in-box.

At the close of business today, I'm going on email (and work) sabbatical until Jan 4, 2021. Apart from one live event (the remote Chaos Communications Congress on Dec 27) I won't be accepting emails and I won't be replying to DMs or other messages.

&lt;a href="https://rc3.world/"&gt;https://rc3.world/&lt;/a&gt;

I really, really need it.

Over the years, many people have expressed their admiration at my "productivity" - but the dirty secret of that productivity is that work is how I cope with stress.

It's not the worst problem to have: I wrote a whole novel since the crisis, while also launching four books and keeping up with my day-job at EFF.

But working to cope with stress has its limits. It's a good temporary fix, but it's no long-term solution.

For one thing, I've got a serious, untreatable, degenerating chronic pain condition, and working is how I hope with the pain, too - distraction works far better than any prescription meds for me.

But ignoring your body's pain signals is a dangerous tactic. It's why I'm now experiencing the worst continuous pain of my adult life (it's been a stressful year). Last week it was so bad I was walking with a cane.

I say all of this not to humblebrag about my commitment to my work, but rather in the interests of transparency. I'm keenly aware that we live our own blooper reels and everyone else's highlight reels.

I'm grateful for my work habits, truly - but they come at a really high cost, and balancing work-as-distraction and work-as-pathology is really, really hard. If you're wondering how to do what I do, have a little peek into the blooper reel, first.

It's been a high-stress, crazy year. We nearly went broke, then had a spectacular recovery (thank you, Kickstarter backers!), have tried our best to be good parents (with varying degrees of success). We've gone through blazing rows and many sleepless nights.

I've spent most of the year with sores at the corners of my mouth, which I only get under in the most extreme times of stress.

And we've had it &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. We're solvent, safe, and healthy. Thinking about what this would be like if any of those changed is terrifying.

Hanging out with my digital community is a huge net benefit to me, but unplugging from that community is something I increasingly value as I head towards my 50th birthday next July.

My first digital community experience was sending IMs to other users of the timeshare mainframe we plugged into when I was six years old, in 1977, when my dad brought home an acoustic coupler and my mom found 1,000' of brown paper towel to feed into the teletype.

Some (most) of my life's most important relationships, friendships, and discussions have taken place over this medium, and an enormous amount of that good stuff started with a conversation with a stranger.

I never felt the outrage that attended the introduction of the telephone into Edwardian England: "Anyone -- any wild fool off the street -- could simply barge bellowing into one's office or home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell."

&lt;a href="https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html"&gt;https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html&lt;/a&gt;

For me, finding my people (and being found by them) has been the highlight of my half-century. Touring and speaking turned these digital relationships into personal ones.

But: moderation in all things. I'm writing four of these threads this morning, doing a couple interviews and meetings, and then putting my lid down until 2021 (save for a brief dial-in to CCC on the 27th).

I'm going to swim in our lovely outdoor public pool, which, thankfully, has figured out how to remain open during the pandemic. I'm going read in the backyard hammock and hike in Griffith Park.

I'm not going to answer - or accept - email while I'm gone.

And I say all of this because it's taken a decade for me to really understand what danah was getting at (she's a very smart person and I often benefit from reflecting on our conversations).

And also, to show you a bit of the blooper reel. Coping strategies are great and necessary, but they're no substitute for addressing the underlying problems. I'm proud of the work I do, but I'm also still learning how to do it right.

&lt;h1&gt;Chaos Communications Congress (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#rc3"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

I'm about to go offline until 2021 and I had planned to do &lt;em&gt;absolutely no work of any sort&lt;/em&gt; while on break, but I made an exception, for an exceptional opportunity: the 32nd Chaos Communications Congress, which is remote this year.

&lt;a href="https://rc3.world/"&gt;https://rc3.world/&lt;/a&gt;

CCC is - notoriously - held during Christmas week, which means that the attendees are limited to people who either care about tech policy and security more than their families, or people who can talk their families into coming along.

It's one of the best events I've ever attended (I brought my family along). My talk at that event, "The Coming War on General Purpose Computing," has had a long afterlife, in large part because of the kind and thoughtful reactions of the attendees.

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg&lt;/a&gt;

I've been trying to get back ever since but haven't managed it - until this year. RC3 (the first all-remote CCC) has invited me to speak on Dec 27.

I'm doing two back-to-back events: a talk called "What the cyberoptimists got wrong - and what to do about it" then a "fireside chat" (a reading from my book ATTACK SURFACE followed by a Q&amp;amp;A;).

They're back-to-back, starting at 10AM Pacific (7PM CET) and running to 12/9PM.

The tickets are currently sold out, but they've mooted releasing another block. If you're attending, I hope you'll consider tuning into my talk (and of course, as with all CCC talks, these will be online shortly thereafter for public viewing).

&lt;a name="financial-secrecy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/HandsomeVariableGalapagosalbatross-max-1mb.gif"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Landmark US financial transparency law (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#financial-secrecy"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, Swissleaks, Luxembourg Leaks, the Fincen Files - the past decade has been filled with financial secrecy scandals wherein we learned how the world's worst people hide the world's dirtiest money.

Governments have fallen as a result of these leaks. Journalists have been murdered for reporting them, whistleblowers have been imprisoned for telling the truth. These are a high-stakes window on the corruption, self-dealing and viciousness of the 1% and their criminal pals.

One critical revelation is the role that "onshort-offshore" plays in money-laundering: rich countries with a reputation for a strong rule of law and good governance are the lynchpin of global financial secrecy, thanks to lax corporate enforcement.

Money laundering, tax-evasion, bribery and other finance crimes were only possible because places like New Zealand, the City of London, Scotland, and US tax-havens like Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming knowingly abetted them.

Anti-financial-secrecy campaigners have made major progress in shutting down onshore-offshore havens, and now they've scored a massive victory in the USA, with the inclusion of an anti-money-laundering amendment to the defense bill.

&lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/advocates-celebrate-major-us-anti-money-laundering-victory/"&gt;https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/advocates-celebrate-major-us-anti-money-laundering-victory/&lt;/a&gt;

It's a must-pass bill, and there's always intense jockeying to attach other legislation to it, virtually guaranteeing its passage (this is not always a good thing: Trump wants terrible, dangerous changes to internet law included in the bill):

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/its-not-section-230-president-trump-hates-its-first-amendment"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/its-not-section-230-president-trump-hates-its-first-amendment&lt;/a&gt;

The Corporate Transparency Act requires that all US companies report their true owners to the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen). This will make Fincen investigations vastly cheaper...and more effective.

It's got strong bipartisan support, and is the culmination of a decade of debate, consultation and coalition-building. It passed the House and Senate with a nominally veto-proof majority.

That doesn't mean it will pass. Trump has threatened to veto it, and many GOP lickspittles in both houses have vowed to back the president if he overturns their vote.

Even if that happens, it seems likely that the Corporate Transparency Act will pass as standalone legislation - its support comes from all quarters, from the Chamber of Commerce to Friends of the Earth, from Transparency International to Dow Chemicals.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Rogues_gallery.jpeg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Rogues' Galleries and facial recognition (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#fr"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Cities - and even states - across the USA have passed laws banning the use of facial recognition technology by governments; the most-often cited concern is surveillance and its ability to chill lawful conduct like protests.

But as my EFF colleague Matthew Guariglia writes for Slate Future Tense, the risks run deeper than that, as historic debates have shown us. The early 20th century saw debates over "rogues galleries" (police files of photos of criminals and suspects).

&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/rogues-gallery-facial-recognition-technology-history.html"&gt;https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/rogues-gallery-facial-recognition-technology-history.html&lt;/a&gt;

As Guariglia writes, "Suspicion is a circular process." In theory you got put into a Rogues Gallery because you were suspicious. In practice, being in a Rogues Gallery &lt;em&gt;made you&lt;/em&gt; suspicious. A single photo taken after a single police encounter turned into an eternal accusation.

It meant your innocence would be called into question every time a crime was committed, with cops walking through a Rogues Gallery to find their likeliest suspects. An officer's decision to haul you in - often due to overt or unconscious bias - meant a lifetime of suspicion.

In 1899 Jacob "Doc" Owens - a cheating gambler - went to the NY Supreme Court to have his picture taken out of the NYC Rogues Gallery. He failed, but the national debate he spurred never died down.

In 1909, 19 year old George B Duffy was arrested for robbery in NYC. It was a bullshit charge, later reduced by the embarrassed NYPD to "obstructing the sidewalk."

Duffy's father began campaigning to have his face removed from the Rogues Gallery.

The campaign sparked national press coverage deploring the eternal suspicion cast over those who had a bad interaction with a cop. NYC's mayor overrode the police commissioner, had the photo destroyed, and demanded the commissioner's resignation.

These debates echo through the decade, as we fight over facial recognition: "while people no longer laugh and sneer at people whose faces hang in the police station, they can be denied jobs or passports because of misreadings or misunderstandings buried in hoarded data."

Guariglia: "the fundamental and historical truth is that face recognition means we are all constantly under suspicion. We’re all in the rogues’ gallery now."

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;a name="public-domain-day"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/2021-montage2.jpeg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jan 1 is Public Domain Day for 1925 (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#public-domain-day"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

1998's Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act extended US copyrights by 20 years to life-plus-70 for human authors and 95 years total for corporate authors. The extension was retrospective, so works in the public domain went back into copyright.

This was a wanton act of violence that doomed much of our culture to disappear entirely before its copyright expired, allowing it to be used and revitalized, rewoven into our cultural fabric.

It was undertaken to extract extra revenues for the minuscule fraction of works by long-dead authors that were still generating revenues. It also froze the US public domain for two decades, with no work re-entering our public domain until Jan 1 2018.

That day - the Grand Reopening of the Public Domain - marked the entry of the collected works of 1923 into the public domain. Last Jan saw the liberation of 1924's catalog:

&lt;a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/12/13/the-public-domain-line-is-moving-again-one-year-later/"&gt;https://blog.archive.org/2019/12/13/the-public-domain-line-is-moving-again-one-year-later/&lt;/a&gt;

And now, it's about to happen again. Every year, Duke University's James Boyle and Jennifer Jenkins document the treasures we are about to receive. 1925 is a bumper crop:

&lt;a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2021/"&gt;https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2021/&lt;/a&gt;

We're getting The Great Gatsby &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Fats Waller; Woolf's Mrs Galloway and Hemingway's In Our Time; we're getting the Harlem Renaissance's peak, and the first year of The New Yorker. It's a good year!

(yeah, Mein Kampf is in there too)

Here's some highlights from the list:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Dos Passos, Manhattan Transfer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alain Locke, The New Negro (collecting works from writers including W.E.B. du Bois, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, and Eric Walrond)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair Lewis, Arrowsmith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agatha Christie, The Secret of Chimneys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aldous Huxley, Those Barren Leaves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Merry Widow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buster Keaton’s Go West&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always, by Irving Berlin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet Georgia Brown, by Ben Bernie, Maceo Pinkard &amp;amp; Kenneth Casey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by ‘Jelly Roll’ Morton, including Shreveport Stomps and Milenberg Joys (with Paul Mares, Walter Melrose, &amp;amp; Leon Roppolo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by Duke Ellington, including Jig Walk and With You (both with Joseph “Jo” Trent)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by ‘Fats’ Waller, including Anybody Here Want To Try My Cabbage (with Andrea “Andy” Razaf), Ball and Chain Blues (with Andrea “Andy” Razaf), and Campmeetin’ Stomp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by Bessie Smith, the “Empress of the Blues,” including Dixie Flyer Blues, Tired of Voting Blues, and Telephone Blues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by Sidney Bechet, including Waltz of Love (with Spencer Williams), Naggin’ at Me (with Rousseau Simmons), and Dreams of To-morrow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these works and more will be available at Internet Archive on Jan 1. Get ready!

&lt;h1&gt;Into the breach (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/07/revolutionary-colossus/#selective-incompetence"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

US law enforcement has literal centuries of shameful history of infiltrating and spying on politically disfavored activist groups, from trade unionists to suffragists to abolitionists to civil rights advocates to antiwar advocates.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/kingfbi.jpg"/&gt;

Long before Cointelpro, federal agencies were intercepting communications and embedding as provocateurs in radical political movements, often with the help of mercenary "contractors" like the Pinkertons. The digital age only ramped up this public-private surveillance.

The Dakota Access Pipeline protests were infiltrated and surveilled by beltway bandits who billed the US taxpayer handsomely for the service.

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/12/30/tigerswan-infiltrator-dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2018/12/30/tigerswan-infiltrator-dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock/&lt;/a&gt;

2020's BLM uprising was subjected to the full array of military and national intelligence surveillance: drones, IMSI catchers, mass interception, infiltrators, wiretaps, "reverse warrants" to recover location data from Big Tech monopolists and more.

&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/police-surveillance-of-black-lives-matter-shows-the-danger-technology-poses-to-democracy-142194"&gt;https://theconversation.com/police-surveillance-of-black-lives-matter-shows-the-danger-technology-poses-to-democracy-142194&lt;/a&gt;

And yet, federal and local agencies were seemingly totally unprepared for a mob of thousands of armed terrorists who stormed the capitol, disrupted the transition of presidential power, and threatened the lives of US legislators as well as the integrity of state documents.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/proudboys_WTF.jpeg"/&gt;

The thing is, the plans were in plain sight. For weeks, I've been seeing screengrabs from far-right forums that leaked onto public social media in which violent psychopaths laid out detailed plans to commit murder and overthrow the government.

I wasn't even looking for this stuff. I was on vacation and only cursorily checking the internet. But it was obvious. How obvious? Well, the President was the keynote speaker at the riot and he openly called for violent insurrection. That might have tipped the cops off.

Since 1999's Battle of Seattle, cops have acted like pants-wetting cowards at the first whiff of protest.

2017's plan for dozens of paralyzed, wheelchair-using Medicare For All activists to peacefully occupy the capitol begat violent police panic.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarkAgee/status/1346904850886397954"&gt;https://twitter.com/MarkAgee/status/1346904850886397954&lt;/a&gt;

But when armed terrorists followed through on their widely proclaimed plan to invade the capitol building yesterday, law enforcement foundered. They weren't just unprepared to stop terrorists for breaking in, they were also unprepared to deal with them after the break-in.

To get a visceral sense of the shitshow, listen to Ryan Grim's interview with Matt Fuller, recorded while Fuller was hiding in a secret bunker with other Congressional reporters, Members of Congress and their staffers.

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/07/deconstructed-capitol-inside-the-insurrection/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2021/01/07/deconstructed-capitol-inside-the-insurrection/&lt;/a&gt;

There's a lot of fingerpointing today between the agencies, with a starring role for the US Capitol Police, who get $460m/yr (10% of Congress's total budget) and have demanded a stonking increase for 2021.

&lt;a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0107/Lawmakers-vow-a-probe-into-Capitol-Police-for-breach-by-mob"&gt;https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0107/Lawmakers-vow-a-probe-into-Capitol-Police-for-breach-by-mob&lt;/a&gt;

They definitely have some serious questions to answer (including why their officers posed for selfies and seem to have opened the gates to permit terrorists to storm the building).

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1347054783333625857"&gt;https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1347054783333625857&lt;/a&gt;

But as Neal Stephenson pointed out in his 1994 comic technothriller masterpiece INTERFACE, DC is a "cop zoo" with literally hundreds of different law enforcement agencies operating in its city limits.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2007/12/10/interface-neal-stephensons-underappreciated-masterpiece/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2007/12/10/interface-neal-stephensons-underappreciated-masterpiece/&lt;/a&gt;

Did none of these agencies see the terrorist plan that had been scrawled in 100' tall flaming letters across the internet? How could they be caught this flatfooted?

From: Propublica: "a thin line of U.S. Capitol Police, with only a few riot shields between them...struggled with a flimsy set of barricades as a mob in helmets and bulletproof vests pushed its way toward the Capitol entrance."

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/capitol-rioters-planned-for-weeks-in-plain-sight-the-police-werent-ready"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/capitol-rioters-planned-for-weeks-in-plain-sight-the-police-werent-ready&lt;/a&gt;

In her excellent Naked Capitalism roundup of yesterday's failures, Yves Smith examines the logical conclusion that the police were on the terrorists' side. After all, police unions and officers rallied for and endorsed Trump. Would they support a coup to keep him in power?

&lt;a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/01/maga-cosplayers-seize-capitol-while-cops-flounder.html"&gt;https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/01/maga-cosplayers-seize-capitol-while-cops-flounder.html&lt;/a&gt;

Biden is no defund-the-police radical. He pledged to &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; cop funding by 10%.

But Trump doesn't just promise money for cops: his offer is total impunity. Remember when he told police they should deliberately brutalize people during arrests?

&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-police-nice-suspects/story?id=48914504"&gt;https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-police-nice-suspects/story?id=48914504&lt;/a&gt;

US policing has its origin in "slave patrols" that abetted enslavers by kidnapping Black people and forcing them into slavery. Slave patrols' legacy lives on in modern policing, with US police forces riddled with white nationalist terror supporters:

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/the-fbi-has-quietly-investigated-white-supremacist-infiltration-of-law-enforcement/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/the-fbi-has-quietly-investigated-white-supremacist-infiltration-of-law-enforcement/&lt;/a&gt;

Trump himself is a white nationalist. A significant proportion of US police might be tempted to abet a coup to perpetuate the rule of a despot who promises them a free hand to torture and brutalize, and who backs white supremacy.

The failure of US law enforcement to prevent yesterday's botched coup will have long-term, ongoing consequences. While most of the terrorists were Qanon-addled fools, it's impossible to rule out some of them being sophisticated enough to attack the Capitol's IT systems.

Resecuring the Capitol's IT infrastructure should probably involve shredding every device, cable and thumb-drive, tearing open every light-socket and power-outlet, and even then, it will be hard to fully trust the building and its systems.

My 2020 novel ATTACK SURFACE has a B-plot that closely tracks yesterday's attacks; complicity between far-right insurrectionists and palace guards, and massive breaches of official covert IT systems after the government falls.

&lt;a href="http://attacksurface.com"&gt;http://attacksurface.com&lt;/a&gt;

I'm not the only one who fictionalizes attacks like this. Within hours of the attacks, right wing conspiratorialists were calling it a false flag and describing their colleagues in the videos as secret antifa infiltrators.

The narrative aftermath of this is gonna be &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;.

Take the War of 1812. Many commentators have invoked that war - in which enemy forces burned down the White House - in discussing yesterday's assault. But what most Americans don't know is that they are told a highly parochial version of that war-story.

Americans think the War of 1812 was fought with the British, and that the US won. Meanwhile, Canadians believe that the War of 1812 was fought between the US and &lt;em&gt;Canada&lt;/em&gt;, and that &lt;em&gt;Canada&lt;/em&gt; won.

Indeed, we have delightful comic folksongs that celebrate the burning of the White House by victorious Canadian troops:

&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/aue-zWxYtEc"&gt;https://youtu.be/aue-zWxYtEc&lt;/a&gt;

And the White House burned, burned, burned
And we're the one's that did it!
It burned, burned, burned
While the president ran and cried
It burned, burned, burned
And things were very historical
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies
Waa waa waah!

Can you imagine the story the descendants of Qanon believers will be telling themselves of yesterday's attack in a century or two?

&lt;h1&gt;Revolutionary Colossus (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/07/revolutionary-colossus/#1776"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

A timely post in today's Public Domain Review brings us the storied history of "The Revolutionary Colossus," a recurring image of "a king-eating colossus" that spread widely and in many forms during the French Revolution.

&lt;a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/revolutionary-colossus"&gt;https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/revolutionary-colossus&lt;/a&gt;

One classic depiction comes from Erasmus Darwin (Charles Darwin's grampa) in "The Economy of Vegetation" a poem in 1791's "The Botanic Garden."

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Long had the Giant-form on GALLIA’S plains
Inglorious slept, unconscious of his chains;
Round his large limbs were wound a thousand strings
By the weak hands of Confessors and Kings;
O’er his closed eyes a triple veil was bound,
And steely rivets lock’d him to the ground;
While stern Bastile with iron cage inthralls
His folded limbs, and hems in marble walls.
Touch’d by the patriot-flame, he rent amazed
The flimsy bonds, and round and round him gazed;
Starts up from earth, above the admiring throng
Lifts his Colossal form, and towers along;
High o’er his foes his hundred arms He rears,
Plowshares his swords, and pruning hooks his spears;
Calls to the Good and Brave with voice, that rolls
Like Heaven’s own thunder round the echoing poles;
Gives to the winds his banner broad unfurl’d,
And gathers in its shade the living world!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Or as Samantha Wesner summarizes it for we poesie-impaired types: "Between thick dungeon walls, a giant lies asleep. He’s chained to the ground, large limbs folded, enmeshed in a web of ropes, a blindfold over his closed eyes. Suddenly, as if touched by a flame, he awakes, and gazes around in amazement. He starts up, shreds the ropes entangling him, breaks chains, smashes walls, and rises to his feet. Towering over the world, shadow stretching out below, he calls out with a voice like thunder."

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/image_villeneuve_le_peuple_francais_terrassant_lhydre_du_federalisme-edit.jpeg"/&gt;

While the poetic invocations of the colossus are quite stirring, they're not a patch on the imagery, like Villeneuve's 1790 engraving, "The French People Overwhelming the Hydra of Federalism."

&lt;a href="https://www.parismuseescollections.paris.fr/fr/musee-carnavalet/oeuvres/le-peuple-francais-terrassant-l-hydre-du-federalisme#infos-principales"&gt;https://www.parismuseescollections.paris.fr/fr/musee-carnavalet/oeuvres/le-peuple-francais-terrassant-l-hydre-du-federalisme#infos-principales&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Le_Peuple_mangeur_de_rois-edit.jpeg"/&gt;

Or 1793's "The People, King-Eater," whose artist is lost to the mists of time:

&lt;a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b84120711?rk=21459;2#"&gt;https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b84120711?rk=21459;2#&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/581px-Leviathan_-_Hobbes'_Leviathan_(1651),_title_page_-_BL.jpeg"/&gt;

The Colossus is a lineal descendant of the image of Hobbes's Leviathan, a 1651 image that is so striking it is still widespread today.

&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leviathan_-_Hobbes%27_Leviathan_(1651),_title_page_-_BL.jpg"&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leviathan_-&lt;em&gt;Hobbes%27_Leviathan&lt;/em&gt;(1651),&lt;em&gt;title_page&lt;/em&gt;-_BL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/destruction-of-french-colossus.jpeg"/&gt;

Visually, though, the most contemporary Colossus comes from British caricaturist James Gillray, whose 1794 lampoon of the French Revolution and the Terror is straight out of EC Comics (or vice-versa) (obviously).

&lt;a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b6948829p?rk=236052;4#"&gt;https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b6948829p?rk=236052;4#&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Les_Formes_acerbes___cette-edit-2.jpeg"/&gt;

It wasn't just foreign enemies of the Republic who appropriated the Colossus for political ends: French reactionaries like Poirier de Dunckerque made king-eating into an act of monstrous cannibalism.

&lt;a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b6950397k/f1.item.r=Les%20Formes%20acerbes.zoom"&gt;https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b6950397k/f1.item.r=Les%20Formes%20acerbes.zoom&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/23218465551_a70d44f5f9_b.jpeg"/&gt;

The image found its way into the public imagination as a depiction of the doubl-edged sword of revolutions, with a Colossus-descended Frankenstein's monster  engraged on the frontispiece of Shelley's MODERN PROMETHEUS in 1831.

&lt;a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/p67zzz4d?wellcomeImagesUrl=/indexplus/image/L0027125.html"&gt;https://wellcomecollection.org/works/p67zzz4d?wellcomeImagesUrl=/indexplus/image/L0027125.html&lt;/a&gt;

Wesner: "Placing the revolutionary Colossi in a genealogy that stretches from Darwin’s Bastille giant through to Frankenstein’s horrific creature invites us to consider the particular emotional register within which each appears...

"If for Darwin, revolution could be allegorized to the electrified awakening of an embodied Third Estate, then Frankenstein allegorizes a revolution stripped of both its epic scale and its promise. Our attention shifts from the patriot-flame and the Colossus to the 'modern Prometheus' of Shelley’s subtitle, who gave fire to mankind and lived to regret it."

&lt;h1&gt;Fighting fiber was the right's dumbest self-own (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/17/turner-diaries-fanfic/#1a-fiber"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

With the deplatforming of forums where trumpists and right-wing figures congregate, there's a lot of chatter about whether and when private entities have the right to remove speech, and what obligations come with scale.

The most important - and overlooked - area of this discourse is the role that monopoly plays, and the role that anti-monopoly enforcement could play.

In short, the fact that being removed from Twitter and the app stores and Facebook and Amazon is so devastating is best addressed by weakening those companies by spreading out our digital life onto lots of platforms.

Not by strengthening them by giving them formal duties to either carry or remove speech based on its content. These duties will justify all kinds of anticompetitive activity, because only a very profitable company can afford to fulfil them.

It also turns the same companies that failed horribly to craft and uphold moderation standards into private-sector arms of powerful state actors (like domestic surveillance agencies) who defend their right to monopolize the digital sphere as necessary for national security.

(Recall that the Pentagon intervened in the DoJ's breakup of AT&amp;amp;T in the 1950s, successfully arguing for a stay of execution on the grounds that the Korean War could not be effectively persecuted without AT&amp;amp;T's help - the company stayed intact for 30 years after that)

Competition in the platforms is important, but it's not the whole story. The First Amendment was drafted for newspapers, and most contemporary communications law comes from broadcast and cable regulation. The internet is not a newspaper or a TV station, after all.

The discussion of the difference between the American revolutionary era (or the heyday of broadcast TV) and the present moment focuses on technology, but there's a much more important difference to take account of: the presence or absence of a public sphere.

The First Amendment contemplates both a diversity of speech forums (newspapers, cafes, halls) alongside of public spaces that are &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; public, owned by the people through their governments and tightly bound by 1A as to when and whether rules about speech can be enforced.

So if the Masonic Lodge won't let you give a speech from its stage, and the cafe throws you out for arguing, and the newspaper won't let you publish an op-ed, you can stand outside of those establishments with a sign or a bullhorn, leafleting and speaking your piece.

The government can still restrict your speech on the public sidewalk or in a public park, but not according to its content - only according to "time and manner" (for example, enforcing a noise ordinance after 9PM or ticketing you for blocking traffic).

The biggest difference between a world where we are locked indoors and connect to one another via the internet and the world we left behind is that there are &lt;em&gt;no public spaces&lt;/em&gt; on the internet.

If a cafe kicks you out for your speech, you can picket the public right of way out front. If Twitter kicks you out for your views, you have no constitutionally guaranteed right to stand at its digital threshold and tell everyone who enters or leaves that you got a raw deal.

Now, the state provision of digital services isn't an unmitigated good. US governments at all levels have proven themselves to be utterly surveillance-addled, in thrall to the fallacy that spying on everyone will make us all safer.

But surveillance fears aren't why we lack democratically controlled tech. For that, you can thank the same right wingers who are so exercised about deplatforming today, who, for a decade, have been the useful idiots of telcoms monopolists in the fight over public broadband.

American cable and telco monopolists have divided up the country so that the best most of us can hope for is a duopoly, while many others are burdened with monopoly carriers, and millions live in broadband deserts with no high-speed internet at all.

The poorer you are, the more your broadband costs and the worse it is. The more rural you are, the worse your broadband is and the more it costs. Homeowners with good broadband see their assets appreciate. If your home is outside a monopolist's profit zone, its price drops.

The internet barons like it that way. When Frontier went bankrupt last year, we got to see its internal docs. Guess what? If you have no choice other than Frontier, it treats you as an "asset" because you will pay more for worse service.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/frontiers-bankruptcy-reveals-cynical-choice-deny-profitable-fiber-millions"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/frontiers-bankruptcy-reveals-cynical-choice-deny-profitable-fiber-millions&lt;/a&gt;

Frontier cares about its share price (its execs are mostly paid in stock, not cash), and share prices are rigged by influential analysts who downrank any company that makes a capital expenditure that takes more than five years to pay off.

That's why Frontier decided to walk away from the $800,000,000 in profits it would realize on a ten-year investment in fiber for three million households who currently make do with Frontier's failing copper network, which often consists of wires draped over trees.

We've been here before. For decades, you had to live in an urban, affluent area to get electricity; your country cousins burned coal for dinner and used oil-lamps to read by. The New Deal electrified the nation, extending universal service regardless of the business-case.

Electricity became a human right, and the US government extended it across the nation (though structural racism meant that it arrived late for majority Black settlements).

Long before covid, underserved towns realized that their very existence depended on decent broadband.

The initial experiments with municipal fiber were incredible, jaw-dropping successes. Towns that invested in fiber saw a vast expansion of job opportunities, access to global information and services, and new blood from telecommuters who relocated from big cities.

The telcos fucking hated this. How can you sell flaky access to copper wires draped over shrubs for $80/month when the city is wiring people up to networks that are &lt;em&gt;1,000-100,000 times faster&lt;/em&gt; at a lower price?

In a competitive market, companies would have improved service and lowered prices to compete. Luckily (for monopolists), there's a cheaper solution: buy off state legislatures so they pass laws banning municipal broadband.

These laws were promulgated to GOP-dominated statehouses across the country, passed by right wing lawmakers who told their constituents they were "keeping government out of the internet."

This is a line that their footsoldiers dutifully parroted during the Obama years, then signed up to Trump FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's order that reversed a late-term-Obama FCC order banning state laws that interfered with municipal fiber projects.

Unfortunately (for the right), reality has a well-known left-wing bias. 700+ US towns and cities have municipal fiber. They are the only Americans who consistently express satisfaction with their ISPs. Most of these towns vote Republican!

&lt;a href="https://muninetworks.org/communitymap"&gt;https://muninetworks.org/communitymap&lt;/a&gt;

Woe betide the rural "red" town that lacks municipal fiber. These have been mostly abandoned by cable companies, so their cable/DSL duopoly has become a DSL monopoly, with prices rising and quality of service falling.

&lt;a href="https://ilsr.org/monopoly-networks/"&gt;https://ilsr.org/monopoly-networks/&lt;/a&gt;

Which brings me back to the First Amendment and public sidewalks. All those people who are trying to find a way to support the "free market†" and also justify demanding that dominant platforms be ordered to carry their speech are living in a hell of their own making.

†Adam Smith popularized the term "free markets" to describe markets free from "rentiers" who collect money without adding value...such as cable monopolists. He &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; didn't mean "markets free from government regulation."

Because here's the thing: your ISP - and Twitter, and Facebook, and Amazon - is a private company. It is not subject to the First Amendment. It can have any rules it wants about which lawful speech it will tolerate. It can sling your ass out the door on a whim.

You know who's bound by the First Amendment? You know who can't suppress your speech based on its content? You know who has to answer public records requests about why you got booted out of its service?

Your local government.

If you had a $70/month, 100GB fiber in your rural house, you could run a kickass P2P messaging server, and while you'd be right to worry about (covert, illegal) government surveillance (use encryption, kids) on that line, you would 100% have recourse if you got booted off.

It's not an automatic home run. The First Amendment has exceptions, even beyond "time and manner," and has been substantially eroded by GW Bush and his successors, in the name of fighting terror, animal rights activists and water defenders.

But a lawsuit against your town council for nuking your Turner Diaries fanfic server is a hell of a lot more likely to succeed than griping about Twitter mods failing to grasp the "irony" in your Auschwitz jokes.

The right's war on municipal broadband was its biggest self-own of the 2010s. And while it's not true that "a conservative is a liberal who's been mugged," it might be true that "a municipal broadband activist is a conservative who's been kicked off Twitter."

And this is one of those causes (like shutting down private prisons, or opposing foreign wars of aggression) where a substantial slice of the left and the right can come together (at the most local of levels!) to really Get Shit Done.

Because the other great victims of America's monopolized broadband are people of color, poor people and working class people (often the same people). They live with digital redlining, where they pay 2X for 1/100th the speeds of their affluent neighbors a block away.

They're the ones whose kids are doing homework in Taco Bell parking lots (and getting flunked on their tests because creepy remote proctoring services penalize them for taking their tests in a beat up hatchback and not a private room).

The ones who can't videoconference with dying relatives in ICUs or doctors for telemed consults. Who can't apply for work-at-home jobs, or just play games and watch movies and upload their fun Tiktoks and Youtube videos.

The current system serves about 300 senior execs at telco monopolists, and a few thousand investors, and savagely fucks over everyone else. Even rich people in big cities usually can't buy fiber at any price.

It's time for our four-decade Atlas Shrugged LARP to end. It's time for a bipartisan fiber consensus.

&lt;a name="foia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/81Pt6H-pTnL._AC_SL1466_.jpeg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My letter to the FBI (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/20/damn-the-shrub/#foia"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Last week marked the 20th anniversary of my first blog post; some anonymous axe-grinder gave me a hell of a bloggiversary present: they complained about one of my posts to the FBI, triggering an investigation.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/15/hoover-calling/#g-man"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/15/hoover-calling/#g-man&lt;/a&gt;

Even though my EFF colleague Mark Rumold called the (very professional) special agent, got him to agree that the post (a link to a Popular Mechanics article on the science of toppling monuments) was within my First Amendment rights, I wasn't done.

Today, thanks to the help of the self-described FOIA fiend Aaron Mackey, I sent the FBI a FOIA request for:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any and all records that reflect or otherwise describe any investigations, assessments, or other actions taken by the FBI concerning my July blog post,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any and all records, such as reports, memoranda, or notes relating to, or describing me that reflect or otherwise describe the January 12 communications between the FBI agent, me, and my legal counsel, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any and all records created, collected, or maintained by the FBI that otherwise describe or relate to any FBI investigations, assessments, or other actions concerning me regarding any other protected First Amendment activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's just for openers!

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pursuant to the Privacy Act, I further request that I be allowed to inspect and correct any records maintained about me. 5 U.S.C. §§ 552a(d)(1)-(2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I further request that the FBI—after allowing me to inspect and correct any and all records maintained about me—expunge or otherwise destroy records it collects and maintains that document, reflect, or otherwise describe my exercise of First Amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: let me see what you've got, then delete everything about my protected speech activities. This is a right that every person who is investigated for protected speech is entitled to under the Privacy Act.

Here's the letter I sent; I'm not a lawyer, and you probably aren't either, but it might help you draft your own letter if you get into the same absurd predicament:

&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/images/Doctorow_FOIA_request.pdf"&gt;https://craphound.com/images/Doctorow_FOIA_request.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

You will need to include a U.S. Department of Justice Certification of Identity Form DOJ-361 (don't worry, it's an easy one):

&lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/u-s-department-of-justice-form-361-certification-of-identity.pdf/view"&gt;https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/u-s-department-of-justice-form-361-certification-of-identity.pdf/view&lt;/a&gt;

And you'll need to send it to your local FBI field office, mine is the LA one:

Federal Bureau of Investigation
Los Angeles Field Office
11000 Wilshire Boulevard
Suite 1700
Los Angeles, CA 90024

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/nofly-860x1024.png"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;No one should be on the No-Fly List (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/20/damn-the-shrub/#no-nofly"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

It's been a minute, and the past four years really raised the bar on presidential evil, but here's a thing you should remeber: George W Bush was a fucking terrible president and everything he did was terrible.

The War on Terror - the latest addition to America's pantheon of Forever Wars - leveraged a national trauma to strip away human rights and incinerate official accountability.

Though this was described as a tool for punishing "terrorists," the toolkit it handed to every law enforcement officer, from G-Men to school cops, was given a real workout.

The war on terror turned everyone with a badge into a puny martinet, able to violate the rights of marginalized and disfavored people without fear of any consequences, reversing decades of hard-won progress on civil and human rights.

The punishment the war on terror has meted out to women, LGBTQ+ people, BIPOC people, political progressives, racialized people, Black people, Muslim people, and anyone who looked crosseyed at a mall cop is limitless and endless.

GWB did some really awful shit, like creating offshore torture sites (not just Gitmo, a web of them, around the world), and starting a bogus war that has raged so long that there are adults fighting it today who weren't born when it began.

In the grand scheme of things, the No-Fly List isn't even in the top ten of garbage things for which we should forever curse GWB but it is still an utter piece of shit, an idiotic policy enforced by idiots to no good purpose at the cost of enormous human suffering.

The Identity Project, and its Papers, Please! website, have been documenting the No-Fly List's incoherent cruelty since its inception. Today, they posted an extensive article explaining how the list (really many lists) works.

&lt;a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/01/19/put-them-on-the-no-fly-list/"&gt;https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/01/19/put-them-on-the-no-fly-list/&lt;/a&gt;

There's this thing that happens when you study corruption: you start with this complex, difficult system, and someone who understands it begins to explain it, and as they hold up each piece and say what it does and what it's called, you have a revelation:

Ohhhh, it's just &lt;em&gt;bullshit&lt;/em&gt;.

I mean, go read up on how mortgage-backed securities work, or pharmacy benefits managers, or special purpose acquisition compaies, or cash bail. Really lean into it, pay attention. You'll get there.

The reason it doesn't make sense to lay people isn't that it's complicated. It doesn't make sense because it's fucking &lt;em&gt;nonsense&lt;/em&gt;. The complexity is there to delay this realization.

That's the no-fly list. It's bullshit.

The Qanon-addled white-nationalist cult members who stormed the capitol last week shouldn't be on the no-fly list because there shouldn't be a no-fly list.

And if that's not good enough for you, try this one on: they shouldn't be on the no-fly list because if we lower the already rock-bottom standards for inclusion on that list, they're coming for the people you love next.

G-men and campus cops and TSA gropeaholics and thrice bailed out aviation monopolists and small town cops flush with civil forfeiture cash won't hesitate for an &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt; before putting the Wall of Moms and your whole middle school gay-straight alliance on the list.

Forever.

If there's one thing we should all have learned from the four year nightmare we've just barely survived, it's that being stampeded into taking away rights from people you don't like is an utter monkey's paw, and when the fingers curl, they're coming for you.

We need to do something about the violent, deranged cult that spent the summer showing up in battle-rattle to terrorize state lawmakers, culminating in the Jan 6 riot. We need a COUP Act to investigate the links between cops and Nazis.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/actdottv/status/1351291227530924032"&gt;https://twitter.com/actdottv/status/1351291227530924032&lt;/a&gt;

But what we positively do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need is to expand the power of the institutions that we have good reason to suspect are shot through with unhinged white nationalists so they have even more control over who can exercise the basic human right of going from one place to another.

Always remember: the No-Fly List is composed of people we're sure are too dangerous to be allowed on a plane - but who, inexplicably, we don't have enough evidence against to convict of any crime. In other words, it's an evidence-free witch-ducking stool in the cloud(s).

&lt;h1&gt;Casino mogul steals First Nation's vaccine (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/27/viral-colonialism/#seriously-fuck-that-guy"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Every billionaire is a policy failure. Nearly every millionaire is a policy failure. Every casino industry millionaire, though?

Definitely a policy failure.

Take Rodney Baker, who made $10.6m in 2019 as the CEO of the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, a national racetrack and casino operator. Baker resigned on Sunday, because he did something despicable even by the standards of the casino industry.

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/25/canada-ex-casino-head-fined-covid-vaccine-rodney-baker"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/25/canada-ex-casino-head-fined-covid-vaccine-rodney-baker&lt;/a&gt;

Baker and his wife, the actor Ekaterina Baker, chartered a small plane and flew to Beaver Creek, a tiny First Nations community, where they defrauded their way into getting covid vaccinations intended for elders in the White River First Nation.

&lt;a href="https://www.yukon-news.com/news/former-ceo-of-great-canadian-gaming-actress-charged-after-flying-to-beaver-creek-for-covid-19-vaccine/"&gt;https://www.yukon-news.com/news/former-ceo-of-great-canadian-gaming-actress-charged-after-flying-to-beaver-creek-for-covid-19-vaccine/&lt;/a&gt;

The Bakers did not quarantine on arrival. Rather, they presented themselves at the remote Yukon community - a community whose isolation has offered some protection from the pandemic - as workers at a local motel. In so doing, they recklessly endangered the whole community.

Then they asked for a ride to the airport, which tipped off clinic workers. Officials caught them in Whitehorse and charged them under the Yukon's Civil Emergency Measures Act. They were fined $1150 each.

The White River First Nation has asked Yukon authorities to "pursue a more just punishment" (the Act provides for prison sentences of up to six months for violations); they fear that without meaningful penalties, other wealthy sociopaths will follow the Bakers' example.

I've been thinking about this all day, looking for a bright side. There is none. These millionaires will not go to jail. They won't face social sanction. They'll be invited to private islands and exclusive parties, wooed by charities and flattered by university fundraisers.

They are part of a long Canadian tradition of depraved, inhuman conduct towards First Nations people. The nation's money is slathered in pictures of people who did far worse, after all.

These evil, irredeemable people were just upholding a long Canadian tradition.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;a name="ico-schtum"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/icosilence.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Facebook champions (its own) privacy (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/27/viral-colonialism/#ico-schtum"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

According to their Twitter bio, the mission of the UK's Information Commissioner's Office is to "uphold[] information rights in the public interest, promotes openness by public bodies &amp;amp; data privacy for individuals."

Great values, but actions speak louder than words. ICO chief Elizabeth Denham has told Parliament that she can't divulge the status of her office's audit of Facebook's app, which was triggered by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/facebooks-secret-settlement-on-cambridge-analytica-gags-uk-data-watchdog/"&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/facebooks-secret-settlement-on-cambridge-analytica-gags-uk-data-watchdog/&lt;/a&gt;

She told Welsh Labour MP Kevin Brennan that she couldn't discuss the audit in public because her office had entered into a confidentiality agreement with Facebook whose terms couldn't be known by the public.

The ICO settled with FB after the toxic social media giant got a tribunal to agree to consider "allegations of bias" within the regulator against the company (in other words, FB whinged that the referee didn't like it and the tribunal bought it).

FBI got off with a slap on the wrist: a £500k fine, no admission of wrongdoing, and, it seems, a gag order for a regulator whose mission features "openness."

The settlement was reached in 2018, but this is news today because FB and the ICO hid the gag order's existence until the issue came up in Parliament.

Commissioner Denham also disclosed that FB got to keep the ICO's internal files - interviews with whistleblowers and files seized from Cambridge Analytica - indefinitely, to help the company's own internal investigation into Cambridge Analytica.

While the ICO and Zuckerberg did not mention the gag order or the document handover in 2018, they did trumpet an "app audit" that was meant to root out other "sketchy apps" engaged in abuse similar to Cambridge Analytica's.

This audit has never reported in. Facebook won't tell us what became of it, and the ICO can't.

&lt;h1&gt;Goldman CEO gets $17.5m reward for $4.5b fraud (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/27/viral-colonialism/#failing-up"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In 1997, Fair Wayne Bryan was convicted of stealing a pair of hedge-clippers. He was given a life-sentence because of other minor thefts. He was paroled from Angola prison in late 2020.

&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-man-serving-life-sentence-stealing-hedge-clippers-granted-parole-n1243757"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-man-serving-life-sentence-stealing-hedge-clippers-granted-parole-n1243757&lt;/a&gt;

In 2015, a conspiracy involving the Malaysian "tabloid party boy" Jho Low and a clutch of Goldman Sachs bankers stole and laundered $4.5b from the country's 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund (1MDB).

&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/former-goldman-sachs-bankers-charged-multibillion-dollar-money-laundering-scandal-n929916"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/former-goldman-sachs-bankers-charged-multibillion-dollar-money-laundering-scandal-n929916&lt;/a&gt;

The multibillion dollar crime toppled the Malaysian government, but Goldman Sachs maintained that this was the result of a couple of rogue elements, despite evidence that the rot went all the way to the top.

&lt;a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2018/12/18/goldman-sachs-fires-back-after-malaysia-charges-bank-in-1mdb-probe/"&gt;https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2018/12/18/goldman-sachs-fires-back-after-malaysia-charges-bank-in-1mdb-probe/&lt;/a&gt;

Goldman Sachs is a repeat offender. It played a key role in the mass financial fraud that triggered 2008's Great Financial Crisis, then used bailout money to pay giant bonuses to the top execs that presided over the fraud.

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs_controversies"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs_controversies&lt;/a&gt;

The company has a long history of manipulating stock prices with bribes and kickbacks. Its frauds led to the collapse of the Greek economy. It underwrote California state bonds, advised its clients to short those same bonds, and made a fortune.

Goldman's CEO since 2018 has been David Solomon. His base compensation (which only accounts for a fraction of his total take-home) is $27.5m.

This week, the board cut Solomon's base pay to $17.5m.

&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/business/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-pay-cut/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/business/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-pay-cut/index.html&lt;/a&gt;

The cut was triggered by a $3b fine over 1MDB. Solomon's "leadership" was part of a string of multibillion-dollar thefts and frauds that cost his employe $3b and his punishment is a $17.5m payday.

Fair Wayne Bryan served 23 years in a federal pen for stealing a pair of hedge clippers. He is still a convicted felon, on parole for his life sentence.

Goldman Sachs is still in business and its C-suite have been punished with multimillion-dollar payouts.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/81Pt6H-pTnL._AC_SL1466_.jpeg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The FBI has never heard of me (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/07/a-long-surrender/#feeble-excuses"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Back in January, I got a very odd call from an FBI Special Agent, who wanted to discuss a blog post I'd written summarizing a Popular Mechanics article on the physics of monument toppling, having received a complaint about it.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/15/hoover-calling/#g-man"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/15/hoover-calling/#g-man&lt;/a&gt;

Thankfully, I have access to some of the very best civil liberties lawyers in the nation, namely my colleagues at EFF. Andrew Mackey, an EFF lawyer who specializes in this kind of thing, had a talk with the agent, who agreed that I'd broken no laws and dropped the matter.

Aaron did one better. He helped me draft a Freedom of Information Act request to the FBI along with a demand that my record there be expunged, as is my right under settled precedent.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/20/damn-the-shrub/#foia"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/20/damn-the-shrub/#foia&lt;/a&gt;

To their credit, the FBI responded very quickly to this written request! Within days, I had a letter back from them.

To their shame, the FBI responded by saying they had NO records at all of this incident, so there was nothing further I could do.

Now, this is obviously a lie. FBI agents make records of complaints, of their assessment of complaints, of the calls they make to follow up on the complaint, and of their assessment of those calls, It is inconceivable that this incident generated no records.

But this is par for the course for the Bureau, which routinely flouts transparency law with these kinds of responses. Now, Aaron helped me prepare an appeals letter, which points all of this out and strongly reminds them that responding to requests like mine isn't optional.

As with my initial FOIA letter, I'm posting this appeal so that others can refer to it when making their own appeals in similar situations. I'm not a lawyer and this isn't legal advice, but it's a good place to start.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/61nQmCoB4OL.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Compared to climate denial, Qanon is benign (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/07/a-long-surrender/#paranoid-style"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

"Serious" figures on the right say that presence of an open Qanon conspiracist in the GOP Congressional caucus represents a crossroads for Republicans: does the party support reality-based policies, or will it surrender to unhinged conspiracies?

&lt;a href="https://reason.com/2021/02/03/marjorie-taylor-greene-presents-republicans-with-a-sadly-familiar-choice-between-blind-loyalty-to-trump-and-a-basic-respect-for-reality/"&gt;https://reason.com/2021/02/03/marjorie-taylor-greene-presents-republicans-with-a-sadly-familiar-choice-between-blind-loyalty-to-trump-and-a-basic-respect-for-reality/&lt;/a&gt;

Says John Quiggin: the right surrendered a generation ago, when it embraced climate change denial: "all the governments in the world, backed up by every major scientific institution, were advancing a fraudulent theory of global warming."

&lt;a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2021/02/07/climate-conspiracy-classical-liberalism-and-q-anon/"&gt;https://crookedtimber.org/2021/02/07/climate-conspiracy-classical-liberalism-and-q-anon/&lt;/a&gt;

This position wasn't merely something party bosses threw at low-information voters, either: the intellectual, libertarian wing of the party, like Cato's Pat Michaels, advanced an explicit, conspiratorial account of the climate emergency.

&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/dr-patrick-michaels-on-the-truth-about-global-warming"&gt;https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/dr-patrick-michaels-on-the-truth-about-global-warming&lt;/a&gt;

" … it’s not the science determining how much it’s going to warm. A lot of people don’t know this, but it happens to be true, and you know, we could speculate as to why that paper was published right before the 2016 election? I wouldn’t want to impute causation, but gee …"

"So now, the academy roots for anything that is big government that it feels it can tie onto to maintain this relationship. The roots of political correctness, there are many, manifold and varied. But one of them certainly was the enslavement of the academy."

As Quiggin points out, climate denial is far more consequential, unhinged and reality-denying that Qanon. Qanon, stop the steal, etc at least posit that there's a conspiracy in service to a massive, ambitious goal, stealing a nation or a planet.

"By contrast, Michaels wants an equally expansive conspiracy with tens of thousand of particpants (including lots of rightwing governments), whose object is – the establishment of an emissions trading scheme?"

&lt;h1&gt;Dependency Confusion (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/11/rhodium-at-2900-per-oz/#extra-index-url"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In "Dependency Confusion," security researcher Alex Birsan describes how he made a fortune in bug bounties by exploiting a new supply-chain attack he calls "dependency confusion," which allowed him to compromise "Apple, Microsoft and dozens of others."

&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610"&gt;https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610&lt;/a&gt;

Dependency Confusion is incredibly, delightfully clever. It is grounded in the fact that software developers rely on "dependencies" (prebuilt, modular code libraries) when they build new versions of their software.

The javascript files used to build new versions are often public, and by looking inside them, you can find out the names of the libraries used to build popular applications, from Uber to Yelp to Netflix.

Now, these libraries are a mix of widely used public libraries and private, in-house ones, and when the software is being built, the system checks both the canonical public archives of code libraries and private company servers.

Birsan's insight was that if he created new, malicious libraries with the same names as the private ones, and put them on the public servers, then the build system might preferentially snag and incorporate his malicious code instead of the private ones.

Some build systems have a weak security measure: if a library is found in more than one repository, the system defaults to the one with the higher version-number, so Birsan gave his libraries version numbers like "9000.0.0."

Birsan was able to attack Python, Ruby and Microsoft .NET-based apps. His reports resulted in fixes to many of the apps involved, but some of the infrastructure tools, like Jfrog Artifactory, still default to an insecure mode, and class his bug report as a "feature request."

And Birsan thinks there's plenty more bug bounties out there waiting to be claimed for attacks like this: "finding new and clever ways to leak internal package names will expose even more vulnerable systems, and looking into alternate programming languages and repositories to target will reveal some additional attack surface for dependency confusion bugs"

&lt;h1&gt;Adam Curtis on criti-hype (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/11/rhodium-at-2900-per-oz/#hypernormal"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Adam Curtis is a brilliant documentarian, and films like Hypernormalization and series like All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace had a profound effect on my thinking about politics, technology and human thriving.

In this interview with The Idler's Tom Hodgkinson, Curtis lays out a compact, incisive and important critique of the big social media platforms - and of their critics, who give these companies far too much credit.

&lt;a href="https://www.idler.co.uk/article/adam-curtis-social-media-is-a-scam/"&gt;https://www.idler.co.uk/article/adam-curtis-social-media-is-a-scam/&lt;/a&gt;

Curtis puts Big Tech's self-serving boasts about how good it is at manipulating public opinion in the same bucket as other outlandish claims of secret, astounding accomplishments, such as those made by British spy agencies.

When the Snowden leaks came to light, Curtis published an absolutely brilliant, jaw-dropping article on the BBC about his own investigations into spy agencies,

&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/3662a707-0af9-3149-963f-47bea720b460"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/3662a707-0af9-3149-963f-47bea720b460&lt;/a&gt;

He concluded that spy agencies are filled with unhinged, unreliable sociopaths whose claims of competence only survive because everything they do is secret, so we have to take their word for it.

Once you understand this, you have to rethink the problem with intelligence agencies - not that they use surveillance effectively, but rather that they use it indiscriminately, to justify all kinds of dirty tricks against the targets of their paranoid prejudice.

The mainstream critique of spy agencies - the one that accepts their claims to hypercompetence at face value - is doing the spy agencies a favor, affirming these baseless claims. It's a species of what Lee Vinsel calls "criti-hype":

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/02/euthanize-rentiers/#dont-believe-the-hype"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/02/euthanize-rentiers/#dont-believe-the-hype&lt;/a&gt;

Curtis agrees with Vinsel: the critique of social media centered on the industry's claims of devastating efficacy gives the industry far too much credit. He points out that advertisers are coming to the conclusion that ad-tech is a swindle, a bezzle:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/04/how-to-truth/#adfraud"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/04/how-to-truth/#adfraud&lt;/a&gt;

If tech doesn't make money by being good at advertising, how to account for its riches? Curtis says it's monopoly: "four giant corporations who don’t produce anything, contribute nothing to the wealth of the country, hoard their billions of dollars in order to pounce on anything that appears to be a competitor and buy it out immediately."

Curtis says that dark, irrational political movements aren't the result of Big Tech's algorithmic radicalization, but rather the material conditions created by a corrupt system:

"For 20 years, they’ve been offered no choice between the political parties. They’ve been given this enormous button that says 'Fuck off' and they’ve pressed it. That’s a rational thing to do."

This nihilistic conduct is the inevitable product of the "high individualism" doctrine: "in a period of high individualism, the one thing you don’t notice is power. You’re supposed to be an empowered individual yourself."

Think of how climate change debates have been dominated by "personal responsibility" as though the emergency stems from your personal recycling habits or your choice not to use underfunded transit.

When we're offered solutions, they turn on criti-hyped fields like "AI," which is actually just machine learning, which, in turn, is just statistical inference, with no path to producing anything like intelligence:

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/&lt;/a&gt;

Curtis talks about how corruption has made us suspicious of science, and that vacuum gets filled with a kind of individualistic religion - citing Ayn Rand's claim not to fear death "because I won’t die, the world will die."

Curtis says the path forward is to "square the circle" between individualism and collective action - to find ways that individuals can become part of a collective, a movement, grounded in science that is liberated from industrial corruption.

"The internet is the thing that could do it, except the bastards got hold of it and isolated us even more. We are being made to do this work for free for them and they feed us stuff and we remain in our little bubbles...I would argue for the nationalisation of the internet."

I'm not sure about nationalization (though a publicly owned part of the internet is an intriguing idea), but so much of this resonated with me, and got a the points I tried to make with my 2020 book HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM.

&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Catalytic converter theft (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/11/rhodium-at-2900-per-oz/#ccscrap"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Back in the early 2010s, people started falling into open sewer entrances in New York City and other large metros - because a China-driven spike in the price of scrap metal, combined with post-2008 unemployment, gave rise to an army of metal-thieves.

&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSBRE84210I20120503"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSBRE84210I20120503&lt;/a&gt;

A decade later, there's a new precarity- and bubble-fuelled metal-theft epidemic: stealing catalytic converters out of parked cars to harvest their palladium and rhodium for re-use in the global auto-sector, which is facing strict emissions controls.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/climate/catalytic-converter-theft.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/climate/catalytic-converter-theft.html&lt;/a&gt;

Palladium and rhodium prices are soaring: palladium is up from $500/oz in 2016 to $2000-$2500/oz; rhodium rose from $640/oz to $21,900/oz (!). This puts a serious dent in auto profits - in 2019, the industry spent an extra $18b on metals (it was higher in 2020).

2021 will see the auto industry buying $40b worth of catalytic converter metals, and this has driven a secondary market where scrappers are using targeted ads exhorting people to bring in old converters for recycling.

Catalytic converters are pretty easy to harvest from cars: it just takes a few minutes' work under the car to detach a compact, fungible source of wealth, and even if your state has rules requiring ID to make the sale, chances are the next state over doesn't.

In the New York Times, Hiroko Tabuchi talks to people at the center of the phenomenon, like the tow-yard operator who deflates the tires of cars "so they can’t slither underneath" and who has had to repeatedly tow the same vehicle after it had it converter stolen and re-stolen.

Converters can be sold to scrappers by mail, and you can learn how to boost one in any of several Youtube videos. Cops suggest engraving your VIN into your converter, and people are homebrewing CC armor.

&lt;a name="manorial-apple"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/digmanor.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Apple puts North Dakota on blast (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/11/rhodium-at-2900-per-oz/#manorial-apple"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Republican North Dakota legislators have introduced SB2333, a bill that prohibits large tech companies from locking their users into a single app store or payment processor.

&lt;a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/documents/21-1044-01000.pdf"&gt;https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/documents/21-1044-01000.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

While his has implications for Android and other large tech platforms, its most immediate and far-reaching effects with be on Apple, whose Ios platform uses lock-in to monopolize both apps and payments (and another domain, not mentioned in the bill: repairs).

Predictably, this has thrown Apple into a fury, with Apple's privacy chief Erik Neuenschwander telling the SD legislature that Apple uses its monopoly over the app store to protect its users' privacy and security.

&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/apple-privacy-chief-slams-north-dakota-bill/"&gt;https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/apple-privacy-chief-slams-north-dakota-bill/&lt;/a&gt;

Neuenschwander makes a good, but incomplete, point. To the extent that Apple has the same interests as its users, it uses its app store monopoly to lock out bad apps (to the best of its ability).

But when Apple's interests diverge from its users' interests, the prohibition on sideloading apps actively harms those users' privacy and security. Think of how Apple caved to Chinese state demands to remove working VPNs from the Ios app store to facilitate mass surveillance.

This security model - surrendering your autonomy to a large company in exchange for promises of protection - is what Bruce Schneier calls "feudal security," though it should really be thought of as "manorial security."

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/01/cory-doctorow-neofeudalism-and-the-digital-manor/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2021/01/cory-doctorow-neofeudalism-and-the-digital-manor/&lt;/a&gt;

In manorial security, a small elite of mercantalist warlords get all the property rights - the right to decide how the infrastructure is used - and the rest of us get tenants' rights, the right to make limited use of the warlords' property.

The warlords promise to defend us from bandits and build high walls to keep the bandits out, but if someone suborns the warlord to acting against us, those walls lock us &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;, leaving us helpless.

Indeed, the walls aren't just a protection, they're a temptation: anyone who coerces or bribes a warlord into letting them inside the compound enjoys a smorgasbord of defenseless prey - the walled garden becomes a feedlot.

Which is why Neuenschwander is more wrong than right: Apple keeps out the bad apps it finds, except when a powerful state makes it an offer it can't refuse.

The fact that users are held prisoner to those judgments is an invitation to states to make demands of Apple.

Which suggests a corollary: if Apple's users &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sideload apps that subverted harmful government orders, then those orders would be less effective - and governments would be less tempted to make them in the first place, and if they did anyway, users would have an out.

I don't know enough about North Dakota state politics to weigh the bill's chances, but if it passes, it creates some fascinating possibilities. ND is one of America's fiber optic powerhouses, with much higher gigabit penetration than other states.

If moving your company to ND means that you get to retain 30% more of your income - because you're no longer paying the app store tax - &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you get to save money on real-estate &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; all your employees get fiber, well, that's pretty attractive.

To get a sense of what this could mean, check out the testimony of Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson in support of the bill, describing how Apple shook down his company for 30% of the revenues for Hey, its innovative email reader.

&lt;a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/testimony-before-the-north-dakota-senate-industry-business-and-labor-committee/"&gt;https://m.signalvnoise.com/testimony-before-the-north-dakota-senate-industry-business-and-labor-committee/&lt;/a&gt;

"North Dakota has the opportunity to create this level playing field, such that the next generation of software companies can be started there, and if a team in Bismarck builds a better digital mouse trap, they won’t be hampered by abusive, extortive demands for 30% of their revenue from the existing big tech giants."

As Heinemeier Hansson points out, the bill is very short - 17 lines, plus some recitals - and it's well-crafted...for the most part. One thing jumps out though:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This section does not apply to a proprietor of a special-purpose digital application distribution platform.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What's a "special-purpose digital application distribution platform?"

It's "a gaming console, music player, and other special-purpose devices connected to the internet."

That is a seriously weird carve-out. Consoles &lt;em&gt;invented&lt;/em&gt; the app store business model, and they use it aggressively today to screw games studios and gamers. Exempting them from this is like exempting printers from a ban on high-priced consumables.

And all those other "special purpose" devices - smart speakers, medical implants, home automation systems, etc - are just as prone to being monopolized and produce just as many harms for their users through anticompetitive app store conduct as phones do.

They're overwhelmingly made by the same companies that operate abusive app stores for phones, which means that if this carve out was created by lobbyists, it's weird that they didn't lobby for a carve out for phones, too.

&lt;h1&gt;My talks with Edward Snowden and William Gibson (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/19/texas-lysenko/#gibson-snowden"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Earlier this month, I hosted two extraordinary book-launch events: one for the paperback edition of William Gibson's novel AGENCY, the other for the young readers' edition of Ed Snowden's memoir, PERMANENT RECORD.

Both events were incredibly exciting. Gibson spoke at length about the relationship of politics to the way he creates futuristic parables (Agency was delayed for a rewrite after the 2016 election) and Snowden, about the way that young people relate to surveillance tech.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/9781250767929.jpg"/&gt;

Now, both are online, courtesy of the booksellers that hosted them. Copperfields Books posted the Snowden video yesterday:

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dipfjn3bir8"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dipfjn3bir8&lt;/a&gt;

And here's my review of the Young Readers' Edition of Permanent Record:

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/71WqLOpjn4L-1.jpg"/&gt;

Not to be outdone, yesterday also marked The Strand's release of the Gibson video:

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijGkwzrE1MY"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijGkwzrE1MY&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a name="capitol-riots"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/magacappolice.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Complicity, incompetence, leadership and Capitol Police (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/19/texas-lysenko/#capitol-riots"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In the aftermath of the Jan 6 Trumpist putsch at the Capitol, the world reeled - not just at the spectacle of the Capitol building overrun by deranged armed insurrectionists, but also at the manifest incompetence of the Capitol Police.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/07/revolutionary-colossus/#selective-incompetence"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/07/revolutionary-colossus/#selective-incompetence&lt;/a&gt;

The Capitol Police command $460m/year, 10% of Congress's total budget. They had ample warning that murderous, anti-democratic revolutionaries were converging on the Capitol. They had a long track-record of over-responding to protests with overwhelming shows of force.

Given the track-record, the budget and the warnings, could we truly attribute the failure to contain the insurrectionists to incompetence? Did the shots of police officers taking selfies with members of a lynch mob mean that the force was complicit with the traitors?

Now, six officers have been suspended and 29 more are under investigation for collaborating with the rioters. They join the nationwide active-duty military and police officers who have faced consequences for their role in the mob violence.

&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/18/politics/capitol-police-officers-suspended/"&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/18/politics/capitol-police-officers-suspended/&lt;/a&gt;

Last week, Propublica published a chilling, brilliant investigation by Joaquin Sapien and Joshua Kaplan sourced from 19 current and former Capitol Police officers who are furious and bewildered at the failure of their command.

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/i-dont-trust-the-people-above-me-riot-squad-cops-open-up-about-disastrous-response-to-capitol-insurrection"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/i-dont-trust-the-people-above-me-riot-squad-cops-open-up-about-disastrous-response-to-capitol-insurrection&lt;/a&gt;

They describe scenes of absolute carnage and chaos, of rioters who were so aggressive and violent that officers suspected that they were high on meth, of protesters fumbling their own firearms and trying to grab pistols off officers' hips.

They describe leaders who were given actionable intelligence about the coup attempt, but directed their focus to paranoid fantasies about antifa counter-demonstrators, and who broke with the procedures used against BLM protests, standing down officers who could have helped.

They describe officers who were told to leave behind weapons and armor, who then feared for their lives as they were overrun, who were denied access to riot helmets and sustained serious head-injuries.

The anemic response by Capitol Police to surges and incursions almost didn't happen at all, it seems: officers who joined the lines and fought the rioters did so in defiance of their orders to sit pat - orders that were not rescinded because their commanders were MIA.

The officers' account reveals an organization always up for beating paralyzed wheelchair users seeking better health care, or to gas and brutalize Black Lives Matter protesters, but were unprepared (and whose leaders were unwilling) to respond to right-wing terror groups.

The last word in the Propublica report goes to officers who describe the collapse of their confidence in their leadership: "I don’t trust the people above me to make decisions to bring me home safe."

"Many are looking for new jobs."

&lt;a name="mess-with-texas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/texasfreeze.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How Republicans froze Texas solid (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/19/texas-lysenko/#mess-with-texas"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The collapse of Texas's power grid during a lethal cold snap has put Texas politics under a spotlight. There's no better place to start than the Deconstructed podcast, where Ryan Grim delivers a historically informed, timely series of interviews.

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/19/deconstructed-texas-republicans-experiment/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2021/02/19/deconstructed-texas-republicans-experiment/&lt;/a&gt;

Grim reminds us that the roots of Texas's woes are in the 2002 midterms, when the GOP took the Texas House for the first time in a generation, then engaged in brutal gerrymandering to keep it, and embarked on a string of ideology-driven deregulation adventures.

The GOP ideology holds that businesses are "efficient" because every penny they squeeze out of their costs is converted to profit. There's a kernel of truth to this - indeed, the most prominent early theorist of this was Karl Marx!

In an unregulated market, capitalists increase profits by reducing labor and input costs, and/or by raising prices. Competition is supposed to prevent prices from going up, so when market proponents talk about "efficiency" they really mean reducing labor and input costs.

Markets do squeeze input costs. The "dematerialization" of goods and buildings has been a steady march for more than a century - from the steel in your car to the concrete in your home to the energy consumed by your TV, the world uses less stuff and energy to make more.

But material and energy efficiencies require innovation. Reducing labor costs, on the other hand, merely requires &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;. Capitalists whose workers are denied collective bargaining and a social safety net can squeeze wages far more easily than energy or materials.

And of course, not all material and energy savings are created equal. It's one thing for Ikea to figure out how to shave material inputs from composite shelves by inventing better glue - it's another for a company to reduce material costs by dumping toxic waste.

Again, the difference is between innovation and power. Making stronger, cheaper, more efficient materials requires investment in R&amp;amp;D. Saving by externalizing your costs - by imposing harms on others - merely requires the power to get away with it.

The GOP experiment involves granting unlimited power to corporations, through "deregulation" - stripping worker protections, environmental protections, and operating standards. And, as our right wing friends like to remind us, "incentives matter."

Relieved of the need to negotiate with workers, compensate the public for harms, or provide high-quality services, "the market" responds by slashing wages, harming the public, and tightening the slack in the system that allows it to cope gracefully with abnormal conditions.

Hence "we are experiencing unexpected call volumes, please hold." That's "efficiency" - squeezing down staff levels to levels that barely cope with median load, so any bobble results in long lines. Hence aviation breakdowns when a single hub airport (like DFW) is snowed in.

Hence a power-grid that is fully isolated from neighboring states. Hence generation facilities that were not weatherized despite multiple historical events that proved they'd be needed, someday, one as recent as 2011.

There are windmills in northern Canada. In Norway. At the &lt;em&gt;Antarctic research stations&lt;/em&gt;. If Texas's windmills shut down during the storm, it's not because we don't know how to make cold-weather windmills - it's because allowing windmills to fail in cold weather was profitable.

Lysenkoism was the Soviet Union's disastrous foray into politicized science. For ideological reasons, Stalin bought into the beliefs of Lysenko, who said that the traits a parent acquired in their life could be genetically passed onto their children.

Stalin insisted on applying Lysenkoism to wheat cultivation, to prove that his ideology would work. The result was the famine of 1932-3, which killed tens of millions of people. So many people that there weren't enough survivors to count the dead.

The Republican insistence that selfishness is optimal, that companies should only care about maximizing shareholder returns, that deregulation produces efficiencies, that states cannot perform - this is American Lysenkoism.

American Lysenkoism is why Red States like Texas refused to lock down and have told each county to design its own vaccination and public health program. It's also why those states refuse climate science.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/03/give-me-slack/#reality-is-a-leftist"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/03/give-me-slack/#reality-is-a-leftist&lt;/a&gt;

American Lysenkoism kills. It's why the pandemic has killed 500k Americans. It's why so many Texans are in danger of freezing to death now. It's also why Republicans - the "party of life" - are performatively refusing to care about these deaths.

You can't be an American Lysenkoist unless you deny that we have a shared destiny. That's why climate, pandemic, energy, education and health are so confounding to conservatives. These are systems that require collective responses.

Energy is a collective enterprise (Lenin: "Communism is soviet power plus electrification of the whole country"). It requires failover to nearby grids. It requires "overinvestment" in peak capacity. It requires cooperation and coordination to smooth out discontinuities.

Maybe a market could accomplish this, but so far it hasn't. Instead, deregulated power systems strip out safety margins, undermaintain facilities, underinvest in improvements, and price-gouge.

As James K Galbraith writes for the Institute for New Economic Thinking: "Demand for electricity is what economists call inelastic: it doesn’t respond much to price, but it does respond to changes in the weather, and at such times, of heat or cold, the demand becomes even more inelastic."

And "Supply has to exactly equal demand every single minute of every single day. If it doesn’t, the entire system can fail."

Only a Lysenkoist could see these truths and still opt for deregulating energy.

&lt;a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/cold-truth-the-texas-freeze-is-a-catastrophe-of-the-free-market"&gt;https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/cold-truth-the-texas-freeze-is-a-catastrophe-of-the-free-market&lt;/a&gt;

Now Texas is in the grips of a double-whammy. The covid-overloaded hospitals are treating exposure and CO-poisoning cases. Potentially infectious families are doubling up in the few heated homes.

As Kelsey McKinney writes for Defector, Texas epitomizes America's failed love-affair with Lysenkoism, battered by climate (hurricanes, floods, freezes), pandemic without public health, and a dematerialized energy grid, destined to fail.

&lt;a href="https://defector.com/texas-energy-crisis-lying/"&gt;https://defector.com/texas-energy-crisis-lying/&lt;/a&gt;

Lysenkoism demands a hard heart. To survive watching your neighbors die for your ideology, you must somehow shift the blame to them. Small wonder that Ted Cruz feels empowered to take his germ-ridden family to a Cancun resort, abandoning his constituents.

Tim Boyd, the Texas mayor who had to resign after telling his residents that their city owed them nothing, that the strong would survive and the weak would perish? He was just being a good Lysenkoist.

&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-boyd-texas-mayor-colorado-city-resigns-power-outages/"&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-boyd-texas-mayor-colorado-city-resigns-power-outages/&lt;/a&gt;

You can't embrace an ideology that kills your neighbors and still look yourself in the mirror unless you can find a way to make it all your neighbors' fault. Lysenko is a monstrous ideology, and it makes monsters of its adherents.

&lt;h1&gt;Uber loses court battle, steals wages, censors whistleblower (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/19/texas-lysenko/#unter"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Uber is a money-hemmorhaging bezzle ("the magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it"). Its $6.8b losses in 2020 are not an aberration.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/16/ring-ring-lapd-calling/#uber-unter"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/16/ring-ring-lapd-calling/#uber-unter&lt;/a&gt;

Uber will never be profitable.

Like all scams, Uber depends on fresh suckers coming in and buying out the last round of suckers. To do this, the company has to keep running, even as it loses money.

In fact, the longer Uber stays in business while losing money, the more suckers flock to it. The thinking goes, "All these investors who piled into a money-losing company must know something I don't about how it will become profitable someday."

This is also known as the "a pile of shit this big must have a pony under it somewhere."

Key to the pile-of-shit illusion is the ongoing ability to misclassify its workers as independent contractors and so deny them a living wage and minimum benefits.

That's why Uber heavily underwrote the $200b cash-flood that resulted in the passage of California's Prop 22, which legalizes worker misclassification, and why it's agitating for comparable rules in the EU:

&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html"&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html&lt;/a&gt;

But the thing is, Uber drivers are obviously employees. Uber decides how much they'll be paid. It doesn't let them choose which passengers they'll pick up. It closely monitors, disciplines and fires drivers at will. Uber is a driver's boss, not their client.

The UK Supreme Court just agreed, ruling in favor of two drivers. The ruling entitles Uber drivers to normal workplace protections and wages. Of course, Uber says it only applies to a handful of workers and says it won't comply with the ruling.

&lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2268594-uber-drivers-are-workers-rules-uk-supreme-court-what-happens-next/"&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2268594-uber-drivers-are-workers-rules-uk-supreme-court-what-happens-next/&lt;/a&gt;

But even if Uber is forced to end the charade of worker misclassification, it has other ways to slow down the rate at which it bleeds money until the current suckers can unload their stock on bigger suckers. Chief among these is wage-theft.

Long before Amazon started stealing its drivers' tips, Uber was raking 40% of the "tips" that passengers registered through their apps.

&lt;a href="https://blogs.findlaw.com/decided/2017/02/uber-settles-class-action-claim-of-stealing-driver-tips.html"&gt;https://blogs.findlaw.com/decided/2017/02/uber-settles-class-action-claim-of-stealing-driver-tips.html&lt;/a&gt;

Uber formally ended its tip-theft, and then invented other ways to steal from drivers. Primary among these is miscalculating mileage for fares: though the process is opaque and shrouded in mystery, it appears that they are using straight-line, crow-flies measurements.

That resulting in drivers getting paid for a 6-minute drive that takes 50 minutes. That's why Armin Samii, an Ubereats deliverator, created Ubercheats, an app that helped drivers detect and document wage-theft.

Uber used a false trademark claim to get Ubercheats blocked from the Chrome store (trademark claims are valid when they involve "confusion" about the "origin of goods and services" - not "nominative uses" that use a product's marks descriptively).

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArminSamii/status/1361717557431054340"&gt;https://twitter.com/ArminSamii/status/1361717557431054340&lt;/a&gt;

Samii told Motherboard that he wouldn't rename his app. He's in the right, and he won't back down. Good for him.

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8yvm/uber-shuts-down-app-that-lets-users-know-how-badly-theyve-been-cheated"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8yvm/uber-shuts-down-app-that-lets-users-know-how-badly-theyve-been-cheated&lt;/a&gt;

The free culture/free software movement has waged a decades-long, unsuccessful war on the term "IP" on the grounds that it is deceptive and incoherent - trademark, copyright, patent and other regulations have unrelated goals and mechanisms, and they're not "property".

But I think that was misguided. "IP" has a crisp meaning when used by industry: it means, "Any rule or regulation that allows me to control the conduct of my critics, customers or competitors."

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/&lt;/a&gt;

Uber's trademark claim was pure IP. There's no chance someone will mistake Samii's app for a ride-hailing tool. But by (ab)using trademark law, Uber got to shut down a critic who documented its illegal conduct. Is it any wonder the corporate world fights so hard for "IP"?

&lt;h1&gt;Tech trustbusting's moment has arrived (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/20/escape-velocity/#trustbusting-time"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When it's railroading time, you get railroads.

When the railroads turn into the personal satrapies of rail-barons, you get trustbusters.

A couple decades ago, it was online service time. We had the users, the telcoms systems, the computers, the modems, so we got platforms.

We had that, but we lacked something important: effective antimonopoly enforcement. Lax merger laws allowed companies with access to capital markets to buy out or neutralize all their competitors, so we got monopolies.

Right on schedule, we're getting digital trustbusters.

Now, some people aren't technically sophisticated, but they do understand a lot about competition law. That's how you get meat-and-taters antitrust proposals like Amy Klobuchar's CALERA, which address the structural problems with antitrust law.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/06/calera/#fuck-bork"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/06/calera/#fuck-bork&lt;/a&gt;

Klobuchar's bill is hugely important. The reason we have monopolies is that we stopped enforcing anti-monopoly law 40 years ago. Monopoly isn't a tech problem, it's everywhere from sneakers to glass bottles to pro wrestling to candy to aerospace.

&lt;a href="https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers"&gt;https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers&lt;/a&gt;

Klobuchar's CALERA doesn't just seek to apply antitrust law to tech - it also explicitly restores the pre-Reagan basis for fighting monopolies: we fight monopolies because they concentrate power and corrupt our politics. All monopolies are guilty unless proven otherwise.

But though industries all attained their monopolies through similar tactics - predatory acquisitions and mergers, vertical integration - they also each have their own technical characteristics that must inform our demonopolization tactics.

Take emergency care: monopolists love ERs because we don't choose which ER to use, nor when. You can't shop for an ER from the back of an ambulance. You don't know going in whether you're going to spend $1m or $1k. And you'll buy whatever services the ER tells you to buy.

Or power-grids: demand for electricity is both inelastic (you need power when you need power) and price-insensitive, and that inelasticity &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; with demand: that is, when it's freezing or boiling out, everyone wants electricity.

Tech, of course, has its own technical characteristics. Chief among these is its flexibility. At a deep, theoretical level our digital tools and networks are capable of interoperating with one another in ways that no physical technologies can match.

Think of the Australian rail-system. In the mid-19th century, would-be rail-barons laid differing gauges in hopes of conquering the nation's logistics and transport. For 150+ years, engineers have tried to solve the "multi-gauge muddle" by designing multi-system railcars.

Hundreds of designs for cars that retract and extrude different wheelbases have been tried, and none ever caught on. Instead, Australia is tearing up and re-laying thousands of kilometers' worth of track. With physical tech, "compatibility" often means starting from scratch.

Not so with digital tech. If you are an OS company whose rival has locked up all office docs in a proprietary format, you don't have to convince all its customers to abandon their documents and start over. You just make a compatible program:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay&lt;/a&gt;

With digital and physical tech, network effects drive high switching costs, but when it comes to digital, network effects are a double-edged sword.

With interoperability, a walled garden can easily become a feed-lot, where customers for a new service are neatly arrayed for competitors to come and harvest.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/01/twitter-and-interoperability-some-thoughts-peanut-gallery"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/01/twitter-and-interoperability-some-thoughts-peanut-gallery&lt;/a&gt;

Good tech policy emphasizes interoperability when it comes to demonopolizing the digital world. Long before the US ACCESS Act and the EU Digital Markets Act, Mike Masnick published his seminal "Protocols, Not Platforms" paper.

&lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech"&gt;https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech&lt;/a&gt;

And Daphne Keller's work on "Magic APIs" presaged the ACCESS Act's idea of forcing tech companies to expose the APIs they use internally so that competitors can plug into their services:

&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200901/13524045226/if-lawmakers-dont-like-platforms-speech-rules-heres-what-they-can-do-about-it-spoiler-options-arent-great.shtml"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200901/13524045226/if-lawmakers-dont-like-platforms-speech-rules-heres-what-they-can-do-about-it-spoiler-options-arent-great.shtml&lt;/a&gt;

(that paper is outstanding, BTW, with clear-eyed assessments of alternatives, like a digital fairness doctrine, "common carriage" rules, an "indecency" standard for content moderation - basically a checklist for "So you've got a plan to fix tech - did you think of ____?")

Masnick's "protocols" are a vision for a decentralized, better internet. Keller's Magic APIs describe a legal path to getting there. My own work on Competitive Compatibility (nee Adversarial Interoperability) describes how we'll STAY there.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability&lt;/a&gt;

Because monopolies are good at subverting regulation, so any Magic API rule would be brittle - dependent on the tech companies not sabotaging those APIs by moving the important data-flows away from the mandatory APIs.

That's why we have to strip monopolists of the power to ask a court to block interoperators: take away the wildly distorted copyright, patent, terms of service and other legal doctrines that Big Tech ignored during its ascent, but now enforces against would-be competitors.

With both interop mandates and a legal right for new entrants to force interoperability through technical means, tech giants will face consequences if they subvert antimonopoly rules.

The choice becomes: either respect the intent of a mandate and preserve interop; &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; be plunged into a chaotic arms-race with competitors who switch to scraping, bots, and reverse-engineering.

All of this is incredibly wonkish, a highly specialized debate that involves highly technical propositions about how digital technology works today, how it used to work and how it might work - layered atop a similar, highly technical understanding of antitrust law.

The Venn overlap of "deep understanding of digital tech" and "deep understanding of antitrust debates" isn't so much a slice as it is a sphincter, and the debate has been equally narrow, but when it's railbaron time, you get trustbusters.

The tech monopoly/interop debate is going mainstream. Francis Fukuyama and his colleagues at the Stanford Working Group on Platform Scale have proposed an intervention similar to the ACCESS Act, where trusted third parties mediate between monopolists, new entrants and users.

The Stanford proposal calls them "middleware companies," but they're conceptually interchangeable with the idea of a "data fiduciary": companies that act as referees when a new co-op, startup or nonprofit wants to plug into a monopolist's service.

&lt;a href="https://pairagraph.com/dialogue/4124f75013da40038c4cbff5ebdaaa51/3"&gt;https://pairagraph.com/dialogue/4124f75013da40038c4cbff5ebdaaa51/3&lt;/a&gt;

This is clearly an idea whose time has come - it's present in the EU's DMA and the US Access Act, and latent in the UK CMA report:

&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study#final-report"&gt;https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study#final-report&lt;/a&gt;

Importantly, it's an approach that recognizes the distinctive character of tech - taking account of the power of interop to break open walled gardens and unravel network effects.

What's especially interesting about this work is that it appears to have been developed in parallel to pre-existing work from Masnick and Keller (and me) - it's a case of convergence between the tech-policy world and the broader world of policy.

After all, while Masnick and Keller's work is well known inside of tech policy, that's just our obscure, nerdy corner of the policy world - now they're escaping that corner, becoming self-evident to people from traditional policy backgrounds.

&lt;a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2020/article/capitalisn-t-francis-fukuyama-s-proposal-rein-big-tech"&gt;https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2020/article/capitalisn-t-francis-fukuyama-s-proposal-rein-big-tech&lt;/a&gt;

My hope is that the trend continues - that we see ideas about Competitive Compatibility/Adversarial Interop join the idea of API mandates, so that we produce durable anti-monopoly systems, not just anti-monopoly rules.

Most important, though, is restoring an appreciation for the importance of interoperability in &lt;em&gt;preventing&lt;/em&gt; monopolies and promoting technological self-determination for communities and individuals.

Because such a sensibility can escape the legislative world and be enacted via fast-moving, easier-to-use policy  tools. For example, we could (&lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;!) make interop a feature of all government procurement rules.

No school district should buy devices for students without securing the right to sideload the apps they need on them - imagine buying 50,000 Ipads at public expense and then having Apple boot the app you rely on out of the App Store!

Likewise, no district should buy Google Classroom without securing a legally binding guarantee not to block interoperators who want to integrate other ed-tech services into the curriculum, with or without Google's cooperation.

Procurement and interop are as old as the Civil War, when the Union Army demanded firearms and ammo that had multiple manufacturers. As the state-level Net Neutrality rules (which bar governments from using non-neutral ISPs) showed us, procurement can shape markets.

Procurement is just for starters. Right now, tech companies caught breaking the law are handed down fines that are less than the profits their lawbreaking generated - instead, we could demand interop as part of any settlement.

One major barrier to interop is contract law: terms of service, EULAs, noncompetes, arbitration, etc. States wield enormous power over contracting terms: states can declare certain contractual language against public policy and thus unenforceable.

If, say, California were to pass a rule nullifying the mountain of abusive garbage that has become standard in digital "contracts," it would be in a position to export fair usage terms to the country in just the same way it exports robust emissions standards.

Antittrust is primarily a federal manner (that's why 40 years of federal antitrust malpractice has been such a disaster). But every level of government, down to your local school board, can make a meaningful difference in tech antitrust.

Digital technology's inescapable, marvellous, terrifying flexibility can be translated into so many unique, powerful weapons for transforming the industry and empowering communities to control their digital lives and seize the means of computation.

&lt;h1&gt;Signed copies of HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/20/escape-velocity/#htdsc"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Last summer, Onezero published my book HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM - an antimonopoly critique of Big Tech that's skeptical of its self-serving claims to have perfected digital manipulation and looks to monopoly to explain our weird discourse.

&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59&lt;/a&gt;

Last month, Onezero published the book between covers, with an all-new additional chapter. It's a beautiful little book, perfect for people whose screen-burned eyes seek rest in a physical object.

&lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism/9781736205907"&gt;https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism/9781736205907&lt;/a&gt;

Yesterday, Dark Delicacies, my local bookseller, got its shipment of the book, and I popped in and signed 25 of them. You can order a signed copy here (with a personalized inscription, if you'd like!):

&lt;h1&gt;K-Zombies (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/26/meaningful-zombies/#oracles"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When you and your friends put your fingers on the ouija board planchette and it starts moving around, there's a chance your friends are just yanking your chain - but just as possible is that your friends are experiencing the ideomotor response.

That's when your unconscious mind directs your muscles without your conscious knowledge. The movement of the planchette doesn't tell you what's going on in the spirit world, but it does tell you something about the internal weather of your friend's psyche, fears and hopes.

Our narratives are social-scale planchettes, directed by mass ideomotor response. When a fake news story takes hold, it reveals a true fact: namely, the shared, internal models of how the world really works.

Fake news is an oracle, in other words.

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2019/07/cory-doctorow-fake-news-is-an-oracle/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2019/07/cory-doctorow-fake-news-is-an-oracle/&lt;/a&gt;

There's no spirit-realm directing planchettes. Supernatural phenomena are nonsense, in all their guises. Mediums are fraudsters or deluded - and so are soothsayers who claim to be able to predict the future. That goes for fortune-tellers and futurists alike.

A shocking number of self-described "rational" science fiction writers share the delusional view that they can predict the future. These pulp Nostradamii point to "predictions" of sf that have "come true" and claim to have an inside line on the world of tomorrow.

Sf &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; an important relationship to the future, though! It can be a planchette: all the futures imagined by all the sf writers are a kind of mutation-space, and the fitness factor that determines whether a story thrives or sinks is whether it captures public imagination.

Sf writers and readers are a means for society to reflect back, amplify and examine our unarticulated hopes and fears about our &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; technology. Sf doesn't predict the future, but sf readers and writers do an excellent job of predicting the present.

And since the present is the standing wave where the past is being transformed into the future, knowing about the present can be a source of insights into what's coming - and not just because sf reveals what's going on in the present, but also because it influences it.

People who are captured by imaginative, futuristic parables about the problems and possibilities of technology acquire a set of intuition-pumps for coping with the future when it arrives, reflexive views and actions about what the future demands of us.

Gene Rodenberry didn't predict the Motorola flip-phone. Rather, when a generation of Motorola designers and engineers were asked to make a mobile communications device their minds immediately flew to the Star Trek communicators they grew up with.

Thinking of fantastic fiction as measurement device and influence machine is a productive way to pick apart the meaning of literary trends.

As I wrote in my intro to the bicentennial re-release of FRANKENSTEIN, the rise and fall of Shelley's book tracks to the rise and fall of fears related to the book's various themes:

&lt;a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1974387"&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1974387&lt;/a&gt;

So what are we to make of K-zombies? Korean pop culture is experiencing a golden age of zombie movies, games, comics and other media.

&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-02-23/zombies-are-everywhere-south-korea-fears"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-02-23/zombies-are-everywhere-south-korea-fears&lt;/a&gt;

Zombies have a lot of different themes, of course, and some are easy to map to the current situation: the fear of contagion and the need to distance yourself from loved ones who have become infected. The parallels to covid hardly need explaining.

But the K-zombie phenomenon predates the pandemic, and zombie stories aren't merely contagion stories - they're often stories about the lurking bestiality of nearly everyone around us.

That's behind stories like The Walking Dead, about the propensity of all our "normal" friends and neighbors to transform into an insensate, rampaging mob. These zombie stories are a throwback to the "cozy catastrophes" of John Wyndham and co:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/29/grifters-gonna-grift/#wyndhamesque"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/29/grifters-gonna-grift/#wyndhamesque&lt;/a&gt;

These are stories of racial and class anxiety, of xenophobia and the literal othering of someone who &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to be just like you but is actually a secret monster. Again, on a divided peninsula, it's not hard to see how stories of lurking otherness would catch hold.

Zombie stories are also stories about the fragility of social cohesion: stories about how we're never "all in this together" and how, when the chips are down, it'll be "the war of all against all." That, too, feels very zeitgeisty given recent South Korean politics.

South Korea has an ugly, authoritarian past that is at odds with its founding myth as the "good Korea," the "democratic Korea." But the post-war reconstruction of the country by the US elevated an elite to a position of near-total authority and impunity.

They abused this power in ghastly ways, running forced-labor camps for poor people and people with disabilities, with rampant physical and sexual abuse. Families who lost their loved ones were traumatized to learn that they'd ended up in the camps.

&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423131643/https://bigstory.ap.org/article/c22de3a565fe4e85a0508bbbd72c3c1b/ap-s-korea-covered-mass-abuse-killings-vagrants"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160423131643/https://bigstory.ap.org/article/c22de3a565fe4e85a0508bbbd72c3c1b/ap-s-korea-covered-mass-abuse-killings-vagrants&lt;/a&gt;

These forced-labor camps (which continue in a slightly modified form to this day) supplied slaves to chaebols, the conglomerates that represent the country on a world stage. Unsurprisingly, the leadership of these companies is also grossly corrupt:

&lt;a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2052871/samsung-chief-jailed-for-2-5-years-over-corruption-scandal"&gt;https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2052871/samsung-chief-jailed-for-2-5-years-over-corruption-scandal&lt;/a&gt;

Korea is also riven by messianic cults, and the leaders of these cults have close ties to the Korean political class, an incredibly politically destabilizing fact that has caused recent Korean governments to collapse:

&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37971085"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37971085&lt;/a&gt;

South Korea, in other words, isn't just haunted by the spectre of aggression from the north - but also by the possibility of internal rupture. It has a huge, authoritarian secret police force that has been caught secretly meddling in electoral politics.

Far from reining in this spookocracy, the South Korean political class has tried to hand them even MORE powers, with LESS oversight. Today is the fifth anniversary of the Korean opposition's filibuster to stop the worst of these.

(Seo Ki-Ho, a politician with the affectionate nickname "Milhouse" for his resemblance to the Simpsons character read the Korean edition of my novel LITTLE BROTHER into the record during the filibuster!)

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/CcHHpWmUMAAyJk-1.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2016/02/26/south-korean-lawmakers-stage-filibuster-to-protest-anti-terror-bill-read-from-little-brother/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2016/02/26/south-korean-lawmakers-stage-filibuster-to-protest-anti-terror-bill-read-from-little-brother/&lt;/a&gt;

This othering is also sharply illustrated in the country's culture of misogynistic voyeurism, which goes beyond "upskirt" videos and includes a roaring trade in videos captured with hidden cameras in toilets, changing rooms and hotel rooms.

It's hard to overstate the reach of this practice, and its political salience: it has provoked a vast mass-movement of women and allies demanding an end to the practice and a reckoning with institutional sexism:

&lt;a href="https://www.khaosodenglish.com/culture/net/2020/10/21/voyeurs-are-selling-photos-of-women-at-the-protest-online/"&gt;https://www.khaosodenglish.com/culture/net/2020/10/21/voyeurs-are-selling-photos-of-women-at-the-protest-online/&lt;/a&gt;

Zombies aren't ever just about contagion - they're also always an expression of a deep anxiety that your neighbors aren't what they seem, that in a pinch, they'll turn on you, and not just because they've been infected, but also to protect themselves and their comfort.

US zombie booms always have an element of this: 1950s (reds under the bed); 1980s (red menace redux); 2000s (immigration "crisis"), etc. It'd be amazing if the only thing driving K-zombies' popularity was the pandemic, or even less plausibly, a mere aesthetic coincidence.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;a name="luxury-goods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/datadividend.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Privacy is not property (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/26/meaningful-zombies/#luxury-goods"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When all you have is market orthodoxy, everything looks like a market failure. Take privacy: giant, rapacious corporations have instrumented the digital and physical worlds to spy on us all the time, so some people think they should pay us for our data.

There's a pretty rich theoretical history explaining why this "data dividend" is a stupid idea. First of all, private information isn't very property-like. And not  just because it shares all the problems of digital works (infinitely, instantaneously copyable at zero cost).

Private information makes for bad "property" because it is "owned" by multiple, overlapping parties who generally disagree about when and who to share it with. When you and I have a conversation, we both own the fact that the conversation took place.

What happens if I won't sell, but you will? Tech companies are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good at finding the cheapest seller of an information good, after all. For example, whenever you visit a "quality newspaper's" site, there's a real-time auction to bid on the right to show you ads.

Say there are 13 bidders for that right. One gets to show you an ad, but the other 12 get something too: your unique identifier and the fact that you read, say, the New York Times.

That fact is then sold on to garbage chumbox sites like Tabouleh, whose pitch to advertisers is "I can show your ads to NYT readers at 15% of the price that the Times charges." If the same fact is "owned" by lots of people, it's a commodity.

Buyers will find the lowest, least-discerning seller. What's more, you can't solve this by requiring consensus of all "owners" of a fact before it is disclosed - who owns the fact that your boss sexually harassed you: you or him? Does he get a veto over your disclosures?

Even if we could get property rights to work in privacy (which, for the record, we cannot), all we'd manage to do is transform privacy into a luxury good wherein poor people are coerced into selling their data for pennies, as Malavika Jayaram reminds us:

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MalJayaram/status/1231373834458025984"&gt;https://twitter.com/MalJayaram/status/1231373834458025984&lt;/a&gt;

Data dividends also require someone to set prices on data, and chances are that price will be set by a privacy-invading tech company or a regulator in thrall to them:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/why-getting-paid-your-data-bad-deal"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/why-getting-paid-your-data-bad-deal&lt;/a&gt;

And whatever the price, it won't capture the true cost, as Hayley Tsukayama reminds us: "Low-income Americans and often communities of color should not be incentivized to pour more data into a system that already exploits them and uses data to discriminate against them."

"Privacy is a human right, not a commodity."

It's not too late to end "pay for privacy," because, as Dipayan Ghosh says, behavioral data is "temporally sensitive" - companies need more of it all the time, meaning we can still push back.

&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/07/data-privacy-surveillance-law-marketers.html"&gt;https://slate.com/technology/2020/07/data-privacy-surveillance-law-marketers.html&lt;/a&gt;

To get this right, we have to stop pretending that data makes good property and that therefore markets will solve data problems. And just because data isn't property, it doesn't follow that it isn't valuable.

Far from it: the most valuable things we know of (human beings) are not property precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; treating them as property would cheapen them. We humans are so valuable that we have a complex set of rules just for us.

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/21/intellectual.property"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/21/intellectual.property&lt;/a&gt;

My daughter isn't my property, but I have an interest in her. So does my wife, and her grandparents, and her teachers and school district, and Child Protective Services...and so does she. This "interest"-based system acknowledged the complex web of overlapping claims.

We have a whole discipline - one that doesn't intersect with markets at all - that describes these relations, with specialized concepts like "nurturance rights" and "self-determination rights" (thanks to Rory Pickens for introducing me to these concepts).

All of these points and more are made in "Why data ownership is the wrong approach to protecting privacy," a 2019 Brookings Institute paper by Cameron F Kerry and John B Morris, who relate them to pending legislation and relevant case-law.

&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/06/26/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/"&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/06/26/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/&lt;/a&gt;

"By licensing the use of their information in exchange for monetary consideration, we may be worse off than under the current notice-and-choice regime...A property-based system also disregards interests besides property that individuals have in personal information."

While Kat Leyh is best known for her work on LUMBERJANES, her solo debut, SNAPDRAGON (Firstsecond, 2020) is an outstanding work that combines LUMBERJANES' madcap kitchen-sink approach with a narrative simplicity that makes it a joy to read.

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250171122"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250171122&lt;/a&gt;

Snapdragon is a young woman living with her single mom - an adoring, overstretched parent who's working multiple jobs while attending nursing college. Snap - named for her mother's favorite flower - is lonely and isolated, but that's about to change.

Everyone knows that there's a witch that lives on the outskirts of Snap's town, and Snap is pretty sure that Good Boy, her missing, beloved three-legged dog, has ended up in the witch's cottage, sure to be eaten.

Snap steels herself to rescue GB and bursts in on the witch, only to discover a quirky old lady in green Crocs with a black eye-patch, who's been taking excellent care of GB - and who introduces herself as Jack, and Jack is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not a witch.

Jack, rather, is an amateur bone builder who brings home roadkill, buries it until it is reduced to a skeleton, and then articulates the skeletons and sells them online. Snap finds the hobby incredibly exciting and pesters/sweet talks Jack into letting her help.

Snap's isolation is coming to an end. Not only is she discovering a new passion with Jack - she's also found a friend, Lulu, a young boy who comes out as trans and becomes a young girl.

But there's a lot more going on beneath the surface. Snap finds an old photo of Jack with her grandmother, both of them young and in love - and learns two secrets: one: Jack really IS a witch: and two, Jack and Snap's granny were once deeply in love.

There's so much &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; going on in Snapdragon - a technical story about anatomy and the preservation of animal remains, an historical story about intersectional prejudice, several kinds of ghost story and at least three coming-out stories...

It's a story about heroism and loyalty, friendship and family, secrets and the meaning of both a good life and a good death.

And yet, for all of these moving parts, it has the elegant simplicity of a YA tale, a plot that never lets up, and incredibly likeable characters.

I read it in one sitting, and then, having discovered that she has a new book out for 2021 - THIRSTY MERMAIDS - I asked my comic shop to order me a copy.

&lt;h1&gt;How unions de-risk work (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/17/there-once-was-a-union-maid/#solidarity-forever"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Yesterday, I published an essay about how monopolies beget monopolies: when deregulation kicked off a wave of pharma mergers, the new pharma oligopoly gained the power to raise prices on hospitals.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/16/wage-theft/#excessive-buyer-power"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/16/wage-theft/#excessive-buyer-power&lt;/a&gt;

The hospitals weren't able to form a cartel to insist on better prices: the US antitrust law created by Ronald Reagan's court sorcerer Robert Bork is incredibly tolerant of monopolist price-rigging, but violently opposed to cartels that price-rig.

Rather than forming a cartel, the hospitals gobbled each other up to create monopolies. If the CEOs of six hospitals insist on better drug prices, it's illegal. If the presidents of six hospitals (all owned by the same monopolist) do the same thing, it's fine.

Big Hospital wasn't merely better positioned to demand better drug prices from Big Pharma, they were also able to charge more to the fragmented, decentralized health insurance industry.

Predictably, this kicked off a wave of mergers that produced Big Insurance, a monopolized world that gives most Americans between zero and two insurers who'll take their business.

Freed from the risk of losing customers and bulked up to meet hospital monopolies on even footings, insurance companies could both insist on lower payouts to hospitals and &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; premiums from patients. And at last we had some sort of equilibrium.

Pharma companies could charge more for drugs, but not too much more. Hospitals could lower the standard of care, raise prices, and squeeze workers' wages and working conditions. Insurance companies could cut payments to hospitals, raise prices and hike co-pays.

Everyone got what they wanted, except for two groups that can't form monopolies that push back against this monopoly-dominated industry:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the "monopolist" safeguarding patients' interests was the state: democratically elected lawmakers who relied on voters for re-election. The massive increase in corporate campaign finance was attended by steady erosion of political loyalty to the public interest.

And so the public lost its champion, and prices went up and quality went down and redress was whittled away to performative apologies after crises of too great a magnitude to be ignored, accompanied by fines that were mere fractions of the profits from corruption.

Meanwhile, workers' champions were their unions: solidarity organizations that corrected the negotiating imbalance between employers and employees by presenting a united front.

That unity extended beyond the gates of a single employer. Picket-line crossing was a grave sin, so if your hotel's maids went out on strike, the Teamsters wouldn't deliver your groceries and the taxi cabs wouldn't pick up at your entrance.

And related trades were able to bargain together: in Hollywood, the writers and actors and tradespeople would start each contract season by visiting the weakest studio as a body and demand the best deal, then require parity from other studios in turn.

Since the Reagan years, union power has been drained off. For example, the way Hollywood unions negotiate has been flipped on its head. Now, the &lt;em&gt;studios&lt;/em&gt; visit the weakest union as a body and demand the most labor concessions, then take those to the other unions in turn.

It's been generations since union power was a given, and we haven't just lost our power, we've lost our imaginations - the sense of what is possible, what we are owed, how the system could work. We've learned to take precarity and low wages as a given.

That's why Reina Sultan's "8 People Describe How Unions Changed Their Lives" for Vice is so important: not because it is heartwarming (though it is) but because it is ripe with possibility, the recovered wisdom of a fallen civilization.

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxqvm/why-unions-are-good-first-hand-accounts-of-how-unions-change-lives"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxqvm/why-unions-are-good-first-hand-accounts-of-how-unions-change-lives&lt;/a&gt;

These eight workers describe how joining a union turned precarity into certainty. How the hotels they worked for had to promise to hire them back after the pandemic lifted. How they were promised ten hours of uninterrupted sleep between shifts.

How their employers had to accommodate their disabilities. How they were guaranteed health insurance that covered their whole families. How they were protected from being arbitrarily fired, and guaranteed severance pay when they were laid off.

These guarantees have a common theme: they de-risk being a worker and make it riskier to be an employer. Much of our day-to-day life is a series of negotiations over who should bear the risk that things will turn out bad.

Think of all the corporate bailouts, how these are "socialism for shareholders, capitalism for workers." When the fed bails out banks and employers but not mortgage holders and workers, they move risk off the finance-sector's balance sheet and stick it on our balance sheet.

When you run a business, you assume risks. Maybe you have a slow Saturday and end up paying workers to hang around with nothing to do. If you can book a worker's Sat, but unilaterally send them home two hours into their shift because it's slow, you shift your risk onto them.

The worker has to be available for you, but you don't have to use that availability. Likewise disability accommodations: when you hire and train a worker, you face the risk that they will become disabled, permanently or temporarily, on or off the job.

When that happens, you might have to pay to change the physical environment so they can do their job, or give them disability pay. If you can just fire them, you shift the risk onto the worker, and off your own books.

Every benefit described by workers in Way's article is risk being shifted from workers back onto employers. The right not to be summarily fired means workers aren't at risk from vindictive, bad bosses. It also means employers may struggle to shed "low-performing" workers.

It's a good reminder of the "struggle" in "class struggle." These risks are, by their nature, zero-sum. To decrease the risk of being stuck with a bad employee, you have to &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the risk of an employee being targeted by a bad manager. There's no win-win here.

Sure, employers will say that they share the workers' interest in rooting out bad managers, but there is an inescapable contradiction between reserving the right to fire anyone, for any reason, and making sure workers aren't unjustly fired.

The same goes for every benefit articulated by union members. If you're an electrician who wants to be able to get home, sleep and go back to work without being interrupted for ten straight hours, you push risk onto your employer.

Meanwhile, if you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; have that right, your employer gets to shove risk onto you. For example, they could underinvest in upgrades and preventative maintenance, knowing that when things break down, they can summon you to get them working again, without paying any overtime.

The project of worker solidarity comes down to this foundational question: who should bear which risks? Would you rather have bad bosses firing people over personal vendettas, or co-workers who are hard to fire even though they're not great at their jobs?

We don't need to pretend that moving risk onto employers' side of the ledger always produces better outcomes. It doesn't. Workers can be jerks, too. But an individual bad boss has the power to do enormous harm to their entire workforce over a long term.

Think of all the people maimed, killed and sickened in Amazon's warehouses because of one individual's willingness and ability to shift risk off his balance sheet and onto theirs.

It's true that an especially toxic unionized worker could make life miserable for many, many other workers - but that's still a better outcome than an especially toxic CEO, not least because unions give workers the power to address bad workers even when management won't.

Is it possible for things to be overbalanced, for too much risk to be shifted off of worker's balance sheets and onto employers' side of the ledger? Sure, theoretically. But that is a situation so far removed from workplace reality today that it's practically a fairy-tale.

And if we're really worried about too much risk landing on employers, then we can go back to the peoples' source of power: democratic governance. Unions represent a power-bloc that can (but don't always) hold politicians to account.

It's hard to imagine any political path to checking corporate power that doesn't include organized groups of workers &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; organized groups of citizens, working for political change.

If health insurance, disability accommodations, retirement pay, parental leave and other sources of workplace risk are moved onto the public's balance sheet, they cease to be things that workers or employers need to argue about. They're just a given.

Think of it this way: bosses and workers don't fight over who will pay to pave the roads to the business. They don't fight over who will fight fires, or allocate RF frequency for the office wireless network. These risks are moved to the public ledger, where they belong.

This kind of political change is also hard to imagine, after 40 years of Reaganomics. But unionization makes it more achievable, because another word for "risk" is "profit." Shifting risk from workers onto bosses shifts money from bosses to workers.

Monopolized employers extract monopoly rents from their customers and gouge monopoly concessions from their workers. This isn't just extra money to send to shareholders - it's also extra money to spend in the political realm, blocking reforms that benefit everyone.

That's how we get wage stagnation and ghouls like Manchin and Sinema tanking the $15 minimum wage. The money extracted from workers was sent to these politicians so they would vote to make it possible to keep extracting money from workers.

Unionization - workplace justice - doesn't win the war for political justice. But it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; cut the enemy's supply lines, deprive them of the ammo they're using to fight us.

&lt;h1&gt;Leaked NYPD "goon squad" manual (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/07/cruelty-by-design/#blam-blam-blam"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In New York City, the summer 2020 #BLM uprising became a grotesque spectacle, as legions of ultraviolent cops committed mass-scale, criminal human rights violations, spawning a new subgenre of viral video: the NYPD BLM violence video.

During and after this period, public attention focused on the systemic nature of the NYPD's lawlessness, like the fact that the cops' disciplinary records were held secret, obscuring the repeat offenders.

Indeed, Propublica's brave publication of these records demonstrated that the force is riddled with violent, habitual sadists.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/27/ip/#nypd-who"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/27/ip/#nypd-who&lt;/a&gt;

Propublica did incredible work, showing that cops who commits a strings of violent human rights abuses and cost the taxpayer vast fortunes in legal settlements aren't disqualified from promotions - these monsters constitute the NYPD's top brass.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/10/booksellers-vs-big-tech/#50a"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/10/booksellers-vs-big-tech/#50a&lt;/a&gt;

Propublica also delved deep into the NYPD's sham of a disciplinary process, for example, documenting the continued use of illegal choke-holds by officers, primarily against Black men, and how police officials did nothing to enforce their own policies.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/21/i-cant-breathe/#chokeholds"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/21/i-cant-breathe/#chokeholds&lt;/a&gt;

All of this leads up to impunity. As Propublica went on to report, out of the hundreds the NYPD officers caught on video committing crimes against protesters, only &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; were brought up for discipline, despite video evidence and eyewitness reports.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/18/news-worthy/#nypd-black-and-blue"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/18/news-worthy/#nypd-black-and-blue&lt;/a&gt;

The cherry on the cake: last month, Propublica revealed the existence of a secretive, tax-funded slushfund that pays out millions to hire white-shoe lawyers to defend the cops who are so dirty the city refuses to defend them:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/26/overfitness-factor/#heads-you-lose-tails-they-win"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/26/overfitness-factor/#heads-you-lose-tails-they-win&lt;/a&gt;

Latent in all of this discussion is the assumption - on the part of NYPD critics &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; apologists - that the cops who commit these crimes are breaking their own rules. But as it turns out, that's not true.

Today, The Intercept published the leaked, secret, destroy-after-reading procedural manuals for the NYPD's Strategic Response Group, an ultra-secretive goon squad formed by former chief Bill Bratton in 2015.

We don't know how big the SRG is - it's a secret - but we know that its inaugural budget was $13m in 2015 and today, it's nearly $90m. As Alice Speri and John Bolger write, the crimes we witnessed last summer are literally straight out of the SRG's playbook.

That thing where bike cops kettle a group of protesters, hoist their bikes up to their chest, forming a moving fence, and then beat the shit out of  protesters as they advance? That's not the result of undertraining - it's a maneuver they regularly drill.

When the BLM uprising began, the NYPD's chief and commissioner both pledged that the SRG - theoretically designed to maintain order during mass riots, not political protests - wouldn't be involved.

They lied.

"Investigators found a disproportionate number of SRG officers accused of wrongdoing to have exceeded their legal authority, when compared with the wider department."

Despite its $90m budget and estimated 700 cops, it's not clear why SRG exists at all. The NY AG's office said SRG shouldn't be used on protesters because they're supposed to fight terrorism, but the NYPD already has an expensive, heavily resourced Counterterrorism Bureau.

One thing we do know about the SRG: they have a huge intelligence wing. Before deployments, SRG officers are briefed on "group size, planned arrests, key members of the protest group, and the group’s hierarchy," and other intel. They go in with a plan.

That's the point: the violence isn't the result of rogue cops ignoring their training. It's the result of cops doing &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what they're trained to do.

If you doubt it, read the manuals.

Learn about the Bike Line Arrest Manuever, or BLAM, in which officers "shout 'BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!' as they advance," and "[take] control of subjects head by clinching your hands and arms behind the head of subject and bringing head against your chest."

This is exactly what Human Rights Watch documented in their report on a Jun 4, 2020 "planned assault" in the Bronx. NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea called the chaotic violence of that assault as "a plan which was executed nearly flawlessly." He wasn't lying.

&lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/30/us-new-york-police-planned-assault-bronx-protesters"&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/30/us-new-york-police-planned-assault-bronx-protesters&lt;/a&gt;

The authors warn that any reform that results in disbanding the SRG won't be enough: the NYPD has a long history of dissolving its most criminal units and then reforming them with a new name, new insignia and even bigger budgets.

They give the final word to Joo-Hyun Kang of Communities United for Police Reform, who says that the real problem isn't the SRG, it's "the hyper-militarization, the hyper-aggressive policing tactics. That's not an SRG problem only, that’s an NYPD problem"

&lt;h1&gt;Door Dashers organize app-defeating solidarity (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/07/cruelty-by-design/#declinenow"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

"Gig economy" is a polite term for "worker misclassification" - a way to violate labor law by pretending that your employees are actually independent contractors.

Unsurprisingly, the companies that cheat their employees also cheat their other suppliers. Doordash spent the entirety of the crisis preying on beloved, endangered local restaurants with a string of outright frauds:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle&lt;/a&gt;

By colluding with Google, Doordash was able to interopose itself between restaurants and diners, making it nearly impossible for us to transact together without giving Doordash a cut that exceeded the restaurant's margin, making every order a money-loser.

The grimly hilarious part is that Doordash &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; lost money - billions! - during the crisis. They lost money while driving restaurants to bankruptcy. Small wonder we cheered whenever a viral story of a restaurateur turning the tables went viral.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza&lt;/a&gt;

Why do investors pump billions into a money-losing enterprise? They're betting that a pile of shit this big &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have a pony under it somewhere. Specifically, they're betting that Doordash can squeeze its workers and other suppliers so hard that they begin to turn a profit.

Doordash isn't exactly subtle about its plan to attain profitability by destroying its suppliers. When all the restaurants have been driven to extinction, it plans to replace them with "ghost kitchens."

These are airless shipping containers filled with people who used to own restaurants who have to &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; Doordash for the privilege of turning out meals for delivery:

&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doordash-ghost-kitchen-silicon-valley-chick-fil-a-photos-2019-11"&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/doordash-ghost-kitchen-silicon-valley-chick-fil-a-photos-2019-11&lt;/a&gt;

Ghost kitchens are the terminus of all gig economy delivery plays, not just Doordash. If anything, the Ubereats version is even more sinister, as you'd expect from disgraced former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who's heading it up:

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpgd7/the-mystery-of-fcking-good-pizza-travis-kalanick-cloudkitchens-future-foods-delivery-restaurants"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpgd7/the-mystery-of-fcking-good-pizza-travis-kalanick-cloudkitchens-future-foods-delivery-restaurants&lt;/a&gt;

The other cost-center for Doordash is its workforce, the misclassified employees that it pretends are contractors. Again, the writing was on the wall here from the beginning. From day one, Doordash engaged in utterly shameless wage-theft:

&lt;a href="https://www.mselaborlaw.com/news/doordash-pay-25-million-tip-theft-lawsuit"&gt;https://www.mselaborlaw.com/news/doordash-pay-25-million-tip-theft-lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;

Doordash, like Uber, lures workers in with high initial rates, subsidized by its investors' cash. This is Doordash's version of the Amazon flywheel: more drivers mean faster delivery means more orders means more restaurants dependent on Doordash means more drivers.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/amazonflywheel.jpg"/&gt;

Then, as its suppliers become dependent on the company, it tightens the screws. Hundreds of thousands of Uber drivers discovered this the hard way when their wages were suddenly, unaccountably slashed, as Uber slashed the investor subsidy that lured them behind the wheel.

Two of those drivers were Dave Levy and Nikos Kanelopoulos, who met when they were both Uber drivers and made the jump to Doordash together. Now that Doordash is slashing their wages, they're determined to fight back, using the lessons they learned in the Uberpocalypse.

As Brody Ford writes for Bloomberg, the two have founded a driver solidarity movement called #DeclineNow, which calls on drivers to reject jobs that offer rates so low that drivers could actually lose money on them.

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/doordash-workers-are-trying-to-game-the-algorithm-to-increase-pay"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/doordash-workers-are-trying-to-game-the-algorithm-to-increase-pay&lt;/a&gt;

The pair have observed that the Doordash system functions as a labor auction: if a job doesn't attract a driver, the job is republished with a higher rate, and a higher one, and a higher one, until a driver bites.

There are few enough drivers in their home area of Lehigh Valley, PA that they say they've been able to effectively raise wages for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; drivers, and the #DeclineNow forum they run has 40,000 members.

The squirming awkwardness of the company's spokesdroid is delicious, as Doordash insists on the fiction that drivers are contractors who can take jobs or not, while simultaneously detailing all the ways the app punishes drivers who don't take these money-losing jobs.

The company has to walk a fine line: bursting the illusion that its employees are really contractors - say, by firing them for refusing jobs - would waste the millions they spent passing California's Prop 22, a worker misclassification initiative that cost $200m all in.

But they have other tricks up their sleeves: for example, the company withholds the amount tips you offer when you order your food. That means that a $3 job might be worth $3, or it might be worth $13 with tip. Drivers call Doordash "Tony's Casino" in homage to CEO Tony Xu.

Every gig economy company is a mirage in search of a monopoly. Any concessions the workforce wins are an existential crisis for these money losers, which is why Uber is once again planning to hide job payouts from drivers until they accept the work:

&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-may-stop-letting-drivers-see-destinations-16078491.php"&gt;https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-may-stop-letting-drivers-see-destinations-16078491.php&lt;/a&gt;

One dirty trick Doordash hasn't tried (yet): antitrust. You see, once workers are misclassified as "small businesses," any effort to raise their wages is legally indistinguishable from forming a cartel to raise prices, one of the few antitrust areas the DoJ still punishes.

If you're a driver, customer or citizen, you can sign onto this change.org petition in support of a (laughably, sadly) minimum standard of decency in the company's dealings with its drivers:

&lt;img alt="A haystack with a magnification box showing a needle whose tip sports a lens-flare." src="https://craphound.com/images/needlehaystack.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Observatory of Anonymity (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/21/re-identification/#pseudonymity"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

"Wanting it badly is not enough" could be the title of a postmortem on the century's tech-policy battles. Think of the crypto wars: yeah, it would be super cool if we had ciphers that worked perfectly except when "bad guys" used them, but that's not ever going to happen.

Another area is anonymization of large data-sets. There are undeniably cool implications for a system that allows us to gather and analyze lots of data on how people interact with each other and their environments without compromising their privacy.

But "cool" isn't the same as "possible" because wanting it badly is not enough. In the mid-2010s, privacy legislation started to gain real momentum, and privacy regulators found themselves called upon to craft compromises to pass important new privacy laws.

Those compromises took the form of "anonymized data" carve-outs, leading to the passage of laws like the GDPR, which strictly regulated processing "personally identifying information" but was a virtual free-for-all for "de-identified" data that had been "anonymized."

There was just one teensy problem with this compromise: de-identifying data is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard, and it only gets harder over time. Say the NHS releases prescribing data: date, doctor, prescription, and a random identifier. That's a super-useful data-set for medical research.

And say the next year, Addison-Lee or another large minicab company suffers a breach (no human language contains the phrase "as secure as minicab IT") that contains many of the patients' journeys that resulted in that prescription-writing.

Merge those two data-sets and you re-identify many of the patients in the data. Subsequent releases and breaches compound the problem, and there's nothing the NHS can do to either predict or prevent a breach by a minicab company.

Even if the NHS is confident in its anonymization, it can never be confident in the sturdiness of that anonymity over time.

Worse: the NHS really &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; be confident in its anonymization. Time and again, academics have shown that anonymized data from the start.

Re-identification attacks are subtle, varied, and very, very hard to defend against:

&lt;a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/precautionary.pdf"&gt;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/precautionary.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

Worse, they're highly automatable:

&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3&lt;/a&gt;

And it's true in practice as well as in theory:

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html&lt;/a&gt;

When this pointed out to the (admittedly hard-working and torn) privacy regulators, they largely shrugged their shoulders and expressed a groundless faith that somehow this would be fixed in the future. Privacy should not be a faith-based initiative.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2014/07/09/big-data-should-not-be-a-faith-based-initiative/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2014/07/09/big-data-should-not-be-a-faith-based-initiative/&lt;/a&gt;

Today, we continue to see the planned releases of large datasets with assurances that they have been anonymized. It's common for terms of service to include your "consent" to have your data shared once it has been de-identified. This is a meaningless proposition.

To show just how easy re-identification can be, researchers at Imperial College and the Université catholique de Louvain have released The Observatory of Anonymity, a web-app that shows you how easily you can be identified in a data-set.

&lt;a href="https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/observatory/"&gt;https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/observatory/&lt;/a&gt;

Feed the app your country and region, birthdate, gender, employment and education status and it tells you how many people share those characteristics. For example, my identifiers boil down to a 1-in-3 chance of being identified.

(Don't worry: all these calculations are done in your browser and the Observatory doesn't send any of your data to a server)

If anything, The Observatory is generous to anonymization proponents. "Anonymized" data often include identifiers like the first half of a post-code.

You can read more about The Observatory's methods in the accompanying Nature paper, "Estimating the success of re-identifications in incomplete datasets using generative models."

&lt;img alt="A US $100 bill; in the center are angled congressional portraits of Josh Hawley and Marjorie Taylor Greene superimposed over a can of spam. The $100 figures on the face of the bill have been crudely altered in pink Comic Sans, adding several zeroes and replacing the word HUNDRED with ZILLION." src="https://craphound.com/images/hawleygreenefundraiser.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hawley and Taylor Greene faked their donor-surge (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/21/re-identification/#jan-6-fraud"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

After the Jan 6 insurrection, there were tons of demoralizing stories about how much pro-insurrection lawmakers like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Josh Hawley were raising in small-dollar donations, suggesting a vast base supporting authoritarian overthrow of the US government.

But it turns out that those numbers were hugely and deliberately distorted by Taylor Greene and Hawley, as Propublica reveals in a new reporting from Isaac Arnsdorf and Derek Willis.

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-josh-hawley-and-marjorie-taylor-greene-juiced-their-fundraising-numbers"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-josh-hawley-and-marjorie-taylor-greene-juiced-their-fundraising-numbers&lt;/a&gt;

The report analyzes campaign finance disclosures from the pair and learns that they spent vast sums - $600,000 in total - renting out mailing lists from sleazy GOP operatives whose business is compiling databases of suckers who give whenever they're asked.

The cost of those donations is high even by GOP standards, where half the money donors cough up can be skimmed off by "consultants," and it echoes the tactics used by Trump to artificially goose his own fundraising figures through straight-up fraud:

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html&lt;/a&gt;

The lists in this case come from one of the GOP's leading sleazemongers, Bryan G Rudnick (though his company LGM Consulting Group), who attained notoriety by spamming Jewish voters in 2008 with warnings that an Obama victory would lead to another Holocaust.

Spending a lot of money to raise a little money sounds like a losing proposition, but only if you discount the value that comes from fronting the appearance of popularity and support that comes from grossing a fortune in small-dollar donations (nevermind the net).

Hawley and Taylor Greene's fundraisers were political theater, and they worked, sending progressives into a panic at the thought of a vast groundswell of support for insurrection, and reassuring conservatives who worried that the pair were too extreme to garner support.

It was a canny - but ultimately easily discovered - ruse.

&lt;img alt="The EU Flag. In the center of the ring of stars is a dancing Uncle Pennybags from the game Monopoly; he has removed his face to reveal a grinning skull beneath." src="https://craphound.com/images/eumonopoly.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What's wrong with EU's trustbusters (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/21/re-identification/#eu-antitrust"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In his latest newsletter, the campaigning journalist Nick Shaxson talks with former EU Commission Chief Competition Economist Tommaso Valletti: it's an eye-opening view into how European competition policy has failed so dismally and massively.

&lt;a href="https://thecounterbalance.substack.com/p/the-european-system-of-monopoly"&gt;https://thecounterbalance.substack.com/p/the-european-system-of-monopoly&lt;/a&gt;

Importantly, it's about the European course of the disease of corporatism, which was rooted in 1920s Austria and then made the leap to the University of Chicago where it mutated into a virulent, global plague.

The Austria-Chicago plague destroyed the "democratic theory" of fighting monopoly ("monopolies are bad because they concentrate power into too few hands") with the "consumer welfare theory" ("monopolies are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; bad if they make prices go up).

This neutered competition rules in two ways: first, it ended all enforcement predicated on harms to society (as opposed to consumers). Even if a merger or other anticompetitive act was unambiguously about forcing lower wages, say, competition law no longer got a look in.

Second, though, was that it forced opponents of mergers to prove that they would result in higher prices, and it defined the standard of proof: "proof" came in the form of complex mathematical models that only pro-monopoly partisans knew how to build or interpret.

Thus Valletti describes how any objection to a monopolistic act had to clear a series of gatekeepers: high-powered law firms that briefed economists ("useful fools") on how to present the most obviously anticompetitive mergers so they'd pass muster.

These lawyers would interpose themselves between Valletti and the economist-experts - he (in his capacity as a senior economist at a regulator) would ask another economist expert for clarification and the lawyer would jump in and say, "Don't answer that."

The enablers are drawn primarily from three firms: Charles River Associates, Compass Lexecon and RBB Economics, and, until recently, there was precious little pushback from NGOs who might be able to serve as a countervaling force.

But, as Valletti notes, there's some progress, for example, an intervention by Amnesty in opposition to the (idiotic) Google-Fitbit merger. We're going to need a lot more of that, though, thanks to the timidity of EU competition regulators.

Describing this timidity, Valletti says that his former colleagues face a "stigma attached to losing cases in court, of having decisions reversed" and that this makes the reluctant to take bold measures, particularly in tech.

Echoing James Comey (who called the coterie of prosecutors who never lost a case "The Chickenshit Club" for their lack of ambition), Valletti say, "If you are not losing cases in court, you are not being ambitious enough."

Which is not to say that there aren't NGOs in the mix - there are, on the side of monopolists, in the form of Koch Network think-tankies who handwave away rigorous academic work opposing mergers ("Professor So-And-So is wrong").

What these paid shills lack in rigor they make up for in brevity and approachability - they know a judge won't read a 50-page, peer-reviewed economic paper, so they rebut it with "a glossy pamphlet with three nice pages."

When the arguments do get technical, they enter the realm of absurdity. Key to antimonopoly enforcement is "relevant market defintiion" - before you call a company a monopolist, you have to say what they &lt;em&gt;monopolize&lt;/em&gt;.

The regulators give big companies the most amazing passes when it comes to this - for example, when Facebook was buying Instagram, it did not characterize the merger as affecting the social media market - rather, it said the "camera app" market was the one to look at.

All this market definition wrangling burns resources. To reverse this, Valletti proposes a new standard - not merely a shifting of the burden of proof that would force merging firms to prove that the merger WON'T be anticompetitive.

But also a requirement that firms prove that they can't get the same benefits &lt;em&gt;without merging&lt;/em&gt;: "can you prove that this merger is the only way to bring these benefits?"

Valletti: "You, Google, the most almighty firm in the world, why do you need to purchase Fitbit to achieve these benefits?  Can’t you do it yourself, with all the smart guys you have? And leave Fitbit on its own, or available for purchase by someone without your market power, as this will increase competition? Prove that you really cannot do it without buying Fitbit. It is beyond my comprehension. Show me. And leave Fitbit on its own, or available for purchase by someone without your market power, as this will increase competition? Prove that you really cannot do it without buying Fitbit. It is beyond my comprehension. Show me."

&lt;img alt="One frame from XKCD's 'Types of Scientific Papers' strip; the headline has been replaced with Hemingway's famous six-word story, 'For sale: baby shoes, never worn." src="https://craphound.com/images/xkcdmicrofic.png"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;XKCD's scientific microfiction meme (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/02/microfictional-auto-ethnography/#sci-micro-fi"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In 2008, I traveled to the world's largest scientific data-centers for a Nature story. No matter whether the labs were devoted to internet archiving, the human genome, or the Higgs boson, they had two things in common: vast server farms, and XKCD.

&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080903/full/455016a.html"&gt;https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080903/full/455016a.html&lt;/a&gt;

Randall Munroe's webcomic is so unabashedly geeky, so unafraid to be obscure or format-breaking, so affectionate and knowing about the triumphs and pitfalls of science that it is absolute catnip for scientists.

&lt;img alt="XKCD 2456, Types of Scientific Paper" src="https://craphound.com/images/types_of_scientific_paper_2x.png"/&gt;

Last week, Munroe published strip #2456, "Types of scientific paper," a 3x4 grid of thumbnails of journal articles with titles like, "We put a camera somewhere new" and "My colleague is wrong and I can finally prove it."

&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/2456/"&gt;https://xkcd.com/2456/&lt;/a&gt;

Even by XKCD standards, this is heavy scientist-bait. The research community has risen to the challenge, flooding the net with remixes that are, if anything, even better than the original: works of microfictional genius to rival Hemingway's "For sale: baby shoes, never worn."

Many of these have been collected on Bruce Sterling's Tumblr blogs, and, taken as a body, they constitute an act of wry, insightful auto-ethnography - self-criticism wrapped in humor that tells a story.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We counted how many people have a disease, here are maps with poor countries in red&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that if you call your research 'genetic epidemiology,' then people are surprisingly OK with eugenics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Stuff happened: a chronology 1910-1974&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They missed so much stuff, it's honestly embarrassing 1910-1974&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am so tired of stuff scholarship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wokeness is killing stuff scholarship! A senior scholar weighs in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The ocean is doing a bunch of weird stuff to this glacier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it doing that: the wild physics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it doing that: now with machine learning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found a glacier that's doing fine! Oh, wait, nevermind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did any of you guys take a statistics course?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's that? Let me see if I can see it from space&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why tech workers deserve condos with better walk scores&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design students' yurts will end poverty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supportive housing costs less than boiling poor people in oil and it's more efficient&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elders have rebuilt enough equity for a new round of predatory lending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighborhood gained wealth when rich people moved in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This city ended homelessness (for left-handed veterans with cats)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Attack Surface is a Locus Awards finalist (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/02/microfictional-auto-ethnography/#locus-awards"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The annual Locus Awards finalists have been announced and I am thrilled to pieces to see my novel ATTACK SURFACE, a standalone book in the Little Brother universe for adults, in the final ten for Best SF Novel!

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/05/2021-locus-awards-top-ten-finalists/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2021/05/2021-locus-awards-top-ten-finalists/&lt;/a&gt;

Even more exciting than making the top ten is the company it puts me in: the other finalists are:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine by Elizabeth Bear &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconquerable Sun by Kate Elliott&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agency by William Gibson &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Relentless Moon by Mary Robinette Kowal &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War of the Maps by Paul McAuley &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Last Emperox by John Scalzi &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Effect by Martha Wells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interlibrary Loan by Gene Wolfe &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

(also excited to see Tor Books, my publisher, next to so many of those names!)

The entire list is, as always, a must-read guide to the best sf/f of the past year. This year's Locus Awards Weekend is a virtual affair (for obvious reasons) and runs Jun 23-26. You can sign up here:

&lt;img alt="'ILGWU Local 62 marches in a Labor Day parade' - A group of Black women and their daughters lead a union march, draped in colorful ponchos and waving US flags." src="https://craphound.com/images/5278801929_c430379eae_b.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The PRO Act and worker misclassification (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/07/pro-act-class-war/#sectoral-balances"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

One of the Biden admin's most important pieces of legislation is the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act), which reverses decades of union-busting policies and laws that have led to widening inequality, wage stagnation, and working poverty across America.

It's the first pro-worker law since 1935's NLRA, and it restores many of the rights to organize unions and create serious penalties for employers who break the law to prevent their workers from unionizing (today, employers break labor laws with impunity).

For a great, plain-language breakdown of its contours, check out this breakdown by Kim Kelly, Teen Vogue's labor reporter. Note that the law bans many of the dirtiest tricks used by Amazon to defeat the union drive in its Bessemer, Alabama warehouse.

&lt;a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-the-pro-act"&gt;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-the-pro-act&lt;/a&gt;

The PRO Act doesn't just restore the labor rights that have been stripped away from American workers - it also creates new protections to address the epidemic of worker misclassification where "gig economy" employees are falsely characterized as "independent contractors."

The gig companies - who use worker misclassification to pay sub-minimum-wage salaries and deny basic workplace protections - spent $200m to pass California's Proposition 22. Immediately, bosses fired their union workers and replaced them with gig workers.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22&lt;/a&gt;

Companies like Uber and Lyft have already showered $1.2m in a matter of weeks on DC politicians, lobbying against the PRO Act. That's not surprising, but what is interesting is their SEC-mandated disclosures about what they expect from the PRO Act:

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/05/06/pro-act-uber-lyft-doordash-instacart-lobbying/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2021/05/06/pro-act-uber-lyft-doordash-instacart-lobbying/&lt;/a&gt;

“If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs." -Uber.

This is a very frank admission of what's at stake here. Corporations understand that the market allows companies to claim an ever-larger share of the proceeds of workers' labor, and that the only way to reverse that lopsided distribution is for workers to organize.

They acknowledge that when workers speak directly to customers about their labor conditions and withhold their labor in the face of unfair practices, corporations suffer - that is, the corporations win when workers are powerless and customers are ignorant.

Passing the PRO Act will not be easy. Establishment Dems like Mark Warner have signalled that they will side with bosses over workers on this bill.

&lt;a href="https://discourseblog.com/mark-warner-pro-act-labor-democrats/"&gt;https://discourseblog.com/mark-warner-pro-act-labor-democrats/&lt;/a&gt;

Warner falsely claims that the bill will take away the right of gig workers &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be unionized. This is just not true, as More Perfect Union reminds us: "This lets independent contractors join a union. It doesn’t force them to."

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1389587206298341382"&gt;https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1389587206298341382&lt;/a&gt;

The entire gig economy runs on idiotic lies like this one. Take the premise that workers are independent, organized into "two-sided markets" by apps that match workers and work, and that manage the process with cool, machine-like objectivity.

As is always the case with disciplinary technology, the gig work app isn't actually in charge - it's just a convenient way for human beings to hide their sadistic behavior behind a scrim of technology theater.

Think of Amazon Delivery Service Partner (DSP) drivers. Amazon maintains the pretense that these workers aren't employees OR contractors - they say that they're SUBcontractors, working for "entrepreneurs" who contract with Amazon to make deliveries.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex&lt;/a&gt;

DSP drivers wear Amazon uniforms and drive vans with the Amazon logo. They are surveilled by multiple interior and exterior cameras that track their location, their driving, and (checks notes) their facial expressions?!

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/some-amazon-drivers-have-had-enough-can-they-unionize/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/some-amazon-drivers-have-had-enough-can-they-unionize/&lt;/a&gt;

Amazon gives its 2,500 DSP owners impossible delivery goals, and the DSP owners pass those on to their 158,000 drivers. This is why drivers have to piss and shit in bags in their trucks, a fact that Amazon denied even though they knew it was true:

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/25/amazon-delivery-workers-bathrooms-memo"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/25/amazon-delivery-workers-bathrooms-memo&lt;/a&gt;

But for all the electronic monitoring and micromanaging that DSP drivers endure, the exploitation they face is anything but automated. When DSP drivers are forced to work in dangerous and inhumane conditions, it's because human beings are imposing that on them.

Remember all those apps that monitor drivers? The DSP owners instruct their drivers to turn them off whenever there's a delivery crunch, and then order drivers to proceed at unsafe speeds on residential streets to make Amazon's quotas:

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgxx54/amazon-drivers-are-instructed-to-drive-recklessly-to-meet-delivery-quotas"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgxx54/amazon-drivers-are-instructed-to-drive-recklessly-to-meet-delivery-quotas&lt;/a&gt;

Workers who refuse to drive unsafely are disciplined and fired (those automated systems ensure that there's always some excuse for firing a worker, and the worker's misclassification as an independent contractor means they have no recourse in the face of unjust dismissals).

Amazon says this is all the work of rogue contractors, and not the result of its impossible quota system.

Worker misclassification lets Amazon have its cake and eat it too - force workers to shit in bags and risk their lives driving too fast, and then claim innocence.

Worker protections start with being recognized as a worker. Ending worker misclassification isn't incidental to the PRO Act, it's at its heart: without it, every worker who stands up for their rights will be reclassified as a contractor and crushed.

&lt;h1&gt;$50k fellowships for critical technologists (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/07/pro-act-class-war/#help-wanted"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In world of morally compromised technology and markets, a few entities stand out as consistently on the side of right. Consumer Reports is one of them.

For 85 years, they have produced rigorous, unbiased, trustworthy accounts of the manufactured goods in our lives.

As good as they are at this, understanding digital technology requires significant changes, as software-based devices (especially those that interact with remote services) are difficult to evaluate in the lab, since their characteristics can be silently altered at any time.

CR rose to this challenge with a series of excellent, in-depth cybersecurity breakdowns of products and services, but it's still early days.

Enter the CR Digital Lab, with nonresidential fellowships "to uncover and address emerging consumer harms."

&lt;a href="https://digital-lab.consumerreports.org/join/"&gt;https://digital-lab.consumerreports.org/join/&lt;/a&gt;

These are paid ($50k!) one-year fellowships " of interest to engineers, computer scientists, information security professionals, independent researchers, academics, social scientists, and others."

Fellows work with CR's reporters and advocates, get access to its lab facilities, and work with its wide-ranging network of public-interest technologists.

You have until May 21 to apply.

&lt;img alt="EFF's Right to Repair logo: a green flag with a crossed hammer and crescent wrench in a centered yellow circle." src="https://craphound.com/images/tinker-tech.png"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The FTC's (kick-ass) Right to Repair report (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/07/pro-act-class-war/#we-fixit"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

It's been nearly two years since the FTC's Nixing the Fix workshop on how corporations have sabotage our right to repair. Finally, the Commission has issued its report, and it's hugely vindicating for R2R advocates.

&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

If you don't have time to read the 56-page report, check out Ifixit's cheat-sheet, which highlights the salient points, namely:

&lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50251/ftc-report-congress-nixing-fix-repair-restrictions-reactions"&gt;https://www.ifixit.com/News/50251/ftc-report-congress-nixing-fix-repair-restrictions-reactions&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies routinely violate federal law by voiding their customers' warranties in retaliation for seeking independent repair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-repair tactics more heavily harm Black people and communities of color&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic made independent repair sabotage even more important&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies sabotage repair by: designing products to make it harder to fix them; withholding parts and manuals; targeting customers with anti-repair FUD; abusing patent and trademark; using DRM; and imposing abusive EULAs on customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission found that the manufacturers claims about why they should monopolize repair are bullshit:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing independent repair info doesn't harm manufacturers' IP rights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data need to make repair doesn't qualify as a trade secret&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission also found that the real safety concern with independent repair is that manufacturers' sabotage makes it harder for indie repairers to fix devices safely, and the answer isn't to ban indie repair - it's to ban sabotage.

The FTC also rejects cybersecurity FUD about independent repair: "the record contains no empirical evidence to suggest that independent repair shops are more or less likely than authorized repair shops to compromise or misuse customer data."

As well as arguments that independent repair inflicts "reputational harm" and liability on manufacturers: "Manufacturers provided no empirical evidence to support their concerns about reputational harm or potential liability resulting from faulty third party repairs."

The FTC wants to hear from you if a manufacturer has voided (or threatened to void) your warranty after you got independent repair. This is illegal.

&lt;a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/"&gt;https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/&lt;/a&gt;

They're also proposing new regulations to ban manufacturers' repair sabotage on the grounds that it represents unfair competition. The Commission's goal is now "[to ensure] consumers have choices when they need to repair products that they purchase and own."

&lt;h1&gt;How the Sacklers rigged the game (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/23/a-bankrupt-process/#sacklers"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Two quotes to ponder as you read "Purdue's Poison Pill," Adam Levitin's forthcoming Texas Law Review paper:

"Some will rob you with a six-gun, And some with a fountain pen." (W. Guthrie)

"Behind every great fortune there is a great crime." (H. Balzac) (paraphrase)

Some background. Purdue was/is the pharmaceutical company that deliberately kickstarted the opioid crisis by deceptive, aggressive marketing of its drug Oxycontin, amassing a fortune so vast that it made its owners, the Sackler family, richer than the Rockefellers.

Many companies are implicated in the opioid crisis, but Purdue played a larger and more singular role in an epidemic that has killed more Americans than the Vietnam war: Purdue, alone among the pharma companies, is almost exclusively devoted to selling opioids.

And Purdue is also uniquely associated with a single family, the Sacklers, whose family dynasty betrays a multigenerational genius for innovating in crime and sleaze.

The founder of the family fortune, Arthur Sackler, invented modern drug marketing with his campaigns for benzos like Valium, kickstarting an addiction crisis that burned for decades and is still with us today.

His kids, while not inventing the art of reputation laundering through elite philanthropy, did more to advance this practice than anyone since the robber barons whose names grace institutions like Carnegie-Mellon University.

The Sackler name became synonymous not with the cynical creation of a mass death drug epidemic and a media strategy that blamed the victims as "criminal addicts" - rather, "Sackler" was associated with museums from the Met to the Louvre.

Handing out crumbs from their vast trove of blood-money was just one half of the Sacklers' reputation-laundering. The other half used a phalanx of vicious attack-lawyers who'd threaten anyone who criticized them in public (I personally got one of these).

The Sacklers could not have attained their high body count nor their vast bank-balances without the help of elite legal enablers, both the specialists from discreet boutique firms and the rank-and-file of the great white-shoe firms.

I'm not one to take cheap shots at lawyers. Lawyers are often superheroes, defending the powerless against the powerful. But the law has a bullying problem, a sadistic cadre of brilliant people who live to crush their opponents.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/10/duke-sucks/#devils"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/10/duke-sucks/#devils&lt;/a&gt;

To see the sadism at work, look no further than the K-shaped world of bankruptcy: for the wealthy, bankruptcy is the sport of kings, a way to skip out on consequences. For the poor, bankruptcy is an anchor - or a noose.

When working people are saddled with debts - even debts they did not themselves amass - they are hounded by petty, vindictive monsters who deluge them with calls and emails and threats.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation&lt;/a&gt;

But it's very different for the wealthy. Community Hospital Systems is one of the largest hospital chains in America, thanks to the $7.6b worth of debt it acquired along with 80+ hospitals, which it is running into the ground.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/18/unhealthy-balance-sheet/#health-usury"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/18/unhealthy-balance-sheet/#health-usury&lt;/a&gt;

CHS raked in hundreds of millions in interest-free forgivable loans, stimulus and other public subsidies and paid out millions from that to its execs for "performance bonuses."

It also leads the industry in suing its indigent patients, some for as little as $201.

Debt and bankruptcy are key to private equity's playbook, especially the most destructive forms of financial engineering, like "club deal" leveraged buyouts that turn productive businesses into bankrupt husks while the PE firms pocket billions:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/14/billionaire-class-solidarity/#club-deals"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/14/billionaire-class-solidarity/#club-deals&lt;/a&gt;

For mere mortals - those of us who can't afford to hire legal enablers to work the system - bankruptcy is a mystery. If you know someone who went bankrupt, chances are they had their lives destroyed. How can bankruptcy be a gift, rather than a curse?

Purdue Pharma presents a maddening case-study in the corrupt benefits of bankruptcy. When it was announced in March, many were outraged to learn that the Sacklers were going to walk away with billions, while their victims got stiffed.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/31/vaccine-for-the-global-south/#claims-extinguished"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/31/vaccine-for-the-global-south/#claims-extinguished&lt;/a&gt;

Levitin's paper uses the Purdue bankruptcy as a jumping-off point to explain how this can be - how corporate bankruptcy "megacases" have become a sham that subverts the very purpose of bankruptcy: to allow orderly payments to creditors while preserving good businesses.

Levitin identifies three pathologies corrupting the US bankruptcy system.

First is "coercive restructuring techniques" that allow debtors and senior creditors to tie bankruptcy judges' hands and those of other creditors, overriding bankruptcy law itself.

These techniques - "DIP financing agreements," "Stalking Horse bidder protections," "Hurry-up agreements," etc - are esoteric, though Levitin does a good job of explaining each.

More significant than their underlying rules is their &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt;.

That effect? Thousands of Oxy survivors and families of Oxycontin victims lost their right to sue the Sacklers and Purdue pharma because of these techniques. In return, the Sacklers surrendered about a third of the billions they reaped.

&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purduepharma-bankruptcy/sacklers-reaped-up-to-13-billion-from-oxycontin-maker-u-s-states-say-idUSKBN1WJ19V"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purduepharma-bankruptcy/sacklers-reaped-up-to-13-billion-from-oxycontin-maker-u-s-states-say-idUSKBN1WJ19V&lt;/a&gt;

Depriving the victims of the Sacklers' drug empire of the right to sue doesn't just leave the Sacklers with billions; it also means that no official record will be produced detailing the Sacklers' complicity in hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Levitin: "The single most important question in the most socially important chapter 11 case in history will be determined through a process that does not comport with basic notions of due process."

The Sacklers are not unique beneficiaries of "coercive restructuring techniques." The rise of "prepack" and 24-hour "drive through" bankruptcies have turned judges into rubberstampers of private agreements between debtors and their cronies, with no look-in for victims.

It in these proceedings that the law descends into self-parody, more Marx Brothers than casebook. Levitin highlights the Feb '21 "drive-through" bankruptcy of Belk Department Stores, where the judge was told that failing to accede to the private deal would risk 17,000 jobs.

The trustees representing Belk's non-crony creditors were railroaded through this "agreement," upon notice consisting of an "unintelligible" one-page, one-paragraph release opening with "a 630-word sentence with 92commas and five parentheticals."

Sackler lawyers were geniuses at this game, securing judicial approval of a deal where the Sacklers' personal liability to the Feds went from $4.5b to $225m. The judge heard no evidence about whether the Sacklers' voluntary payout was even close to their liabilities.

The corruption of bankruptcy is bad enough, as the creditors for finance criminals are often small firms and workers' pension.

The Sacklers' case is far worse: they don't owe billions in unpaid loans - they owe criminal and civil liability for the lives they destroyed.

The next area of corruption that Levitin takes up is the inadequacy of the appeals process for bankruptcy settlements. This, too, is complex, but it has a simple outcome: once a judge agrees to a settlement, it's virtually impossible to appeal it.

In those rare instances where people do win appeals, they are still denied justice, because the appellate courts typically find that it's too late to remedy the lower courts' decisions.

That makes the business of "coercive restructuring techniques" (in which judges rubber-stamp corrupt arrangements between debtors and their cronies) even more important, since any ruling from a bankruptcy judge is apt to be final.

The third and most important corrupt element of elite bankruptcy that Levitin describes is the ability for debtors' lawyers to pick which judge will rule on their case, a phenomena that means that only &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; judges hear &lt;em&gt;nearly every&lt;/em&gt; major bankruptcy case in America.

"[In 2020] 39% of large public company bankruptcy filings ended up before Judge David Jones in Houston. 57% of the large company cases ended up before either Jones or two other judges, Marvin Isgur in Houston and Robert Drain in White Plains."

&lt;a href="https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2021/05/judge-shopping-in-bankruptcy.html"&gt;https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2021/05/judge-shopping-in-bankruptcy.html&lt;/a&gt;

In other words, elite law firms have figured out how to "hack" the bankruptcy process so they can choose from among three judges. And these three judges weren't picked at random - rather, they competed to bring these "megacases" to their courts.

This competition is visible in how these judges rule - in ways that are favorable to cronyistic arrangements between debtors and their favored, deep-pocketed creditors - and in the public statements the judges themselves have made, going on the record admitting it.

Levitin cites the groundbreaking work of Harvard/UCLA law prof Lynn LoPucki on why judges want to dominate bankruptcy megacases. LoPucki points out hearing these cases definitely increases "post-judicial employment opportunities" - but says the true motives are more complex.

Levitin, summarizing LoPucki: "[it's more] in the nature of personal aggrandizement and celebrity and ability to indirectly channel to the local bankruptcy bar.. The judge is the star and the ringmaster of a megacase - very appealing to certain personalities"

Obviously, not every judge wants these things, but the ones that do are of a type - "willing and eager to cater to debtors to attract business...[an] assurance to debtors that...these  judges will not transfer out cases with improper venue or rule against the debtor..."

Forum-shopping in bankruptcy is not new, but it has accelerated and mutated.

Once, the game was to transfer cases to Delaware and the Southern District of New York.

It's why the LA Dodgers went bankrupt in Delaware, why Detroit's iconic General Motors and Texas's own Enron got their cases heard in the SDNY.

The bankruptcy courts have long been in on this game, allowing the flimsiest of pretences to locate a case in a favorable venue.

For example, GM argued that it was a New York company on the basis that it owned a single Chevy dealership in Harlem.

Other companies simple open an office in a preferred jurisdiction for a few months before filing for bankruptcy there.

Lately, the venue of choice for dirty bankruptcies is in Texas (if only Enron could have held on for a couple more decades!). Only two Houston judges hear bankruptcy cases, and any bankruptcy lawyer who gets on their bad side risks ending their career.

Once a court becomes a national center for complex bankruptcies, the bankruptcy bar works to ensure that only favorable judges hear cases there, punishing a district by seeking other venues when a judge goes "rogue." The fix is in from the start.

Purdue did not want to have its case heard in Texas. Instead, it manipulated the system so that it could argue in front of SDNY Judge Robert D Drain.

It was a good call, as Drain is notoriously generous with granting "third-party releases," which would allow the Sacklers to escape their debts to the victims and survivors of their Oxy-pushing.

Once Drain agreed to the restructuring, he ensured that the victims would never get their day in court, and no evidence - from medical examiners, auditors, and medical professionals who received kickbacks for every patient they addicted - would be entered into the record.

Drain is also notoriously hostile to independent examiners, "an independent third-party appointed by the court to investigate 'fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity...by  current or former management of the debtor."

But getting the case in front of Drain took some heroic maneuvering by the Sacklers' lawyers. Levitin tracks each step of a Byzantine plan that somehow allowed a company that gave its address in Connecticut to have its case heard in New York.

The key to getting in front of Judge Drain appears to involve literally hacking the system, by putting a Westchester County location in the machine-readable metadata for its filing in the federal Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) system.

CM/ECF does not parse the text of the PDF that it receives from lawyers; only the metadata is parsed. The company listed a White Plains, NY address in this metadata, even though it had never conducted business there.

Purdue seems to have opened this office 192 days earlier for the sole purpose of getting its bankruptcy in front of Judge Drain (they were eligible for Westchester County jurisdiction 180 days after opening the office).

Their lawyers even went so far as to pre-caption the case filing with "RDD" - for "Robert D Drain" - knowing that all complex bankruptcies in Westchester County were Drain's to hear.

The fact that the Sacklers were able to choose their judge - a judge who was notorious for his policies that abetted elite impunity in bankruptcy - is nakedly corrupt.

This move is how the Sacklers are walking away from corporate mass murder with a giant fortune. The art galleries have started to remove their names from their buildings, but they'll have a lot of money to keep themselves warm even if they're shunned in polite society.

A couple weeks ago, a Texas judge ruled against the NRA, denying its bankruptcy, on the grounds that it was a flimsy pretence designed to escape liability in New York, where it was incorporated.

&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nra-bankruptcy-dismissed-a281b888b64d391374f24539a820d60f"&gt;https://apnews.com/article/nra-bankruptcy-dismissed-a281b888b64d391374f24539a820d60f&lt;/a&gt;

For many of us, the NRA bankruptcy was a kind of puzzle. We went from glad that the NRA was bankrupt to glad that they WEREN'T, because for dark money orgs like the NRA, bankruptcy isn't a punishment, it's a way to escape justice.

The NRA case is evidence that the corruption of the bankruptcy system isn't yet complete. That's no reason to assume everything is fine. The Sacklers are developing a playbook that will be used to escape other elite crimes with vast fortunes intact.

&lt;img alt="The cover of the new edition of Prisoners' Inventions, featuring a white-on-black list of the inventions contained therein." src="https://craphound.com/images/PI_Web1__85342.1609993302.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Prisoners' Inventions (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/09/king-rat/#mother-of-invention"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

2003's PRISONERS INVENTIONS is an underground classic, a high-stakes precursor to MAKE Magazine, combining ingenuity, adversarial interoperability, and user-centered design. After 13 years out of print, Half Letter Press published a new, expanded edition.

&lt;a href="https://halfletterpress.com/prisoners-inventions-new-edition/"&gt;https://halfletterpress.com/prisoners-inventions-new-edition/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="Spread from 2020 edition of Prisoners' Inventions, depicting three different ways of arranging a prison bunk as a drafting environment." src="https://craphound.com/images/PI_web3__64213.1609993130.jpg"/&gt;

Prisoners' Inventions was created by Angelo, a pseudonymous, long-serving incarcerated American who entered into a collaboration with the Temporary Services collective, who both published Angelo's work and staged multiple gallery showings of his work.

&lt;img alt="Floorplan of a prison cell." src="https://craphound.com/images/cell_drawing_1_press.jpg"/&gt;

For these shows, museum workers followed Angelo's finely drafted, detailed drawings and notes to recreate the inventions he'd documented, recreating his cell from the floorplans and elevations he'd supplied.

&lt;img alt="A museum reproduction of Angelo's cell, produced from his floorplans." src="https://craphound.com/images/PI_Three_Dialogues.pdf.jpg"/&gt;

The new edition documents these showings, and the absurd ways that Angelo experienced them - for example, when a guard discovered a postcard with a recreation of Angelo's cell, he was convinced that this was evidence that someone had smuggled a digital camera into the prison.

So realistic was the reproduction - so precise and faithful were Angelo's plans - that the warden took extensive persuading to be convinced that the digital camera theory was a paranoid guard's fantasy.

&lt;img alt="Prison coat-hanger" src="https://craphound.com/images/coat_hanger.jpg"/&gt;

The anaecdote illustrates the core attraction of PRISONERS' INVENTIONS: not just that Angelo has a fine, expressive draftsman's hand, nor that his accompanying text makes for an economical, shrewdly observed ethnography of the tools and their users.

&lt;img alt="Spread from 2020 edition of Prisoners' Inventions, depicting a suite of dining-related inventions and an 'Extra Finger' invention that holds down the hot-water actuator in a cell's sink." src="https://craphound.com/images/PI_Web8__48909.1610202149.jpg"/&gt;

But rather that this ingenuity is an act of survival and resistance, created under harsh conditions where each inventor must create the tools to fashion the tools - under adversarial conditions where all-powerful enemies can smash everything and set the makers back to zero.

&lt;img alt="D-Cell battery cigarette lighter" src="https://craphound.com/images/battery_cig_lighter_press.jpg"/&gt;

In some regards, it's like a for-real version of those neo-neolithic Youtubers who show how to bootstrap advanced tooling from raw materials. In others, it's a physical version of the beloved first-person accounts of daring feats recounted in the pages of 2600.

&lt;img alt="Spread from 2020 edition of Prisoners' Inventions, depicting a property locker grill and a toilet-paper cooking 'bomb.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/PI_Web5__72237.1609993133.jpg"/&gt;

This is true adversarial interoperability - treating the environment as a puzzle and a challenge, to be deconstructed and reconfigured by toolsmiths for their users' benefit, overcoming both user-hostile designs and policing by the original designers' armed enforcers.

&lt;img alt="Prison cigarette lighter made from a modified hotpot" src="https://craphound.com/images/unnamed.jpg"/&gt;

Reading Angelo's accounts of his fellow toolsmiths' ingenuity, I was forcibly reminded of the thrill and dread I experience every time I re-read James Clavell's debut novel, KING RAT, a fictionalized account of his incarceration in the infamous Changi death-camp.

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Rat_%28Clavell_novel%29"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Rat_%28Clavell_novel%29&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="Spread from 2020 edition of Prisoners' Inventions, depicting two variations on the 'stinger' immersion heater." src="https://craphound.com/images/PI_Web4__62001.1609993136.jpg"/&gt;

I always lingered over Clavell's description of the POWs' ingenuity, from the contraband radio inside hidden water-bottle compartments that had to be clipped together when the conspirators gathered to tune into war news, or how tailors practiced their trade behind the wire.

&lt;img alt="The original cover of Abbie Hoffman's STEAL THIS BOOK." src="https://craphound.com/images/71rq5se0pgL.jpg"/&gt;

This is the true hacker mindset, the combination of playfulness, lateral thinking, user-centered design, and pitting your wits against brutal authority. It's part of a lineage that includes classics like STEAL THIS BOOK.

&lt;a href="http://mindcontrol-research.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/32_IV_HoffmanAbbie_StealThisBook_NewYork_PirateEditionsGrovePress_1971.pdf"&gt;http://mindcontrol-research.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/32_IV_HoffmanAbbie_StealThisBook_NewYork_PirateEditionsGrovePress_1971.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="Tire-sandal illustration from Steal This Book." src="https://craphound.com/images/32_IV_HoffmanAbbie_StealThisBook_NewYork_PirateEditionsGrovePress_1971.pdf.jpg"/&gt;

The illustrations in Steal This Book are strikingly similar to those in Prisoners' Inventions, though Angelo's prose is sharper and less self-indulgent.

&lt;img alt="A page from MEND AND MAKE DO describing how to make an apron from a worn-out men's shirt." src="https://craphound.com/images/61e20fd08b0f12890627ce6e30aa9afc.jpg"/&gt;

Equally, Prisoners' Inventions recalls wartime pamphlets like the famous MEND AND MAKE DO, with their emphasis on thrift and finding creature comforts under conditions of indefinite hardship and privation.

&lt;a href="https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106365.html"&gt;https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106365.html&lt;/a&gt;

Many of the inventions Angelo catalogues are about creating space for comfort out of miserable conditions. The prisoners who make greeting-card pigments by scraping ink off magazine ads and mixing it with body-lotion embrace the Mend and Make Do ethos as much as anyone.

&lt;img alt="The cover of Gustavo Alvarez's 'Prison Ramen.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/406bf26dc42b4664e170910359764a97.jpg"/&gt;

Prisoners' Inventions deserves a spot on your shelf between your MAKE Magazines and your copy of PRISON RAMEN, a bridge between those two world.

&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37164279"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37164279&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="The cover of 'Concentration Camp Dachau, 1933-1945.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/91t8pJmVeiL.jpg"/&gt;

I long treasured my 2003 copy of the original. Last year, my office flooded and I lost my whole bottom shelf of books. I salvaged just two: that 2003 edition and the illustrated history of Dachau my parents gave me when we visited the camp when I was 12.

Both books recorded prisoners' resistance, the humanity of caged people in inhumane circumstances - and both do so from the perspective of the incarcerated, just as King Rat does. These are powerful stories that shaped my view of the world and are never far from my mind.

As the new edition's introduction notes, Angelo died in Dec 2016 in LA, three years after his release from more than two decades of incarceration. He was days away from his 73rd birthday.

&lt;a href="https://us6.campaign-archive.com/?u=b8471866234ee0d53940f266d&amp;amp;amp;id=ec274824dd&amp;amp;amp;e=7d41a18bd2"&gt;https://us6.campaign-archive.com/?u=b8471866234ee0d53940f266d&amp;amp;amp;id=ec274824dd&amp;amp;amp;e=7d41a18bd2&lt;/a&gt;

He spent his brief years of freedom watching and cataloging films he sourced from thrift stores and other secondary sources, living a quiet and mostly solitary life.

The new edition is a tribute to Angelo. America continues to incarcerate more people than any nation in human history.

&lt;a name="interop"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="EFF's interoperability banner graphic, a kind of Rube Goldberg machine integrating pulleys, belts, megaphones, emoticons, lightbulbs, HTML tags, a Creative Commons icon, a radio tower, a padlock, etc." src="https://craphound.com/images/interoperable_plum.png"/&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The ACCESS Act (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/12/access-act/#interop"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Five Big Tech antitrust bills were introduced in the House Judiciary Committee today; they're the most significant antitrust effort in more than half a century, and they cover a lot of ground.

&lt;a href="https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/house-lawmakers-release-anti-monopoly-agenda-stronger-online-economy-opportunity"&gt;https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/house-lawmakers-release-anti-monopoly-agenda-stronger-online-economy-opportunity&lt;/a&gt;

There's a bill to ban "self-preferencing" (when a company-run marketplace pushes its inferior products over its rivals' superior ones); another to block anticompetitive acquisitions; a bill to block "walled gardens"; and a bill to fund the FTC to police all this stuff.

But I'm most excited about is the ACCESS Act, a bill to force interoperability on the biggest tech platforms, the kinds of services people use because they have to, because their friends or communities or customers (or media) are locked into them.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/access-act-takes-step-towards-more-interoperable-future"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/access-act-takes-step-towards-more-interoperable-future&lt;/a&gt;

Under the ACCESS Act, very large companies will be required to offer an API that allows users to take their data to a rival service, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; let them continue to talk to the people they left behind when they quit Big Tech.

It's designed to put an end to the Roach Motel business model, where your data checks in, but never checks out.

Now, interop is a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; remedy for tech monopolies, but it comes with risks: first, that new platforms could abuse the data users bring with them, and second, that the API itself could be abused to steal data.

The ACCESS Act requires good security practices for the API and the services that connect to it, and it has a "circuit-breaker" cause allowing big platforms to temporarily shut off the API if someone figures out how to exploit it (and penalties for pretextual use of this).

And it has good - but not perfect - language protecting user privacy. The new services that take advantage of these new data flows are bound by rules prohibiting them from exploiting it or making money from it - and the law provides for &lt;em&gt;stonking&lt;/em&gt; fines for rulebreakers.

Sure, "a fine is a price," but this is a steep price: the &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; of 15% of total global revenue (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; profit) or 30% of US revenues.

To get a sense of how privacy and interop can help each other check out today's techno-legal analysis from EFF:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/gdpr-privacy-and-monopoly"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/gdpr-privacy-and-monopoly&lt;/a&gt;

Despite that, there's an important omission from this bill: a private right of action.

Laws with private rights of action can be enforced by the public - that is, if a company hurts you, you can sue (or join a class action, or seek help from a public interest lawfirm).

Without that private right of action, you have to hope that someone at the FTC, or an attorney general, or some other federal law enforcement entity decides to stick up for your rights.

Without a private right of action, the ACCESS Act depends on well-funded, motivated federal agencies.

The problem, of course, is that the GOP doesn't like private rights of action; they see them as "anti-business," and an invitation to "nuisance suits."

That matters because there's actually a chance that Republicans will support these. After decades of cheerleading for monopolies, the GOP was horrified to discover that the whole digital world is controlled by massive companies with weird, capricious moderation policies.

Once those policies were turned on them - after years of use against Palestinians, trans people, sex workers, BLM activists, Water Protectors, etc - Republicans stopped asserting the absolute right of businesses to set their own policies.

Most of the GOP policy responses to this are, frankly, really stupid, from state laws prohibiting platforms from terminating politicians' accounts to "common carrier" (no deleting porn!) and "fairness doctrine" (every astronomer has to debate an astrologist).

Far better than trying to turn the massive, unweildy monopolists into &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; monopolists is to &lt;em&gt;end monopolies&lt;/em&gt;, creating a federated online world where users can choose the speech norms they're comfortable with and connect to users on other services.

That's not just a better policy, it's a better &lt;em&gt;Republican&lt;/em&gt; policy. If you think it's a free speech violation to force a bakery to make a gay wedding cake, how the hell can you think it's OK to force a platform to carry your speech?

Which is to say, there's potential bipartisan support for these bills, and to secure it, the bills' sponsors are willing to set aside a private right of action.

I happen to think it's not a good trade-off, and I plan to campaign for these bills to pass - &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they're amended to add a private right of action.

Despite the compromises, these are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good bills, the biggest thing to happen to antitrust in generations.

&lt;h1&gt;Charter schools are money laundries (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/26/aggregate-demand/#ed-bezzle"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Critiques of charter schools usually focus on poor quality education (disproportionately affecting racialized and poor people) and dangerous ideology (the movement is funded by billionaire dilettantes and religious maniacs), and with good reason!

&lt;img alt="Scans from textbooks from Abeka, BJU Press and Accelerated Christian Education (ACE), used in charter schools nationwide." src="https://craphound.com/images/os-1527792406-r610gq03s0-snap-image-1.jpg"/&gt;

Charters hand public funds to private institutions with minimal oversight. Public money should not go to schools that endorse slavery and indigenous genocide, nor schools that deny evolution and claim humans and dinosaurs co-existed.

&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180604002542/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/school-zone/os-voucher-school-curriculum-20180503-story.html"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180604002542/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/school-zone/os-voucher-school-curriculum-20180503-story.html&lt;/a&gt;

Charter students know they're getting substandard educations - that's why the 2019 valedictorians for  Detroit’s Universal Academy used their speech to denounce the school, its curriculum and administrators.

&lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2019/06/10/salutatorians-criticize-charter-school-graduation/1381474001/"&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2019/06/10/salutatorians-criticize-charter-school-graduation/1381474001/&lt;/a&gt;

The more we learn about charters, the worse the situation gets. Take New Orleans, where, post-Katrina, the Republican statehouse and wealthy dilettante "philanthropists" eliminated all public education in favor of charter schools.

&lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/education/article_0c5918cc-058d-11ea-aa21-d78ab966b579.html"&gt;https://www.nola.com/news/education/article_0c5918cc-058d-11ea-aa21-d78ab966b579.html&lt;/a&gt;

A decade later, the state education regulator gave half these schools "D" or "F" grades.

No wonder that charter teachers joined LA public school teachers on their Red For Ed pickets in 2019:

&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-edu-lausd-strike-accelerated-school-20190114-story.html"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-edu-lausd-strike-accelerated-school-20190114-story.html&lt;/a&gt;

Charter schools pitch themselves as grassroots phenomena, made possible thanks to the passion of parents seeking quality educations for their kids. The reality is that the movement is funded and promoted through a corrupt network of ultra-wealthy ideologues.

The Kochs and the Waltons (Walmart) have secretly funneled vast fortunes into disinformation campaigns aimed at demonizing teachers' unions:

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/12/teacher-strikes-rightwing-secret-strategy-revealed"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/12/teacher-strikes-rightwing-secret-strategy-revealed&lt;/a&gt;

They were joined by the likes of Trump education secretary Betsy DeVos, a fundamentalist who makes no secret of her view that charters can remove the barrier between church and state and institute publicly funded Christian indoctrination in schools:

&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/politics/eli-broad-letter-betsy-devos/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/politics/eli-broad-letter-betsy-devos/index.html&lt;/a&gt;

Destroying public education is the sport of kings. Bill Gates blew $775m on a failed charter experiment whose subjects were children who got no say in the matter:

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-06-27/here-s-how-not-to-improve-public-schools"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-06-27/here-s-how-not-to-improve-public-schools&lt;/a&gt;

Gates has solid teammates in his anti-public-education crusade. I mean, who can say no to Mark Zuckerberg?

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/technology/silicon-valley-kansas-schools.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/technology/silicon-valley-kansas-schools.html&lt;/a&gt;

Misery &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; company, which is why the Sacklers - mass-murdering architects of the opioid epidemic - sunk so much blood money into the charter project (incredibly, this "philanthropy" is supposed to &lt;em&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt; their reputation):

&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171113043810/https://www.alternet.org/education/notorious-family-contributing-opioid-crisis-and-funding-charter-schools/"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171113043810/https://www.alternet.org/education/notorious-family-contributing-opioid-crisis-and-funding-charter-schools/&lt;/a&gt;

But a critique of charters that starts with poor outcomes and ends with ideological billionaires misses the third leg of this stool: money-laundering and financial fraud.

Admittedly some of that has been in plain sight for years. Remember when an LA school board exec plead guilty to felony finance fraud and conspiracy for his role in the charter-backed takeover of the board?

&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-edu-ref-rodriguez-resigns-20180722-story.html#"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-edu-ref-rodriguez-resigns-20180722-story.html#&lt;/a&gt;

But "Chartered For Profit," a report from Network for Public Education is by far the most comprehensive look at the means by which billions are transferred from public school districts to profiteers, at the expense of kids in both the charter and public system.

&lt;a href="https://networkforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chartered-for-Profit.pdf"&gt;https://networkforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chartered-for-Profit.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

In an interview with Jacobin's Meagan Day, NPE's  executive director Carol Burris discusses the blockbuster report, which is so damning that it prompted a bill in Congress that bans funding to charters that are managed by for-profit contractors.

&lt;a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/07/charter-schools-for-profit-nonprofit-taxpayer-public-money-oversight-education-salaries-real-estate-burris-interview"&gt;https://jacobinmag.com/2021/07/charter-schools-for-profit-nonprofit-taxpayer-public-money-oversight-education-salaries-real-estate-burris-interview&lt;/a&gt;

Burris explains that even though nearly all charters are nonprofits (except in AZ), there's a widespread practice of contracting with for-profit corporations to "manage" these schools; the for-profits are often owned by the schools founders or their relatives.

Others are nationwide chains that offer comprehensive management services - "comprehensive" in the sense of steering schools to procure materials, services and supplies from affiliates that overcharge and kick-back to the management companies.

From substandard, overpriced cafeteria fare; to janky, nonfunctional ed-tech; to unqualified, underpaid teachers, these for-profit entities figure out how to minimize costs, maximize profits, and disguise poor student outcomes so they can keep doing it.

They deploy opaque corporate structures to give the appearance of a thriving ecosystem of suppliers - meanwhile, the largest chain, Academica, consists of 56 companies at one address, more than 70 at another, and a network of real-estate, holding and finance companies.

Real estate plays a major role in charter profiteering. Profiteers scoop up tax-advantaged funding and subsidized loans to buy buildings, leased at inflated rates to charters, with the tax-payer paying their mortgage.

When the mortgage is paid, more tax dollars are used to buy the school at inflated prices.

But it's even more profitable to run a "virtual school" where you can deliver canned lectures and fake attendance records and pocket vast sums in public money.

For-profits are also loan-sharks. They offer credit to the nonprofit charters so they can afford the inflated prices for educational "services," charging high interest rates that ensure they get an additional rake off of every public dollar the charter receives.

NPE's "Another Day Another Charter Scandal" page is a good look at the tip of the corruption iceberg - the crimes that get caught, from fake invoices to outright embezzlement. Charter execs use the school's credit card to pay for fancy dinners even trips to Disney World.

&lt;a href="https://networkforpubliceducation.org/another-day-another-charter-scandal/"&gt;https://networkforpubliceducation.org/another-day-another-charter-scandal/&lt;/a&gt;

Charters shouldn't exist, period. But if they must exist, then the loophole that allows for-profits to run the notionally nonprofit charter sector must be closed.

Meanwhile, if you want a look at education "reform" that &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;, check out Andrea Gabor's 2018 "After the Education Wars," and learn how eliminating hierarchy, funding the arts, offering good wages and good training to teachers transform schools.

&lt;a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/millionaire-driven-education-reform-has-failed-heres-what-works"&gt;https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/millionaire-driven-education-reform-has-failed-heres-what-works&lt;/a&gt;

The formula is rather simple, really: "a respect for democratic processes and participatory improvement, a high regard for teachers, clear strategies with buy-in from all stake-holders, and accountability frameworks that include room to innovate."

"Robust leadership and strong teacher voice. Their success underscores the importance of equitable funding and suggests that problems like income inequality are far more detrimental to education that the usual suspects, like bad teachers."

&lt;a name="why-are-we-waiting"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="A group photo from 2008's 'Bat's Day in the Fun Park,' featuring a vast crowd of goths in front of the Disneyland castle." src="https://craphound.com/images/disneyqueue.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Disney parks and aggregate demand management (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/26/aggregate-demand/#why-are-we-waiting"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Three weeks ago, I kicked off a new series of weekly essays in my Medium column, the start of a long series on what we can learn about aggregate demand management and scarcity from the history of queues at Disney theme parks.

The combination of the pandemic and the climate emergency have entered an era of supply shocks and shortages. The pandemic-related snags will eventually stabilize (for certain values of "eventually") but the climate-driven problems will only get worse.

Theme parks may seem like an odd lens to look at scarcity, demand, rationing and expectations through, but I think they're a surprisingly reliable microcosm for understanding these issues.

In part, that's because of their seeming triviality - as with science fiction and other pop culture, theme parks have served as incubators for weird ideas that might have been shot down in higher-stakes environments.

And, as with sf and other pop culture, theme parks are anything but trivial: the desire to be immersed in a fantastic narrative is as old as the first story told before the first fire, and immersive built environments have a storied history - from palaces to escape rooms.

Part I is "Are We Having Fun Yet?" and it traces the true origins of Disneyland - not just the official tale of Walt Disney's search for a place where parents and kids can play together - but also a place where Walt could escape his own company.

&lt;a href="https://gen.medium.com/b-are-we-having-fun-yet-part-i-4c7ef0ce9ee5"&gt;https://gen.medium.com/b-are-we-having-fun-yet-part-i-4c7ef0ce9ee5&lt;/a&gt;

Part II, "Boredom and its discontents," looks at the history of ticketing strategies for Disneyland, drawing - among other things - on a rare original Disneyland prospectus that I posted online after Glenn Beck bought the only copy and locked it up.

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/boredom-and-its-discontents-part-ii-95b10f8d6041"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/boredom-and-its-discontents-part-ii-95b10f8d6041&lt;/a&gt;

Part III is "Now you’ve got two problems." It looks at the psychological impact of different demand-management strategies - the problems that cropped up when Disney management "solved" its earlier issues with all-you-can-eat, single-price admissions.

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/now-youve-got-two-problems-part-iii-45e1328c5ae1"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/now-youve-got-two-problems-part-iii-45e1328c5ae1&lt;/a&gt;

I've just come back from a week in Walt Disney World, celebrating my 50th birthday. It was fascinating to spend a week in the park at this moment, when crowds are surging and management has removed its Fastpass systems. Next week's installment will dig into this.

Future installments will look at the problems with adding more capacity - building more rides draws bigger crowds, and lines get longer, not shorter - and the tension between profit, service delivery, and competition.

I'll also be discussing some of the paternalistic techniques Disney uses to manage its queues - like falsifying the expected wait-times as a means of discouraging people from joining lines - and what democratic alternatives for the "real world" might look like.

&lt;a name="murder-offsets"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="An altered cover of Ayn Rand's 'Atlas Shrugged.' Atlas has been replaced by Monopoly's Rich Uncle Pennybags, his face a skull-mask, dancing a jig. He is golden-colored. The rising sun has been replaced by a rising Earth, wreathed in flames." src="https://craphound.com/images/esgfraud.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Oregon's carbon offsets go up in smoke (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/26/aggregate-demand/#murder-offsets"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The theory behind carbon offsets is that markets created the climate emergency, so markets will solve it. It's a kind of high-stakes denialism, like a lifelong smoker switching to "light" cigarettes after learning they have stage four lung-cancer.

The climate emergency owes its existence to market doctrine: that firms should manage their affairs to maximize shareholder value, irrespective of the costs that maximization imposes on everyone else.

By that logic, all corporate crime is the result of "poor incentives" - maimed workers, ruined neighborhoods and toxic spills are the results of underpriced insurance, or fines that are set too low.

Rather than criminalizing the conduct that leads to these outcomes - shutting down companies that engage in the conduct, holding managers and shareholders personally liable for it - market doctrine insists that we should "rebalance the incentives."

Enter carbon offsets: rather than prohibiting the pollution that will render our planet permanently uninhabitable by our species, we make that pollution economically disfavorable, by offering bribes to companies that promise not to pollute.

Buy a forest, promise not to cut it down, get a tradeable credit. If the credits pay more than clearcutting, the incentives net out in favor of not committing genocide. As the Climate Ad Project puts it, this amounts to a "murder offset."

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/14/for-sale-green-indulgences/#killer-analogy"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/14/for-sale-green-indulgences/#killer-analogy&lt;/a&gt;

From the start, offsets raised an obvious question: how do you know that someone who pledges not to pollute was planning to pollute? How do you keep the system from turning into a market for lemons? Here's a 2010 article raising those questions:

&lt;a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2010/0420/Buying-carbon-offsets-may-ease-eco-guilt-but-not-global-warming"&gt;https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2010/0420/Buying-carbon-offsets-may-ease-eco-guilt-but-not-global-warming&lt;/a&gt;

Fast forward a decade. The answers to the questions remain elusive, but the market for lemons is in full swing. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) funds are full of absolute garbage, stuff that doesn't even pass the giggle-test:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/24/greenwashing/#bargaining"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/24/greenwashing/#bargaining&lt;/a&gt;

Offsets are the worst. Corrupt "charities" like Nature Conservancy make vast fortunes ($932m in 2019) helping the world's worst polluters greenwash their fortunes by offering offsets for set-asides on lands that would never be logged anyway.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#greenwashing"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#greenwashing&lt;/a&gt;

The Conservancy has a history of boasting about its role in burnishing the credentials of sociopaths who want to watch the world burn:

"The only problem with tainted money is there tain't enough of it" -Patrick Noonan, Conservancy President, 1973-80

Despite that, carbon offsets remain credible, but perhaps that'll change. After all, Oregon's 400,000-acre (and counting) Bootleg Fire is consuming vast of carbon offset forests, releasing the carbon the public paid logging companies not to release.

&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/weather/bootleg-oregon-fire-carbon-offsets/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/weather/bootleg-oregon-fire-carbon-offsets/index.html&lt;/a&gt;

Once that public money was in private hands, it returned to public officials - regulators who oversee Oregon's forests, who "sought to discredit climate scientists and operated as a de facto lobbying and public relations arm for the timber industry"

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tax-funded-forest-institute-in-oregon-misled-public-may-have-broken-state-law-audit-finds"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/tax-funded-forest-institute-in-oregon-misled-public-may-have-broken-state-law-audit-finds&lt;/a&gt;

Offsets don't just fail to mitigate the climate emergency - they have a business model: funneling lots of public money to rich people, like the millionaire residents of a gated Pennsylvania estate who got huge tax breaks for their private park.

&lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/inq2/pennsylvania-main-line-estate-tax-breaks-20210716.html"&gt;https://www.inquirer.com/business/inq2/pennsylvania-main-line-estate-tax-breaks-20210716.html&lt;/a&gt;

Everything we do to fix offsets just makes them worse: adding complexity to a loophole-riddled system creates more loopholes. We can't save the world and our species with improved murder offsets.

&lt;h1&gt;Surge pricing violates antitrust law (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/26/aggregate-demand/#pure-transfer"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

If you've paid any attention to the resurgent debate over antitrust, you've likely met the "consumer welfare standard," which is the cornerstone of post-Reagan monopoly law, and which is widely (and correctly) blamed for our new gilded age of vast, unaccountable monopolies.

In the years between the New Deal and the Reagan revolution, the cornerstone of antitrust enforcement was the idea that monopolies are just bad - bad for a clean political process free from excessive corporate corruption.

The watchword of this kind of antitrust is "harmful dominance" - the idea that monopolies hurt workers, suppliers, bystanders, customers, and the legitimacy of the democratic system itself.

Reagan jettisoned those notions, heeding the cries of the Nixonite criminal Robert Bork and his colleagues from the Chicago School of economics, who claimed that "harmful dominance" was too subjective and gave rise to unpredictable enforcement.

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/05/cory-doctorow-qualia/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2021/05/cory-doctorow-qualia/&lt;/a&gt;

"Consumer welfare" was supposed to replace the squishy, qualitative world of "harmful dominance" with an empirical, quantitative standard for when monopolies would face justice. That standard? Higher prices.

Consumers are better off when they pay less and get more. One thing monopolies can do is drive up prices and prices are things we can measure. If a merger is likely create high prices, we can block it. If a conglomerate raises prices, we can punish it.

In practice, this is a nothingburger. Proving consumer welfare harms requires the creation and interpretation of complex mathematical models, and the highest bidder can always hire the most convincing mathematicians to prove that price rises can't be attributed to monopolies.

Consumer welfare advocates - cheerleaders for monopolies - object to this. They say that the monopolies they provide cover for are incredibly efficient, and that's why the FTC and DOJ antitrust enforcers never have cause to go after them.

These monopoly-stans insist that they don't like to see consumers ripped off, and if they ever saw a rip-off that could be definitively attributed to market power, they'd fight it like Teddy Roosevelt going after Standard Oil.

That's not how it works in practice. "The Efficient Queue and the Case Against Dynamic Pricing," a 2020 paper in the Iowa Law Review by U KY law/econ scholar Ramsi A Woodcock documents a widespread consumer welfare harm that's hiding in plain sight.

&lt;a href="https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/author/ramsi-a-woodcock"&gt;https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/author/ramsi-a-woodcock&lt;/a&gt;

That harm? Surge pricing.

Woodcock argues that surge pricing is a pure transfer from consumers to producers - that is, a way to use market power to raise prices without any consumer benefit. He says we should ban it.

Woodcock's paper starts with the fact that shortages occur. The demand for a hot Christmas toy, or a spring break plane ticket, or a seat at Hamilton, or a ride on Space Mountain outstrips the supply. When that happens, some people aren't going to get what they want.

Merchants have two main tactics for deciding whom to disappoint: They can run an auction (surge pricing), or they can establish a queue.

Economists have historically hated queues. Camping out for a week to get a Tickle Me Elmo is considered wildly unproductive.

But the information age has given rise to a new kind of queue - the virtual queue, where you add your name to a waiting list or click a link at an appointed hour and see if you got the item or not.

Virtual queues eliminate the inefficiencies of physical queues, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they do so without raising prices - the one thing that antitrust law is supposed to ban.

Woodcock makes some good points about the problems with price gouging as a means to "clear the market" (sell all your inventory to willing buyers). The first one is that price-hikes are "excessive" from a consumer welfare perspective.

If Tickle Me Elmo is priced at $24.99, then we know that the vendor considered $24.99 to be a fair price for him. When demand spikes and the merchant raises the price to $50, they're pocketing $25.01 that was demonstrably not needed to incentivize them to create the toy.

That's $25.01 transfered from consumers to producers, which the producers are able to misappropriate because of their market power as sole suppliers of Tickle Me Elmo dolls (IP plays a role here in ensuring this exclusivity).

Woodcock dismisses arguments that these excessive profits serve a market function by incentivizing others to enter the market. Not only are surges often too brief to provide this incentive, but actual surge pricing exceeds the price needed to bring new sellers to market.

For example, Uber's surge pricing has been documented to substantially exceed the price at which more drivers turn on their apps. Uber uses surge pricing as a pretence for price-gouging - as a transfer from riders to the company.

Woodcock's case for prohibiting surge pricing is bolstered by the "administratability" of such a prohibition. Courts have shied away from intervening in pricing because it's hard to set policies and monitor compliance.

A blanket ban on surge pricing, by contrast, is trivial to enforce, especially in the digital marketplaces where it is most widely practiced: Amazon, Disney World, airlines, Uber, etc.

The paper falters in the final section, though, in which Woodcock addresses the ways in which queues can be subverted: he says that informal secondary markets are terrible, but they're still preferable to the problems of primary surge-priced markets.

He misses a couple of points that would make his case stronger. The first is that many price-discrimination markets are intrinsically hostile to resellers, like airline tickets and theme-park admissions, which are nontransferable and keyed to strong identity systems.

The second point is the way that this "consumer welfare" issue crosses over into "harmful dominance." Many of the secondary markets for surge-priced goods are actually operated by monopolists who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; run the primary markets.

Take Ticketmaster, an ugly, criminal monopoly that has grown to dominate ticketing and venues, thanks in large part to vast sums it laundered for the Saudi Royal family:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/02/rewriting-our-imaginations/#mister-bone-saw"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/02/rewriting-our-imaginations/#mister-bone-saw&lt;/a&gt;

Ticketmaster operates its own reseller marketplace, an entire shadow industry for tickets in which they collude with scumbags to ensure that &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; tickets go to fans at face value. Instead, they're sold to profiteers, who list them on Ticketmaster's exchange at inflated prices.

Ticketmaster pockets a commission on each one of these sales - without giving a dime to the performers whose labor they depend on.

&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ticketmaster-resellers-las-vegas-1.4828535"&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ticketmaster-resellers-las-vegas-1.4828535&lt;/a&gt;

Ticketmaster's vertical dominance of the performance industry allows it to get away with this system of wage-theft and price gouging - it's harmful dominance that leads to consumer welfare harms.

But even with that weak third act, Woodcock's paper is fascinating and powerful - and a rebuttal to "consumer welfare" advocates' claims that they actually care about consumer welfare - if they did, they'd be fighting surge pricing.

&lt;h1&gt;Games Workshop declares war on its customers (again) (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/30/space-marines/#fairy-use-tale"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

There's a difference between a con-artist and a grifter. A con-artist is just a gabby mugger, and when they vanish with your money, you know you've been robbed.

A grifter, on the other hand, is someone who can work the law to declare &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; stuff to be &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; stuff, which makes you a lawless cur because your pockets are stuffed full of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; money and merely handing it over is the least you can do to make up for your sin.

IP trolls are grifters, not con artists, and that's by design, a feature of the construction of copyright and trademark law.

Progressives may rail at the term "IP" for its imprecision, but truly, it has a very precise meaning: "'IP' is any law that lets me control the conduct of my customers, competitors and critics, such that they must arrange their affairs to my benefit."

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/&lt;/a&gt;

In that regard, it is a perfect grifter's tool - a way to put &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; on the wrong side of the line for simply living your life in the way that works best for you, not the grifter.

Now, copyright and trademark's framers were alive to the possibility that they might become this kind of weapon, and they wrote limitations and exceptions into each doctrine that were meant to safeguard the public's right to free speech and free action.

But those limitations and exceptions are weirdly self-eviscerating. Both trademark and copyright's limitations assume that they aren't being weaponized by immoral sociopaths. Both collapse if they are.

Take copyright. Copyright has a suite of limitations and exceptions under various global legal systems, including US law. US law also contains a specific set of exceptions colloquially called "fair use," a subject of much mystification for lay people.

Under fair use, someone accused of copyright infringement can ask a judge to find that their use of someone else's copyrighted work is permissible because to deny it would be socially harmful.

The fair use law sets out four factors that judges MAY consider when considering such a claim. Note that these four factors are neither comprehensive (judges can weigh other factors), nor dispositive (failing to satisfy a factor doesn't disqualify your use from being fair).

If that sounds confusing to you, don't worry. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; confusing. As the lawyers say, "fair use is fact-intensive."

The specifics of a use really matter: who's making the use, what they're using, why they're using it, how they use it, and how much they use.

That's why anyone who claims that "X is never fair use" (for example, commercial fanfic) are full of shit - as are people who say "X is always fair use").

Commercial fanfic &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; can be fair use. No less a body than the Supreme Court says so:

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Done_Gone"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Done_Gone&lt;/a&gt;

Despite all this ambiguity and nuance, IP grifters who want to force other people to arrange their affairs to their own benefit are laser focused on the four factors, reasoning correctly that if they show a judge that the factors favor them, they're more likely to prevail.

Half of the four factors are out of the grifter's reach. As a rightsholder, you can't control "the purpose and character of the use," or "the amount and substantiality of the portion used."

But the other two factors are more readily within the IP wielder's remit. As someone seeking control a work, you can frame "to the nature of the copyrighted work" by talking up how much creativity and originality went into it, which judges will weigh in your favor.

More importantly - and disturbingly - is the way that an IP holder can influence the fourth factor: "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."

Think about that fourth factor for a moment here: if my use of your work doesn't cost you any money, then it's more likely that my use is fair.

The corollary: if you can bully &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people into paying for something they've always gotten for free, then you can claim that the people who refuse to pay are ripping you off - that there is a "market" for the use, and that their failure to pay weakens that market.

This is effectively what's happened to music sampling. Seminal albums like "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back" were produced with thousands of uncleared samples - but at the time, &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; was clearing samples.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2011/07/08/creative-license-how-the-hell-did-sampling-get-so-screwed-up-and-what-the-hell-do-we-do-about-it/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2011/07/08/creative-license-how-the-hell-did-sampling-get-so-screwed-up-and-what-the-hell-do-we-do-about-it/&lt;/a&gt;

Had the rightsholders to those samples dragged Public Enemy into court, they wouldn't have had the fourth factor on their side. No one was paying for samples, so a failure to pay for samples had no "effect on the potential market for the copyrighted work."

However, in the 33 years since Nation of Millions dropped, paying to license samples has become common practice - and the mere existence of paid samples makes &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; paying for samples more legally risky.

So say a rightsholder decided to aggressively license simple quotations - as the Associated Press did in 2008, when it offered to sell you a license to a 5-word quotation for a mere $12.50.

&lt;a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010341.html"&gt;http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010341.html&lt;/a&gt;

All other things being equal, a short quotation from a news article is likely to be fair use. But if the AP managed to terrorize enough bloggers into coughing up $12.50 for a 5-word quote, it could create a market for 5-word quotations.

That market would change the fair use argument for people who don't pay - yes, they're making a transformative, critical use, but they're &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; undermining the market for the copyright, and a judge might find this change tips the scales away from fair use.

Even more importantly, the additional uncertainty might stampede more people into paying $12.50 for a 5-word quote rather than risk a $250,000 statutory damages award for copyright infringement.

The more people who pay for 5-word quotes, the sturdier the market becomes and the riskier it is to rely upon fair use.

The fourth factor &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like an escape valve for uses that harm no one.

But it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; rewards to bullies who intimidate others out of money they don't actually owe - until they do.

Trademark has a similar gotcha. Trademark is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different from copyright. Fundamentally, trademark is about protecting &lt;em&gt;buyers&lt;/em&gt;, not sellers. Trademark meant to help buyers avoid being tricked into buying an inferior product because it was deceptively named or styled.

If you buy a can of Coke, you want the true Black Water of American Imperialism, not an inferior brand of dilute battery-acid.

But if your Coke turns out to be a fake, you might shrug off the harm or balk at the expense of punishing the fast operator who mis-sold you.

So trademark empowers Coke - and other vendors - to punish third parties who trick their customers, acting as their customers' champions. Trademark doesn't exist to prevent Coke from losing money to a rival - it exists to help Coke drinkers get what they pay for.

Trademarks can be registered with the USPTO, who nominally weigh trademark applications to ensure that they're distinctive and original. Practically, examiners are busy, sometimes careless, and ideologically inclined to grant, not deny, claims.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2018/06/14/son-of-cocky-a-writer-is-trying-to-trademark-dragon-slayer-for-fantasy-novels/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2018/06/14/son-of-cocky-a-writer-is-trying-to-trademark-dragon-slayer-for-fantasy-novels/&lt;/a&gt;

But you don't have to register a trademark to assert it. You can threaten or pursue legal action on the grounds that someone has violated an unregistered trademark, which is any distinctive graphic or phrase that is associated with your product.

Registered or unregistered, trademark enforcement primarily comes down to whether a "naive consumer" would be mislead by someone else's use of a mark. That is, when you bought a Coke-branded sack of chicken feet, did you think it was blessed by the Coca-Cola company?

If there's no likelihood of confusion, trademark holders struggle to enforce their trademarks.

This standard seems reasonable, but, like the fourth factor in fair use, it has a sting in its tail.

One of the ways you can &lt;em&gt;induce&lt;/em&gt; confusion in the public is to gain a reputation for being a litigious bully. Say Coke is known far and wide for clobbering anyone that uses its trademarks, no matter how trivial the use and no matter how bad it made them look.

If Coke is truly notorious for its zero-tolerance policy, that will lead to a widespread public understanding that every time you see Coke's marks, the use was blessed by a Coke lawyer - meaning a use that might not otherwise be found to be confusing can be &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; confusing.

"If that was any other company's trademark, I'd assume that they had nothing to do with it - but since I know Coke has an army of baby-eating attack lawyers who destroy anyone who uses a mark without permission, that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be an authorized use."

Like fair use's fourth factor, trademark's confusion standard rewards the most vicious and uncaring businesspeople with new rights that their more reasonable competitors do not enjoy. IP selects for sociopathy.

Now, IP - in the most sinister sense of the phrase - has pervaded every industry, but the contradictions of IP are felt most keenly in its spawning grounds: the culture industry.

Culture is in tension with the control of ideas, because culture is the &lt;em&gt;spread&lt;/em&gt; of ideas.

Creators (and execs) are vulnerable to the pirate/admiral fallacy: "When I take from my forebears, that's legitimate artistic progress. When my successors do it to me, it's theft."

This pathology, combined with ready-to-hand IP weapons, incentivizes all manner of wickedness. Remember when Marvel and DC teamed up in a bid to trademark the word "super-hero" so that no one else would be allowed to use it?

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2006/03/18/marvel-comics-stealing-our-language/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2006/03/18/marvel-comics-stealing-our-language/&lt;/a&gt;

These perverse incentives are made tragic by the inherently participatory nature of culture.

It's not merely that Marvel and DC wanted to steal the word "super-hero" right out of our mouths.

It's that super-heroes are culturally important because of how we take and remix them in our lives. Marvel went on to use the law to stop us from pretending to be superheroes online, something Casey Fiesler called "Pretending Without a License."

&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277598023_Pretending_Without_a_License_Intellectual_Property_and_Gender_Implications_in_Online_Games"&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277598023_Pretending_Without_a_License_Intellectual_Property_and_Gender_Implications_in_Online_Games&lt;/a&gt;

Which brings me, at last, to Games Workshop, a company that has consistently led the IP bully pack, indiscriminately terrorizing the Warhammer 40k fans who made it a massive commercial success.

Warhammer is a strategy/roleplaying game that is played with miniature creatures that players buy, modify and paint. If you're not familiar with all this, maybe this sounds a bit like toy soldiers.

It's a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more interesting - not just because of the game rules or lore, but because of the incredibly, unbelievable, &lt;em&gt;jaw-dropping&lt;/em&gt; virtuosity of Warhammer players when they paint and style those miniatures.

There's a reason I look forward to Saturday morning's weekly linkdump from Jonathan Struan of the week's best Warhammer and other RPG miniatures:

&lt;a href="https://www.superpunch.net/search?q=warhammer&amp;amp;amp;max-results=20&amp;amp;amp;by-date=true"&gt;https://www.superpunch.net/search?q=warhammer&amp;amp;amp;max-results=20&amp;amp;amp;by-date=true&lt;/a&gt;

and why I follow incredible painters like Aurelie Schick:

&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/110246635@N06"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/110246635@N06&lt;/a&gt;

Warhammer is intrinsically participatory, co-creative and active - it's not media you consume, it's media you produce.

Games Workshop has become fantastically rich off of this...and they hate it, and they always have.

For years they've pursued fans for producing their own fan-made supplements and additions to the game:

&lt;a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/99301"&gt;https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/99301&lt;/a&gt;

The more Warhammer players complained about the indiscriminate censorship of their fan media, the harder GW cracked down on them, wiping out whole genres of creative work:

&lt;a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/48933/games-workshop-files-purge-09"&gt;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/48933/games-workshop-files-purge-09&lt;/a&gt;

GW claimed it was only defending its rights, the grifter's signature move, making &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; a crook for having the audacity not to put their shareholders' interests ahead of your own.

Then Games Workshop claimed a trademark on "space marine," a generic term that had been widely used in science fiction for decades, including, notably, in Heinlein's classic "Starship Troopers" (1959).

&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130207002144/http://mcahogarth.org/?p=10593"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130207002144/http://mcahogarth.org/?p=10593&lt;/a&gt;

They didn't just go after RPGs that used the phrase - they used trademark claims to remove novels from Amazon for having the phrase in their titles.

"Space marine" is a generic phrase, but GW was betting if they were sufficiently, spectacularly brutal in their enforcement, they could &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; a proprietary interest: "Now, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; GW destroys anyone who uses 'space marine,' so &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; 'space marine' &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be endorsed by GW."

GW just launched a new set of terms of service, including: "individuals must not create fan films or animations based on our settings and characters. These are only to be created under licence from Games Workshop."

&lt;a href="https://www.games-workshop.com/en-WW/Intellectual-Property-Guidelines"&gt;https://www.games-workshop.com/en-WW/Intellectual-Property-Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;

Now, this isn't how copyright works. There are many ways in which a fan film or animation could be fair use, no matter whether GW forbids or permits their production. But this isn't mere overreach: it's a direct play against the fourth factor in fair use.

If GW can establish that all animations and vids are produced under paid license, then any fanvid that doesn't pay for a license has a weaker fair use case, because the fourth factor protects existing licensing markets.

Indeed, as Rob Beschizza points out on Boing Boing, GW timed the terms of service change to coincide with the announcement that they're launching a subscription service including "cartoons, in-house hobby videos, access to a vault of ebooks and mags."

&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/now-even-warhammer-has-a-subscription-service/"&gt;https://www.pcgamer.com/now-even-warhammer-has-a-subscription-service/&lt;/a&gt;

This is bullying with a business-model, in other words. Fans have figured out how to have fun with each other for free, and GW wants them to stop and pay the company for its in-house version of that fun.

Warhammer creators are demoralized and disheartened. The creator of the hugely successful Oculus Imperia Youtube series posted a heart-rending message of surrender.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OculusImperia/status/1421136444437970949"&gt;https://twitter.com/OculusImperia/status/1421136444437970949&lt;/a&gt;

Oculus Imperia also edits "If The Emperor Had A Text To Speech Device," (TTS) another beloved Warhammer fan series. Alfabusa from TTS posted his own absolutely demoralized goodbye to his work.

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXljeaktnDA"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXljeaktnDA&lt;/a&gt;

Ironically, both channels would have a stronger fair use case if they mocked and criticized Warhammer, rather than celebrating it, as fair use tips favorably towards critical uses.

The fact is, they love their hobby and its community and they want to improve it, not tear it down.

Neither wants to get dragged into a brutal copyright case against a deep-pocketed corporation. Even people with &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; fair use cases balk at that:

&lt;a href="https://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/"&gt;https://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/&lt;/a&gt;

Now, some people might be thinking, what's the big deal? Why don't these creators just make up their own stories instead of remixing the ones that come from Games Workshop?

Those people are assholes.

&lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; stories are fanfic of some kind or another. Every mystery novel is a remix of Poe's Murders In the Rue Morgue. Games Workshop's stories are the thrice-brewed teabags of many sf writers (remember "space marines?").

Tolkien straight up ripped off his characters from the 1000-year-old Norse poem "Elder Edda," which features dwarves named "Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Nori, Dori, Ori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur."

&lt;a href="https://musingsofatolkienist.blogspot.com/2015/07/hobbit-origins-catalog-of-dwarves.html"&gt;https://musingsofatolkienist.blogspot.com/2015/07/hobbit-origins-catalog-of-dwarves.html&lt;/a&gt;

Culture is made of other culture.

GW made something wonderful with Warhammer - by plundering the stories that preceded it.

The sin isn't in the taking, it's in the pretense that it never happened, and the vicious grifting that punishes anyone who does unto GW as they did unto everyone else.

&lt;h1&gt;Vaccine refusal and health insurance (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/04/eighty-sixed/#risk-management"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

At the start of the pandemic, the otherwise irredeemable American health insurance industry experienced a momentary lapse in shittiness and agreed to waive copayments and deductibles for covid hospitalizations.

Now, that's ending.

This is bad news for anyone who gets hospitalized with covid, because hospitals have become merciless price-gouging machines owned by private equity ghouls, so even if you're insured, you can get hit with thousands of dollars in bills:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/02/spoil-the-surprise/#surprise-billing"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/02/spoil-the-surprise/#surprise-billing&lt;/a&gt;

But getting hospitalized with covid is a very different prospect today than it was in March 2020: today, more than 97% of the people hospitalized for covid are unvaccinated - part of the 40% of Americans who won't get a free shot.

&lt;a href="https://khn.org/news/article/analysis-dont-want-a-vaccine-be-prepared-to-pay-more-for-insurance/"&gt;https://khn.org/news/article/analysis-dont-want-a-vaccine-be-prepared-to-pay-more-for-insurance/&lt;/a&gt;

Insurers have a long history of refusing to cover "high-risk," as Elisabeth Rosenthal and Glenn Kramon point out for KHN. Get injured while scuba-diving or rock climbing and you might be out of pocket - even the ACA allows for a 50% surcharge for smokers.

But as the authors also point out, insurers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; cover some results of risky conduct - for example, addiction rehab and cancer treatment for smokers.

You may feel a jolt of visceral satisfaction at the thought of a vaccine refuser being stuck with a giant surprise hospital bill, but I think it's counterproductive. For one thing, health insurance profiteering is never good.

More importantly, if someone refuses a vaccine because they don't trust the system - maybe because they watched the Sacklers lie their way into a $10+b windfall when regulators accepted their claims about opioid safety, kicking off 800k+ overdose deaths - this won't help.

I am double-vaxed and would get a booster if it was offered. But the amazing news about vaccines does not make me forget that Pfizer, J&amp;amp;J, Astrazeneca, Moderna and other pharma companies are murderous profiteers who'd kill us all for an extra nickel if they could get away with it.

Nor does it make me forget the collusion between regulators and pharma in the opioid epidemic and other atrocities. Nor that the health insurers make their decisions based on profit, not human health, and have made America a world leader in high costs and bad health.

The fact that so many people won't get vaccinated literally makes me feel sick - but I don't think we can solve their distrust by deputizing the corrupt health-care industry to empty their wallets (or, worse, the wallets of the survivors they leave behind).

&lt;h1&gt;Congress has allocated enough money to end the eviction crisis (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/04/eighty-sixed/#helicopter-not-found"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Bad news: Americans owe $21.3b in total rent debt.

Good news: Congress made $46.5b in rent assistance available in the relief bills.

Bad news: Just $3.25b of that money has been handed out, with 94% unspent.

&lt;em&gt;Fucking terrible news&lt;/em&gt;: The eviction moratorium just expired.

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/housing/eviction-crisis-is-a-rental-assistance-crisis/"&gt;https://prospect.org/infrastructure/housing/eviction-crisis-is-a-rental-assistance-crisis/&lt;/a&gt;

As David Dayen writes in The American Prospect, the eviction tragicomedy was blamed on unforced errors - CDC promises not to extend the moratorium, Kavanaugh's judicial cruelty, Biden's month of inaction, Congress's failure to act - but none of that would matter if relief got to renters.

Now, as the CDC moves to partially restore the eviction moratorium, we should focus on preventing evictions once it expires (again): let's get the $43.25b that Congress says renters are eligible for into their hands.

To do that, we need to understand the backlog. The first problem is that the money was given to the states and cities to disburse to renters, and the states don't have renter relief agencies sitting around waiting to spring into action once Congress writes a check.

Quite the contrary: the states have been starved for decades, thanks to Republicans' and Democrats' race to show who is more "fiscally responsible" by performatively cutting "bureaucracy," without stopping to ask what all that administrative capacity and buffers are &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;.

All that is exacerbated by Congress's insistence on larding the relief with onerous conditions in order to demonstrate eligibility, and a condition that the money be given to renters before being passed onto landlords or utility companies.

The goal is to prevent fraud, which is laudable, but adding administrative burdens to overburdened local administrations was obviously going to result in stalls. The states are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad at fighting fraud, as evidenced by the billions scammed in UI:

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-unemployment-insurance-fraud-exploded-during-the-pandemic"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-unemployment-insurance-fraud-exploded-during-the-pandemic&lt;/a&gt;

Dayen points out that federalizing the program might actually get money into renters' hands before they end up homeless - and it would do an end-run around Republican-dominated southern states that &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; evictions.

&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eviction-bans-expiration-leaves-renters-in-south-appearing-most-vulnerable-11627810842?reflink=share_mobilewebshare"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/eviction-bans-expiration-leaves-renters-in-south-appearing-most-vulnerable-11627810842?reflink=share_mobilewebshare&lt;/a&gt;

Dayen: "We have a serious problem with government functioning, punctuated by an obsession with means testing and state experimentation that turned everyone needing relief into an unpaid government bureaucrat, having their free time taxed with paperwork and endless hassles."

&lt;h1&gt;Utilities governed like empires (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/04/eighty-sixed/#thank-you-come-again"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Tech companies' "mission statements" are easy to dismiss as BS, but they're deadly serious and surprisingly successful in their aspirations to dominate the digital world.

That's how we've ended up in a situation where a single company might control your email archives, family photos, business's cloud drives, home security system, mobile devices and media collections.

But these companies don't act like they've deliberately coiled their tendrils around every aspect of your digital life; they act like you're just a customer whom they can kick off the platform the way a bartender would 86 you after last call.

That's a phenomenon I explore in my latest piece of EFF's Deeplinks blog, "Utilities Governed Like Empires." It's a piece about how policies governing competition, tech, and contract led inexorably to this situation.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/utilities-governed-empires"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/utilities-governed-empires&lt;/a&gt;

Anyone who's ever had content removed or their accounts suspended or terminated by a Big Tech firm knows that Kafka was an optimist - The Trial's got nothin' on the endless customer-support email loops where robots ask questions you've already answered.

The stakes are high - losing your email might cost you the last email from a beloved, dead friend; losing your media account can lock you out of thousands in games, movies, ebooks and audiobooks; losing your home automation account might brick your thermostat and door locks.

What's more, all these accounts - home automation, email, cloud, media - might be just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; account. A single nebulous terms-of-service violation or false credit-card fraud alert at just one company can cost you everything.

DRM laws like DMCA 1201 mean that you can't jailbreak the media you bought, even if the company won't let you access it anymore. Terms of service mean that you sign away any right to seek redress if that happens.

Lax anti-monopoly enforcement means that companies can hoover up small competitors, so that your health-monitoring wearable, audiobook collection, family photos, and other digital services all end up under one company's umbrella.

Youtubers and other creative workers warned us about this - when a content removal or account termination process go wrong for them, they lose their livelihood. Despite the high stakes, the platforms maintain their right to enforce "house rules" - no matter how arbitrary.

This ghastly situation will require multiple remedies to fix. For example, we must abolish rules that ban removing DRM, even for legal reasons (EFF has a lawsuit to do just this):

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-lawsuit-takes-dmca-section-1201-research-and-technology-restrictions-violate"&gt;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-lawsuit-takes-dmca-section-1201-research-and-technology-restrictions-violate&lt;/a&gt;

We must restore muscular antitrust enforcement, banning monopolistic mergers and unwinding the mergers that created monopolization:

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250200891"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250200891&lt;/a&gt;

We should pass the ACCESS Act, which will require big platforms to interoperate with smaller startups, co-ops and nonprofits, so you can leave the big companies behind without walking away from your friends, communities and customers:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/access-act-takes-step-towards-more-interoperable-future"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/access-act-takes-step-towards-more-interoperable-future&lt;/a&gt;

We should make rules for companies that hold our data, requiring them to act with care and reasonableness when it comes to that information:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/information-fiduciaries-must-protect-your-data-privacy"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/information-fiduciaries-must-protect-your-data-privacy&lt;/a&gt;

Digital rights are human rights. The fact that our lives are lived online and governed by high-handed terms of service and opaque corporate processes rather than by the rule of law and universal rights was not inevitable - and it's not too late to change it.

"We have the right to a better digital future - a future where the ambitions of would-be monopolists and their shareholders take a back-seat to fairness, equity, and your right to self-determination."

&lt;h1&gt;Gig workers around the globe (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/22/kropotkin-graeber/#an-injury-to-one"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

My 2010 YA science fiction novel For the Win imagines a global solidarity movement among precarious gig workers paid to "gold farm" inside massively multiplayer online games.

&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/category/ftw/"&gt;https://craphound.com/category/ftw/&lt;/a&gt;

The kids who do this work realize they have more in common with each other than their bosses, and form a global syndicalist union called the Industrial Workers of the World Wide Web (IWWW) or "Webblies."

Gold farming remains a source of exploitative labor, xenophobic in-game violence, and acts of solidarity, but it's only a tiny sliver of the true gig economy, which started with traditional low-waged delivery and driving work and has spread to MDs.

&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/21/1018915121/video-gaming-the-system"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2021/07/21/1018915121/video-gaming-the-system&lt;/a&gt;

"The Global Gig Workers" is a new, important report on the gig economy around the world, published by Rest of World. It's grounded in a survey of 4,500 gig workers in 15 countries, backstopped by seven profiles of workers in seven countries.

&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/"&gt;https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/&lt;/a&gt;

The package includes a dive into the small coterie of investors that are behind the drive to export the gig economy to every nation on earth, delving into how they describe the business opportunity gig work represents.

&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-investors-behind-gig-work-model/"&gt;https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-investors-behind-gig-work-model/&lt;/a&gt;

It won't surprise you to learn that what attracts investors to gig work is the potential to scale up a company at workers' expense. Building the app and bribing, coercing or convincing local authorities to allow it to operate is a fixed cost; running the service is cheap.

The capital costs - bikes, trucks, cars, phones, data-plans - are all borne by workers, who, thanks to systematic worker misclassification, are treated as independent contractors who are not entitled to benefits or workplace protection.

And while the workers must buy expensive capital equipment and have their days scripted to a fine degree by the electronic nag of the app, the company offers them no assurance that compliance and performance will be rewarded with a fair wage.

Not only do workers routinely see their pay slashed after they've established themselves with the company, thanks to unilateral shifts in the compensation structure (as well as changes to the apps to hide how much a job pays until the worker has completed it).

But entire, debt-financed capital investments by workers can be wiped out by a "pivot" in corporate strategy, as happened to Zweli Ngwenya, an Uber driver in Johannesburg who went into debt to buy a car that qualified him to drive for Uberx.

Ngwenya relied on Uberx-style compensation to service the debt on the capital asset he purchased to help Uber scale up its South African business. But then Uber rolled out a cheaper alternative, Uber Go, that didn't require a fancy car, and paid lower compensation.

Ngwenya's wages have "plummeted." He may not be able to service the debt he incurred. A company that expected him to frog whenever its app told him to jump never extended even the thinnest fiction of a reciprocal  degree of respect and care.

There's a lot to be learned from Rest of World's data analysis. For example, there's an excellent article on "How the platform economy sets women up to fail," which traces the gender inequities in the structure of the gig economy.

&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-how-platforms-set-women-up-to-fail/"&gt;https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-how-platforms-set-women-up-to-fail/&lt;/a&gt;

But what I found most fascinating was the introductory article, "How the gig workers are fighting back," detailing how gig workers around the world are making common cause with one another.

&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/gig-workers-around-the-world-are-finally-organizing/"&gt;https://restofworld.org/2021/gig-workers-around-the-world-are-finally-organizing/&lt;/a&gt;

These movements cross sectors - uniting drivers and bike deliverers and grocery shoppers - and national boundaries, as well as the far less permeable barriers between high-income and low-income countries.

Because even though there are striking differences between the lives of the seven gig workers profiled in the package - a doctor in India, a truck driver in Indonesia, a rideshare driver in Ethiopia - the similarities are even more striking.

Even though these workers can articulate benefits to their situation, they all describe the same pathology of their implacable app overlords - a steady ramping-up of work to a dangerous  inhuman pace, a race to the bottom from app companies promising faster, cheaper service.

The same pattern is repeated around the globe. Josh Dzieza's beautifully written longread on the lives of NYC bike-delivery couriers repeats all the themes of these workers around the global south.

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps&lt;/a&gt;

Like my imaginary Webblies, these workers are facing a common enemy, and they're banding together online to fight back. What's more, these workers are canaries in the labor coalmine: if your job can be done by zoom, some asshole is currently pitching that  business-plan.

Teachers, lawyers, doctors, illustrators, writers - the gig economy is everyone's future - it's just not evenly distributed. Whether you're ordering dinner from an app or delivering it, you have a common enemy in the form of rapacious, inhumane global capital.

But it doesn't have to be this way. These businesses don't need to operate at inhumane tempo to be viable. They don't need to offload capital costs to workers. They don't need to misclassify employees and escape fair workplace standards. We let them do it, so they do it.

We can stop them. The beneficiaries of the gig economy are few. Its victims are many. The same tools that offer instantaneous, globe-spanning exploitation can also be a framework for global, realtime solidarity movements.

&lt;img alt="The cover of the illustrated PM Press edition of Peter Kropotkin's 'Mutual Aid,' featuring an introduction by David Graeber." src="https://craphound.com/images/large_1185_mutualaidcover.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Mutual Aid and David Graeber (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/22/kropotkin-graeber/#against-just-so"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Peter Kropotkin was a Russian aristocrat who renounced his titles, became a scientist and anarchist, and wrote many significant works, but none so important as MUTUAL AID, his 1902 treatise on the role of cooperation in evolutionary biology.

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution&lt;/a&gt;

Originally intended as a series of (never delivered) lectures for William Morris's Socialist League, the book was an assault on "moral philosophers" who used Darwin's work and "survival of the fittest" to justify class oppression at home and imperial slaughter abroad.

Painstaking researched and beautifully argued, MUTUAL AID reveals the scientific fraud of "social Darwinism," and its claims that hierarchy and exploitation are evolutionary inevitabilities baked into our very nature.

And while Kropotkin's ideas have inspired generations of biologists AND activists, the social Darwinists have only grown in influence, providing pseudoscientific cover for greed, oppression and immorality.

The folks at PM Press have just published a stunning, illustrated new edition of MUTUAL AID, illustrated by N.O. Bonzo whose neo-Arts-and-Crafts marginalia and full-page spreads are gorgeous and thrilling

&lt;a href="https://www.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=1185"&gt;https://www.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=1185&lt;/a&gt;

Still better are the essays that have been incorporated for this edition: a foreword by Ruth Kinna, a preface by GATS, an afterword by Allan Antliff, and, miraculously, a scorching and blazing introduction by Allan Antliff and the late, lamented David Graeber (Rest In Power).

Graeber and Antliff's essay zeroes in on the social function of social Darwinism - identifying the way that it creates a state of "capitalist realism" where there is no alternative, thanks to "human nature."

I am still sorrowing over David's death, and finding a new work by him, so trenchant and on-point, was exhilarating, even glorious.

If critiques of social Darwinism and evolutionary psychology are your thing, I &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; recommend feminist biologist Anne Dagg's incandescent 2004 book, LOVE OF SHOPPING IS NOT A GENE.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2009/11/04/love-of-shopping-is-not-a-gene-exposing-junk-science-and-ideology-in-darwinian-psychology/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2009/11/04/love-of-shopping-is-not-a-gene-exposing-junk-science-and-ideology-in-darwinian-psychology/&lt;/a&gt;

Kropotkin was a scientist, but he trained as a geographer and biology was more of a hobby. By contrast, Dagg is a prominent and celebrated biologist and her critique has an unmistakable scientific heft mixed with a righteous fury.

In the meantime, this new PM edition of MUTUAL AID could not be more timely, beautiful or on-point. It's a superb volume.

&lt;img alt="Mark Zuckerberg onstage, speaking in front of a large stock-report chart that shows a descending line, captioned with a Facebook 'Delete My Account' button." src="https://craphound.com/images/2696198607_a6f3f7cd02_o-1-1.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Facebook algorithm boosts pro-Facebook news (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/22/kropotkin-graeber/#zuckerveganism"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Facebook is a rotten company, rotten from the top down, its founder, board and top execs are sociopaths and monsters, committers of non-hyperbolic, no-fooling crimes against humanity. They lie, they cheat, they steal. They are some of history's greatest villains.

Because Facebook is a terrible company run by terrible people, it periodically erupts in ghastly scandal. Sometimes whistleblowers or reporters reveal historic crimes, including (but not limited to) deliberately helping to foment genocide.

Sometimes, the scandals are contemporary: either Facebook blithely announces it's going to do something terrible, or we learn of some terrible thing underway from leaks or investigations.

Thanks to a history of anticompetitive mergers - Whatsapp, Instagram, Onavo and more - based on fraudulent promises to antitrust regulators, Facebook has grown to nearly three billion users - except FB doesn't have users, really - it has hostages.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/dont-believe-proven-liars-absolute-minimum-standard-prudence-merger-scrutiny"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/dont-believe-proven-liars-absolute-minimum-standard-prudence-merger-scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;

As Facebook's own internal memos show, the company doesn't just buy up competitors so users have nowhere to flee to, it also engineers in high "switching costs" to make it more painful to leave the system.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs&lt;/a&gt;

For example, Facebook's internal memos show that the manager for its photo products set out to seduce users into entrusting FB with their family photos, because that way quitting Facebook would mean abandoning your memories of your kids, departed grandparents, etc.

Everybody hates Facebook, especially FB users. The point of high switching costs, after all, is to increase the pain of leaving so that FB can dole out more abuse to its users without fearing that they'll quit the whole enterprise.

FB's mission is to increase the size of the shit-sandwich they can force you to eat before you walk away. But they're not mere sadists: shit-sandwiches have  a business model: the more hostages they take, the more they can extract from advertisers - their true customers.

The polite term for what FB has is a "two-sided market" (selling advertisers to users and users to advertisers). The technical term is "a monopoly and a monoposony" (a monopsony is a market with a single buyer).

The colloquial term?

"A racket."

A scam. A bezzle. A blight.

Facebook gouges advertisers on rate cards, then lies about the reach of its ads (like when it lied about the popularity of video, evincing a media-wide "pivot to video" that bankrupted dozens of news- and entertainment-sites).

Facebook didn't set out to destroy journalism by price-fixing ads, lying to advertisers and media outlets.

FB set out to acquire a monopoly and extract monopoly rents from advertisers and publishers, with a pathological indifference to how these frauds would harm others.

Having shown a willingness to destroy journalists and media outlets to extract a few more billions for its shareholders, Facebook has attracted a lot of enemies in the media.

If you're a whistleblower with a story to tell, there's a journalist whose editor will allocate the resources to report your story out in depth. The combination of a rotten company and a lot of pissed off journalists produces a lot of bad ink for the company.

But the fact remains that FB has a vast pool of hostages, billions of them, and it gets to decide what they see, when and how. I used to joke with my human rights activist friends that the best use for Facebook was showing people why and how to leave Facebook.

FB's response was predictable. As Ryan Mac and Sheera Frenkel write in the New York Times, FB's Project Amplify is a Zuckerberg-led initiative to systematically promote positive coverage of FB and its founder - including articles that originate with FB itself.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-project-amplify.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-project-amplify.html&lt;/a&gt;

That is, FB staffers are charged with writing puff pieces about how great the company is, and FB's algorithm will push these ahead of reporting by actual journalists who present detailed, factual, multi-sourced accounts of the company's fraudulent and depraved conduct.

Project Amplify marks a pivot from FB's longstanding policy of issuing insincere apologies for its scandals. Company sources told the reporters that everyone figured out these don't convince anyone, so the company turned to pushing happy-talk quackspeak instead.

One of the leaders of this project is Alex Schultz, "a 14-year company veteran who was named chief marketing officer last year," but the major impetus comes from Zuck himself, one of the most hated men on the planet.

Amplify is just one of FB's strategies for distorting the discourse about itself. In July, it neutered Crowdtangle, an widely used analytics tool that showed that FB's top posts were unhinged far-right disinformation and conspiracies.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/15/three-wise-zucks-in-a-trenchcoat/#inconvenient-truth"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/15/three-wise-zucks-in-a-trenchcoat/#inconvenient-truth&lt;/a&gt;

And Facebook has declared all-out legal warfare (accompanied by a disinformation campaign) to kill Adobserver, an NYU project that tracks paid political disinformation on the platform.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#quis-custodiet-ipsos-zuck"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#quis-custodiet-ipsos-zuck&lt;/a&gt;

By shutting down Crowdtangle and Adobserver, FB hopes to control the academic findings about the company's role in disinformation, hate, and harassment. The company runs its own research portal where academics are expected to access data about the platform.

But as with the journalists who report on it, FB has heaped abuse on the academics who research it.

Its portal data was bad, leaving PhD and masters' theses are at risk of retraction. Mid-dissertation researchers have been set back to square one.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions#facebook-sent-flawed-data-to-misinformation-researchers"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions#facebook-sent-flawed-data-to-misinformation-researchers&lt;/a&gt;

In retrospect, Facebook's decision to game its own algorithm to push pro-company quackspeak seems inevitable. It's not just that no one believes the company's apologies anymore (if they ever did) - it's that  the company seems incapable of hiring competent spin doctors.

Take the WSJ's blockbuster "Facebook Files," a series of reports detailing the company's willingness to harm children, commit fraud, and allow millions of favored, powerful people to violate its rules with impunity.

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-16/facebook-s-promised-to-gain-the-public-s-trust"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-16/facebook-s-promised-to-gain-the-public-s-trust&lt;/a&gt;

FB's response was genuinely pathetic. In a perfunctory blog post, its top flack - the widely despised British politician Nick Clegg, paid millions to front FB on the global stage - vilified the WSJ's reporting without producing any factual rebuttals.

&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/what-the-wall-street-journal-got-wrong/"&gt;https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/what-the-wall-street-journal-got-wrong/&lt;/a&gt;

It's the kind of ham-fisted policy advocacy that Facebook is (in)famous for. Who can forget the absolute shitshow in India over its Internet Basics program, when it bribed telcos to exempt FB and the services it hand-picked from their data-caps?

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-free-basics-india-zuckerberg"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-free-basics-india-zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;

This Net-Neutracidal maneuver, falsely billed as a way to bring the internet to poor people (something is absolutely does not do), was the subject of a consultation by India's telco regulators.

FB pushed deceptive alerts to millions of its Indian users, tricking them into sending a flood of form-letters to the regulator urging it to leave Internet Basics intact.

But whoever drafted the form letter didn't bother to check whether it addressed any of the questions the regulator was consulting on. That made these millions of letters non-responsive to the consultation, so the regulator ignored them.

FB lost! It's almost as though people who are good at fighting policy battles don't want to work for Facebook, and the only talent they can attract are the kinds of opportunistic knob-ends that no one takes seriously and everyone hates.

Weird, that.

&lt;h1&gt;The Halloween Moon (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/23/remedies-beyond-antitrust/#creepypasta"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In "The Halloween Moon," Welcome to Nightvale co-creator Joseph Fink brings his superb, unmatchable gift for balancing the weird and  the real to a spooky middle-grades novel that echoes such classics as Neil Gaiman's Coraline.

&lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-halloween-moon-joseph-fink"&gt;https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-halloween-moon-joseph-fink&lt;/a&gt;

If you're a stranger to Fink's work, the thing you need to know is that Nightvale and his other projects manage to walk the tightrope between weird, creepypasta-style humor and real pathos, in a gloriously disorienting, reeling storytelling style.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2015/10/20/the-welcome-to-night-vale-novel-dances-a-tightrope-between-weird-humor-and-real-pathos/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2015/10/20/the-welcome-to-night-vale-novel-dances-a-tightrope-between-weird-humor-and-real-pathos/&lt;/a&gt;

The Halloween Moon tells the sale of Esther Gold, a 13 year old who loves Halloween more than anything, and organizes her whole year around it. But this year, her parents have decreed that she is too old for trick-or-treating, a transition she is absolutely unwilling to make.

Rather than heed her parents, Esther hatches a plan to drag her reluctant, Halloween-hating best friend, Augustin, out on a rule-breaking trick-or-treat, engineering a ruse to fool all the adults in their life.

But something is wrong, this Halloween night. As the full moon rises and Esther and Augustin begin their rounds of the best trick-or-treat houses, they notice a distinct absence of kids, and no one is opening their doors.

The world, it seems, has fallen asleep, and the familiar landscapes of their neighborhood now stretch and warp in nightmarish ways. Everywhere they go, they find slumbering kids and adults.

But not all the world is asleep. There's the two creepy gents - brothers? - who pilot a pair of shambling, converted ice-cream trucks: one filled with razor-studded apples, the other with pumpkins that explode into walls of flames.

And then there are the mysterious children (?) in rotting costumes, who make eerie, insectile clicking noises in place of speech.

There's Mr Gabler, the dentist-neighbor who earned Esther's undying mistrust by dispensing toothbrushes instead of candy at Halloween.

For a dentist, Mr Gabler's pretty combat-ready, performing extraordinary feats of home defense as they run from the monsters that stalk the night, periodically quipping, "I wasn't always a dentist."

Finally, there's Sasha, a cloistered girl with an overprotective mother who is also Esther's tormentor, bullying her with antisemitic tropes that she barely understands, even as Sasha herself is subjected to racist bullying by other kids.

This is the setup for a wild chase through the endless Hallowe'en night, a night that has been claimed by the haughty Queen of Halloween, who has managed to pinch off a bubble of our world to turn into her eternal domain.

Our heroes must traverse dreamlands, do battle with monsters, confront their loved ones in their own slumbering fantasies and try to awaken them to reality, and confront their own failures and tensions in a fast-moving, surreal-but-consequential adventure.

If you love Nightvale (and you should), you know that dream-logic can be haunting, and sweet, and full of tension and meaning, despite its fuzzy edges and changing rules.

Fink's middle-grades debut brings that same weird and glorious spookiness to a new kind of audience and a new kind of narrative - short, self-contained, punchy and very, very satisfying. It is certified, grade-A monster kid stuff.

&lt;a name="face-the-music"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="A turntable with a caricature of Teddy Roosevelt as a trustbuster, standing on the tonearm, wielding his 'big stick.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/music-trustbusting.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The music monopolists (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/23/remedies-beyond-antitrust/#face-the-music"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Writing in Wired, Institute for Local Self Reliance researcher and anti-monopolist Ron Knox gives a thorough, important account of how music industry monoplization resulted declining revenue for artists, even as the industry itself has reaped greater profits.

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-big-music-needs-to-be-broken-up-to-save-the-industry/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-big-music-needs-to-be-broken-up-to-save-the-industry/&lt;/a&gt;

Importantly, Knox describes how concentration has come to every link in music's supply chain, from radio to recording, streaming to live performance. The monopolists who dominate these sectors fight fiercely between each other, but no matter who wins, artists lose.

Let's go segment by segment. Two thirds of all North American music comes from three labels. The labels grew through anticompetitive mergers: giant companies, awash in investor cash, bought out mid-sized, successful labels, turning them into subdivisions of the Big Three.

The more concentrated the labels got, the worse they were for everyone. They spent the nineties and naughties price-gouging record companies, pocketing hundreds of millions from an illegal price-fixing conspiracy. The fines they paid were smaller than the profits they reaped.

But at least they distributed music. Today, the struggling physical record store industry - a network of passionate music sellers who serve the most intense music fans - find themselves getting "record shipments" that turn out to be boxes of random stuff like cough syrup (!).

That happened when the Big Three all piled their distribution into a single company, the monopolist Direct Shot Distributing. As Direct Shot started to fail, its operations descended into chaos, and record stores started to receive boxes of random consumer packaged goods.

It was bad news for the non-monopolized, music-first record stores, but it barely registered for the Big Three labels - today, they buy an average of two new acts every day.

The labels don't make money from selling records, of course. They get their money from streaming.

Streaming is also massively concentrated, gathered into the hands of just a few companies: Spotify, Apple, Youtube, Amazon - with the notable exception of Spotify, the industry is dominated by companies that also monopolize other sectors.

Monopolies are good to these companies. Spotify's market-cap doubled during the pandemic - the market values its 150m subs (twice as many as subscribe with Apple) at $50b. The major labels get $1m/hour from streaming. 99% of their artists see $25/year in streaming royalties.

Spotify may be the biggest streaming service, but it's not the lowest-paying. Youtube - a Google division, whose unsuccessful attempt to launch an in-house video service convinced it that it had to buy someone else's success - drives the worst bargain.

Spotify uses its industry dominance to extract heavy fees from the labels - creaming 30% of the total revenue generated by a typical track. Big Three monopolists with fat margins can absorb this. Indies? Not so much.

Spotify's market cap growth is in part due to the new ways it's come up with to shake down the labels - a variety of tactics that all boil down to one thing: payola. Spotify will sell labels pop-up ads, placement in "radio" algorithms, and access to "Discovery mode."

Like all forms of payola, Spotify's rate-card is a way for monopolists to edge out indies, buying their way into your ear-holes. I'm sure that the Big Three would rather keep the bribes they pay to Spotiify, but the consolation prize is pretty sweet.

If the Big Three are the only ones who can afford to buy access to Spotify's audience, then creators are driven to sign with them, and have less bargaining leverage when they negotiate their deals.

Spotify, meanwhile, can consolidate its gains by driving up those fees, pitting labels against each other in a bidding war for access to listeners. This effectively drives down the royalty rate Spotify pays, because every new track will have to buy in to get any reach.

Spotify talks a good game about how it uses big data and machine learning to pick the songs you hear, but increasingly, the algorithm is getting far less compute-intensive, a simple sort-by-highest-bidder system you could operate from a laptop running Windows 3.1 and Excel.

In theory, streaming losses can be made up with touring. Acts who attain digital popularity can charge access at  the door to clubs and other venues. The only problem is that live performance is also a monopoly business.

The 800lb gorilla there is Livenation, a division of the ticket monopolist and notorious arm-breakers Ticketmaster - spun out of Clear Channel, the monopolist that we now know as Iheartradio.

Livenation parlayed its access to the capital markets to buy out $1b worth of venues and promoters, before being acquired by Clear Channel for $4.4b in 2005. Today, it's a division of Liberty Media, consolidated with Ticketmaster, Pandora, and Siriusxm.

What goes around, comes around: Liberty's private equity owners are in the process of buying up Iheartradio, re-merging all of Clear Channel's spinouts into one giga-monopolist.

The conglomerate already coerces artists to book exclusively in its clubs and using its ticketing, starving independent venues. Add 850 terrestrial radio stations to the mix and it will choke off all the oxygen that independent venues, promoters and ticketers rely on.

Liberty didn't buy all these companies because it's passionate about music and wanted to ensure artists got a fair shake. By rolling up the entire live music/radio supply-chain, it bought the power to extract vast sums from musicians, and to keep rivals out of the market.

Well, not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; competitors. Lollapalooza co-founder Marc Geiger raised tens of millions for "Savelive," a new would-be monopolist that offered to "rescue" live music venues in exchange for a 51% stake in them.

Savelive illustrates an important point about the nature of monopolies: they beget more monopolies. Consolidation in the labels meant that only the largest streaming companies could negotiate a sustainable rate.

But consolidation in radio drives consolidation in labels - and many of the indie radio stations that survived the first wave of consolidation were picked up cheap by Iheartradio once monopolistic streamers ate their lunch.

This is a pattern across the whole entertainment industry: bookstore mergers and big box retailers drove consolidation in publishing; that was accelerated by consolidation in online ebook and physical book retail.

It's not limited to the entertainment sector either. As David Dayen describes in his essential book MONOPOLIZED, hospitals didn't start consolidating until the pharma industry underwent a wave of brutal mergers and started gouging for drugs.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu&lt;/a&gt;

Hospital consolidation led to gouging insurers, leading to a wave of insurance consolidation. Today, nearly every part of the health industry is monopolized, from pharmacy benefit managers to medical labs.

The only parts of the supply chain that doesn't monopolize - that &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; monopolize - are the ends of the chain: the people who work in the system, and the people who use it.

Monopoly punishes doctors and nurses and other health workers - and it punishes patients.

It punishes writers and publishing workers, and it punishes readers.

It punishes musicians and independent venue owners, and it punishes listeners.

When every part of the supply chain gets so monopolized that it can't easily be squeezed by any other part of the supply chain, these giants turn on us - the workers and users of the system. We, the atomized and fragmented, cannot resist the squeeze.

But as Knox writes, the tide is turning. After 40 years of waving through anticompetitive mergers in the name of "efficiency," the DoJ and FTC are under new management, with two-fisted trustbusters like Lina M Khan at the helm.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby&lt;/a&gt;

This new cohort of monopoly fighters reject the "consumer welfare" theory of antitrust (the idea that monopolies drive prices down and are therefore good for society), going to war against the hegemonic orthodoxy that began with Ronald Reagan.

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/epic-v-apple-d3e59893b4f3"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/epic-v-apple-d3e59893b4f3&lt;/a&gt;

The new antitrust is surging, with bills in the House and Senate, executive orders from the White House, regulatory proceedings at the DoJ and FTC, and an interagency-cabinet coordination committee that ties it all together.

This new antitrust promises workers and users of monopolized industries a better alternative than rooting for one giant to beat another in hopes that they will drop a few crumbs for the rest of us to enjoy.

Creative workers don't have to choose between Big Tech and Big Content based on their assessment of which monopolist will abuse them the least. Instead, we can root for antimonopoly, for giant-slaying, and the right to self-determination.

The most important immediate step towards that future is blocking new anticompetitive mergers, like Sony's bid for AWAL, or Liberty Media's use of a $500m SPAC to go on a vertical monopoly shopping spree.

The agencies have the power to stop these. They should. When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.

But ending anticompetitive mergers won't get us out of that hole: most industries (from beer to cheerleader uniforms to wresting to eyeglasses) are already monopolized.

The new trustbusters - and the ILSR - want to use antitrust law to break up these conglomerates. I think that's right: vertical monopolies will always engage in self-dealing to the detriment of independents, workers and customers. Break. Them. Up.

But breaking up is hard to do. When the DoJ tried to break up IBM, the company's lawyers outspent the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; DoJ antitrust division, every single year, for &lt;em&gt;twelve consecutive years&lt;/em&gt;, and in the end, it escaped breakup.

That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. IBM escaped justice because Reagan was elected and neutered antitrust. And even though it remained intact, it was never the same - for one thing, it decided that it was too risky to make its own PC OS.

IBM knew that antitrust enforcers were very suspicious of tying software to hardware - so it tapped a couple of hacker kids, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, to sell it DOS, from their new company "Micro-Soft."

Unfortunately for all of us, antitrust enforcement only declined after that, so IBM was able to return to its monopolistic ways, and Microsoft escaped from antitrust scrutiny after a mere seven years in regulatory hell.

Antitrust enforcement can sap monopolists of the will to power, as they become increasingly concerned that their actions will attract aggressive legal reprisals.

Think of how Apple "lost" the Epic lawsuit but still "voluntarily" rescinded its heretofore hard rule against apps providing links to web-pages where you can use third-party payment processors to make purchases.

As monopolists lose their nerve, space opens up for all kinds of pro-worker, pro-user interventions, far beyond those afforded by traditional antitrust.

Next year, Beacon Press will publish THE SHAKEDOWN, a book I co-wrote with Rebecca Giblin about the monopolistic corruption of creative labor markets and how creative workers, regulators and fans can resist it.

The Shakedown catalogs the ways that monopolization of investment, distribution and sale of creative works allows entertainment companies, Big Tech, and major retailers to shift an ever-larger share of the creative industry's revenues from workers to themselves.

More importantly, we identify tools beyond breakups that we can use to de-monopolize the industry - things we can do right now, without having to wait for the conclusion of an antitrust suit that might run for decades.

Take reversion rights: many copyright systems allow creators to take back their rights after a set period (35 years in the US). This lets artists who signed bad deals - before they were proven successes - to resell their catalog or extract reparations by threatening to.

But reversion is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to do, and 35 years is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too long. Only an handful of creators - even those with valuable catalogs that could be renewed through reversion - ever manage it.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/06/backsies/#take-backs"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/06/backsies/#take-backs&lt;/a&gt;

Congress (and other legislatures around the world, including Canada, where this is likely to come up in the new Parliament) could fix reversion: make it easier to do, and make it available after a shorter period - say, 14 years.

And what about those bad contracts? The "freedom to contract" has always been subject to limits, where some clauses are deemed unenforceable "as against public policy" or because they are "unconscionable."

With the entertainment sector consolidated into just a couple of states, state legislatures could act to void the most abusive clauses - for example, clauses that allow labels to claw back royalties indefinitely to recoup (often inflated or fictitious) "expenses."

Our book explores dozens of these kinds of ideas, from co-operatives to trade unions; better accounting practices and direct arts subsidies; radical interoperability and collective licensing; minimum wages for creative labor and collective bargaining.

None of these are replacement for reducing the size and power of conglomerates throughout the supply chain, but all of them are interventions we can make as the power and nerve of conglomerates declines, changes that will hasten that decline and open more space for breakups.

And all of them are applicable, to a greater or lesser extent, to helping workers and users of all the other consolidated industries, from health care to cheerleading.

For example, expanding California's ban on noncompete clauses would help fast-food workers nationwide - because today, fast food employers are  the most aggressive abusers of noncompetes.

That means that a fried chicken cashier earning the tipped minimum wage can't quit to work at a burger joint across the street for a $0.25/hour raise. Creative workers aren't the only ones suffering from monopolization - we're not even the worst off.

But by definition, creative workers have a platform. We reach people. We have the potential to help form the kind of unstoppable coalition that we'll need to reverse the generations of oligarchic, post-Reagan consolidation.

You may have heard about how Danish McDonald's workers earn $22/hour and get six weeks' paid vacation and sick leave. That didn't come about because McDonald's was required by law to pay it.

It was worker solidarity that did it. As Matt Bruenig writes, McDonald's initially refused to sign the voluntary "hotel and restaurant" collective agreement. So its workers went on strike.

&lt;a href="https://mattbruenig.com/2021/09/20/when-mcdonalds-came-to-denmark/"&gt;https://mattbruenig.com/2021/09/20/when-mcdonalds-came-to-denmark/&lt;/a&gt;

Now, if McD's workers had struck alone, they'd probably have lost. But Danish law allows for sympathy strikes - that is, it allows workers in other parts of the supply chain to take industrial action to support their sisters and brothers who are striking.

When the McD's workers walked out in 1989, sixteen other sectoral unions joined them. They didn't just help picket at leaflet in front of McD's restaurants!

Dockworkers wouldn't unload McD's shipments. Printers wouldn't print their cups and placemats.

Builders downed tools on McDonald's construction projects. Typesetters wouldn't set the McD's ads in the daily papers. Truckers wouldn't deliver to McD's restaurants. Food industry workers wouldn't produce the drink syrups, fries and other inputs to the McDonald's kitchens.

McD's caved.

Now, as Bruenig points out, these kinds of sympathy strikes are illegal in the US, but it's a mistake to think that workers don't have power because sympathy strikes are illegal - rather, sympathy strikes are illegal because workers don't have power.

Workers across all sectors face the same kinds of monopolistic exploitation. Workers across all sectors have a common enemy (literally, thanks to "common ownership" where companies like Vanguard and Berkshire Hathaway hold significant stakes in almost every major company).

With a shared cause, shared tactics, solidarity and a renewed sense that we can do more than root for the giant we think will mistreat us the least, creative workers and their sisters and brothers in every sector can reverse generations of losses.

That's why the new antitrust matters - because it is an assault on the consolidation that gives all industries the power to shift money and other forms of value from workers and users to a small elite of investors.

&lt;h1&gt;The Scholars of Night (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/mike-ford-rides-again/#cold-war-zeitgeist"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

John M Ford ("Mike" to his many friends) was one of science fiction's most accomplished writers, by which I mean, his accomplishments were so prodigious as to be slightly bewildering.

If he hadn't been so mind-bogglingly quick-witted in person, it would be tempting to believe that his books were the product of several eccentric geniuses. Everything he did, he did brilliantly, and he did so very much.

He was the author of several bestselling, award-winning RPG modules, and a Star Trek novel that was also a Gilbert and Sullivan musical, and a string of genre-crossing novels that used pulp conventions to create transcendent, glittering tales that amazed and delighted.

Ford was beloved of those who knew him. When he died - 15 years ago this week - the tributes were incredible. Here's Neil Gaiman:

&lt;a href="https://journal.neilgaiman.com/2006/09/john-m-ford.html"&gt;https://journal.neilgaiman.com/2006/09/john-m-ford.html&lt;/a&gt;

And the thread on Making Light:

&lt;a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008033.html#008033"&gt;http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008033.html#008033&lt;/a&gt;

But the sorrow quickly turned to horror as it became clear that some kind of complications with his family and his estate planning meant that his work was unlikely to come back into print - that it might just slip beneath the waves of time and sink out of sight.

Ford's death spurred many of us to get out literary estates in order and to name literary executors (if I die suddenly, John Scalzi gets to make the final decisions about my work, until such time as my kid is ready to take over).

From his death in 2006 until 2019, a large part of his legacy was this cautionary tale. But then something &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; happened. Writing for Slate, Isaac Butler detailed his 18-month journey into the mystery of Mike Ford's literary legacy.

&lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/11/john-ford-science-fiction-fantasy-books.html"&gt;https://slate.com/culture/2019/11/john-ford-science-fiction-fantasy-books.html&lt;/a&gt;

Butler recounts many of the strange and wonderful elements of Ford's biography and bibliography - his $3,000 university library fine, the proto-cyberpunk novel he published four years before Neuromancer came out.

Above all, Butler describes his versatility and virtuosity: no two books were ever alike, but every book recognizably and unmistakably a Mike Ford book, and the books were only the tip of the iceberg - the real Fordian legacy was the ephemera.

Ford was a master of doggerel and poetry, of improvised live-shows at cons, maps for fantasy novels (he was Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time cartographer), Christmas card inserts - all of it glittering with genius.

Ford had Type I diabetes and lived a life of economic and physical precarity, struggling to afford care and maintain his health. His friends helped him out, which was good, because he was estranged from his family.

After he died, the story was that they were conservative Christians who disapproved of him for myriad reasons. Butler heard they were particularly upset by his polyamory.

Various of Ford's friends, including Gaiman and Jordan, tried to buy his literary estate from his family after his death, but it didn't come to pass. Ford's friends and fans believed that the family planned to suppress his literary legacy.

But when Butler tracked down his family members, he got a very different version of the tale; they professed great pride in Ford's accomplishments, insisted that what others had taken for estrangement was really just introversion.

They said his romantic life was his own business, expressed appreciation for his partner Elise Matthesen, and claimed they had repeatedly tried to interest Ford's agent into posthumously reviving his work.

While the disparity in different versions of the story of Ford's literary legacy is never fully resolved, Butler does verify one important clue to reconciling the two versions - shortly after Ford died, his literary agent "disappeared" from the industry for years.

She attributed that disappearance to a combination of family and legal woes, and while she says that she didn't get queries from the family, Butler makes a credible case that at least some of the postmortem issues with Ford's work was down to misunderstanding.

That's bolstered by what came next. Butler's investigation led to deal between Ford's family and Tor Books, with Beth Meacham pledging to "gradually bring all of his books back into print, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other uncollected material."

And now, that process has begun. I've just finished readiing "The Scholars of Night," Ford's cold war spy thriller, in a new edition with an introduction by Charlie Stross.

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250269171/thescholarsofnight"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250269171/thescholarsofnight&lt;/a&gt;

Scholars weaves together a global network of spies and historians and political scientists who gather around game-boards to play tabletop wargames, and in secret NATO bunkers for simulated nuclear naval battles.

It's a spy-vs-spy book, but it's a Ford book, so it blends many genres - in this case, historical fiction: its MacGuffin is a lost Christopher Marlowe manuscript that's discovered bricked up in the walls of a stately English mansion.

It's not so much that the plot of Scholars defies description, it's that Ford is so skillfull at bluffing, double-bluffing, reversing, twisting and propelling his plotlines that any attempt at summary will be both inadequate and riddled with unforgivable spoilers.

But this is &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a good book, full of delicious, complex relationships - mentor-protege, comrades, respected enemies, hostile allies, sociopathic pragmist-vs-idealist, and more. Yes, it's a precision watch of a spy thriller, but it's also an astute tour of human relations.

Having Ford's work back among us, after the decade-and-a-half long drought and the doldrums where it seemed it would vanish for 75 years, until the copyright ran out, is a minor miracle, a bright spot in a difficult time.

And there's more good news to come. Last year saw the reissue of Ford's masterpiece The Dragon Waiting:

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250269010/thedragonwaiting"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250269010/thedragonwaiting&lt;/a&gt;

In 2022, Tor will finally print Ford's unfinished magnum opus, Aspects, with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250269034/aspects"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250269034/aspects&lt;/a&gt;

And that's just for openers. The whole of Mike Ford's catalog is coming back. I'm delighted to be able to say that I'll play a small role in this: I'm writing the introduction for the (eventual) reissue of Web of Angels, that proto-cyberpunk classic.

&lt;h1&gt;How the IMF loan-sharks the global south (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/02/debt-trap/#global-arm-breakers"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When you take out a loan or get a credit card, the headline figure is the "APR" - the annual percentage rate of interest. But anyone who's ever borrowed because they were poor and needed money has learned the hard way that APRs are pure fiction.

To get the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; APR (what economists politely call the "effective" APR) you have to factor in the fees, penalties and other gotchas that turn reasonable seeming interest rates into perennial, inescapable debt-traps.

Take student debt. During the 2020 presidential campaign, we had a debate about student debt forgiveness, whose opponents frequently cited the "unfairness" of allowing people to "escape their responsibilities."

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/04/kawaski-trawick/#strike-debt"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/04/kawaski-trawick/#strike-debt&lt;/a&gt;

In their telling, student debt forgiveness would reward fecklessness, allowing people who got the benefit of an expensive education to duck the costs.

Now, even if you ignore the farcical inflation in university tuition and expenses (for example, the 1000%+ hike in textbooks driven by ed-tech monopolists), that's still a highly selective account of how student debt works.

Student debt is negotiated from a position of weakness and naiveté, which allows lenders to attack the poorest grads with incredible fees and penalties. "Chris" took out $79k in student loans in 1982. He's paid back $190k. He still owes $236k.

&lt;a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/student-loan-horror-stories-borrowed"&gt;https://taibbi.substack.com/p/student-loan-horror-stories-borrowed&lt;/a&gt;

That's not the magic of compound interest. It's the magic of loan-sharking. If you've ever used a payday lender (aka a "fintech startup" AKA a "loan shark"), none of this will be the least bit surprising. This form of usury is as old as Christ casting out the money-changers.

&lt;img alt="A.N. Mironov's painting of Christ casting the money-changers out of the temple." src="https://craphound.com/images/overdraftusurers.jpg"/&gt;

The payday lending industry didn't invent these tactics, but they refined, automated and industrialized them, then they spent millions at Trump hotels and (in a stunning coincidence) all those tactics were blessed by the US finance regulators.

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-payday-lenders-spent-1-million-at-a-trump-resort-and-cashed-in"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-payday-lenders-spent-1-million-at-a-trump-resort-and-cashed-in&lt;/a&gt;

The normalization of loan-sharking sent the entire finance sector into a race to the bottom. America's largest banks saw their profits soar during the pandemic due to record overdraft and other fees - in other words, collecting fines for being poor.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/22/ihor-kolomoisky/#usurers"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/22/ihor-kolomoisky/#usurers&lt;/a&gt;

The sums are jaw-dropping. In 2020, Jpmorganchase made $1.5b on overdraft fees, Bank of America made $1.1b and Wells Fargo made $1.3b. The biggest rake came from the worst months of the pandemic.

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/big-banks-charged-billions-in-overdraft-fees-during-pandemic/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/big-banks-charged-billions-in-overdraft-fees-during-pandemic/&lt;/a&gt;

78.3% of all overdraft fees come from just 9.2% of bank customers. At $35 a pop, these fees turn the banks' overdraft facilities into loans with an "effective APR" of 3,500%.

Three thousand.

Five hundred.

Percent.

These are the cold, bloodless numbers of the debt trap. They conceal a vicious cycle in which those with the least pay the most, a cycled that can't even be outrun in death.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation&lt;/a&gt;

Take a moment to (re)read Molly McGhee's Paris Review essay from May 2021, "America's Dead Souls," about her mother's death. McGhee's mom made less than $10k/year and suffered "debilitating depression while caring for aging parents."

&lt;a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2021/05/17/americas-dead-souls/"&gt;https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2021/05/17/americas-dead-souls/&lt;/a&gt;

Her mother was haunted by two warring clans of ghouls: debt collectors who harassed her through legal and illegal means, and con artists who located her through databases of struggling debtors and tried to sell her predatory consolidation loans.

48 hours after her mother's death, these blood-suckers switched to harassing McGhee, as she grieved her loss. Unlike her mother, McGhee had the resiliency and wherewithal (a credit card) to hire a lawyer, whose boilerplate letter reduced the debt  by 90%, over $250k, poof.

If you can afford a lawyer, your parents' debts don't become yours. If you can't, you enter a cycle of intergenerational poverty, with each generation sinking deeper into debt.

When you have nothing and owe everything, debt collectors know that they have to terrorize you into putting their bills ahead of the others. The cruelty is literally the point - without it, you might pay your rent ahead of your mother's old credit-card bills.

To quote Umair Haque, "America is the the world's first poor rich country." an "advanced economy" where a sizable portion of the population lives in conditions typical of the global south.

&lt;a href="https://eand.co/the-worlds-first-poor-rich-country-c411afc68539"&gt;https://eand.co/the-worlds-first-poor-rich-country-c411afc68539&lt;/a&gt;

Not for nothing. The same tactics that impoverish the vast American underclass also work to keep the world's poorest countries - rich in resources and talent - poor. The loan shark here is far more powerful than a payday lender or even JP Morgan - it's the IMF.

A new report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research dissects the way the IMF uses fees and penalties to trap the poorest countries in the world in unbreakable cycles of debt - fees that drive up the IMF's notional APR to dizzying, usurious heights.

&lt;a href="https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMF-Surcharge-Report-2.pdf"&gt;https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMF-Surcharge-Report-2.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

Like any predatory loan, these "surcharges" are levied against the countries that have the least ability to repay. They target countries whose debt:GDP ratio passes an arbitrary line. For the poorest IMF debtors, surcharges account for 45% of all non-principal repayment.

These numbers add up. In Egypt, surcharges gobbled up $1.8b between 2019-24 - triple the cost of fully vaccinating the whole country. Small wonder that the world's 64 poorest countries spend more on external debt payment than they do on their own health care.

In its defense, the IMF offers the same tissue-thin responses that any arm-breaker offers. The claim that penalties and fees are a way to "incentivize" debtor nations not to overborrow, and to seek their credit from the private finance sector.

But these countries are borrowing to pay off their debts - often debts that date back to colonial times, in which the rich (white) world mercilessly looted their resources and fomented destabilizing political divisions.

This undermined domestic resistance to imperialism and allowed kleptocratic, corrupt leaders to thrive - leaders who borrowed heavily to finance vanity projects, corrupt enrichment of domestic elites, and militarized suppression of opposition movements.

All of that was funded by debts, often from the IMF, who tied lending to the dismantling and sell-off of state enterprises, from power to water to sanitation - which is how the world's poorest get gouged by the world's richest to drink their own water.

These countries don't borrow because they want to live outside their means - they borrow because they want to &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;. They don't borrow from the IMF because they're too lazy to ask a multinational bank for credit - they borrow because they can't get credit elsewhere.

But the IMF has another excuse for this: they claim that the fees they extract allow them to originate more loans, creating a virtuous cycle. But as the report makes clear, this is absurd on its face.

The IMF went into the pandemic boasting about &lt;em&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/em&gt; in "firepower" (that's creepy-cutesey IMFspeak for "cash reserves"). Meanwhile, the annual revenues from these fees is $1b - that's three orders of magnitude less than that "firepower."

That means that the IMF could simply give up on these punitive fees, levied against the poorest people in the world, at an annual cost of 0.01% of its reserves. Literally, the cruelty is the point.

The point of all of this? The victims of usury are all in the same boat - in the USA and around the world. The same tactics, the same excuses, the same misery, from Cairo to the Caribbean to Cleveland.

Not all debt is created equal, of course. If you're Elon Musk or Peter Thiel, you can get sweetheart loans and roll overs that let you avoid almost all taxation through the fiction that you earn no income, even as you amass hundreds of billions.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/08/leona-helmsley-was-a-pioneer/#eat-the-rich"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/08/leona-helmsley-was-a-pioneer/#eat-the-rich&lt;/a&gt;

And of course, if you're a government with debts denominated in the currency you issue, it's not really "debt" at all - the only way the US government can run out of dollars is by ordering its employees not to type more dollars into existence in a central bank spreadsheet.

Indeed, you couldn't ask for a starker example of the difference between monetarily sovereign nations and postcolonial countries that owe debts in the currencies of their former conquerors. Venezuela can't spend its way out of US dollar debt by creating bolivars.

Like McGhee's mother, whose debts turned out to be fictions that disappeared as soon as a professional with credentials and access to the levers of power printed out a boilerplate letter, these countries' debts are cruel fictions.

The powerful and wealthy can indulge these  fictions or ignore them, as they choose. For example, finance-friendly politicians can insist that the "debt ceiling" must not be raised, for political purposes.

When the US declines to do the trivial data-entry that would make the money to pay its sovereign "debts," the consumption that the money would have funded still takes place - financed not by the democratic state, but rather by a loan-shark.

National financial "prudence" interrupts the normal and benign process of sovereign money-creation, opening space for usury - private borrowing from the vampires and ghouls whose 3,500% APRs are redeemed through terror.

The cruelty is the point.

&lt;h1&gt;We paid to develop Merck's covid pill (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/06/merck-cenary/#businesslike"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Comparing the government to a household or a business isn't merely inapt (a government is a currency creator, while a household is a currency user - their budgeting constraints are totally unrelated) - it's also profoundly dishonest.

Like, if you really are worried about government "living beyond its means," then you should freak out every time Congress writes a $715B no-strings-attached check to the Pentagon, or sends $258B to the ultra-rich as part of the CARES Act.

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-cares-act-sent-you-a-1-200-check-but-gave-millionaires-and-billionaires-far-more"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/the-cares-act-sent-you-a-1-200-check-but-gave-millionaires-and-billionaires-far-more&lt;/a&gt;

If the government is like a household that can "charge too much to its credit card," then it shouldn't matter whether the spending is going for universal pre-K and Medicare for All or junk bonds and a $1T fighter jet that can't even fly.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/magazine/f35-joint-strike-fighter-program.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/magazine/f35-joint-strike-fighter-program.html&lt;/a&gt;

The household analogy only arises for our ability to house, feed, clothe, educate and care for each other - when it comes to corporate subsidies and blank checks for Beltway Bandits, the whole establishment converts to (transient, highly selective, ardent) adherence to Modern Monetary Theory.

The same is true when we talk about running government like a business, another thing the government is nothing like, and another analogy that is only raised to justify shredding the social safety net, and jettisoned when it comes to handing billions to giant corporations.

Take Merck's blockbuster covid therapeutic drug Molnupiravir, whimsically named for Thor's hammer, which made headlines after a trial in which it was 100% successful in preventing death in covid patients.

&lt;a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/melissabarber/files/estimated_cost-based_generic_prices_for_molnupiravir_for_the_treatment_of_covid-19_infection.pdf"&gt;https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/melissabarber/files/estimated_cost-based_generic_prices_for_molnupiravir_for_the_treatment_of_covid-19_infection.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

A five-day course of Molnupiravir costs $17.74 to produce. Americans - and Medicare, and US insurers - will pay $712 to receive a five-day course of the drug, representing a tidy 4,000% profit for Merck.

But of course, the cost of Molnupiravir isn't merely the cost of production - the major cost is the high-risk capital that was used to fund the initial development and testing. In the world of business, the investor who bears that risk should reap the reward.

Right?

Here's the thing: that investor was the US government. Molnupiravir was developed at public expense at Emory University, which received $10M from the DoD between 2013-15 and another $19M from the NIH. That's a $29M public subsidy into early-stage, high-risk research.

If the US government should be run like a business, then we are the angel investors. Sure other investors came in afterwards - after our investment had vastly reduced the risk - like Ridgeback, who bought the rights from Emory in 2020 and flipped them to Merck.

Like all follow-on investors, Ridgeback and Merck should expect to pay more money for a smaller share. The angel investors' share will be diluted, of course, but only a little. We angel investors took all the risk, and the majority of the reward is rightfully ours.

But that's not what people who say "we should run the government like a business" mean. The business in question isn't a startup with shrewd investors.

Rather, it's more like a schlock Hollywood film, the kind that's funded by star-struck midwestern dentists who are stupid enough to agree to a share of the "net profits" and get nothing, not even a free ticket to the premiere.

If the US government is a business, then American public are the suckers at the table, the marks who get hustled into paying for everything in exchange for nothing, not even the bragging rights. Our contribution is treated as both beneath mention and literally unmentionable.

That's why the pronouncements about Molnupiravir are all misleading statements from Ridgeback and Merck about how they self-funded, and why the only reason we discovered the public origins of the drug was because of crack research from Knowledge Ecology International.

&lt;a href="https://www.keionline.org/36648"&gt;https://www.keionline.org/36648&lt;/a&gt;

Merck and Ridgeback stand to make $7 billion from Molnupiravir this &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;, and the majority of that money will come from Americans paying $712 to take a $17 drug that they already shelled out $29m to develop.

&lt;a href="https://qz.com/2068247/merck-could-make-up-to-7-billion-from-its-covid-19-drugs-in-2021/"&gt;https://qz.com/2068247/merck-could-make-up-to-7-billion-from-its-covid-19-drugs-in-2021/&lt;/a&gt;

Most of those profits &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; come from abroad - because, as Sharon Lerner points out for The Intercept, people in other countries will enjoy a full course for a mere $12, courtesy of a giant Indian generics factory.

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/05/covid-pill-drug-pricing-merck-ridgeback/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2021/10/05/covid-pill-drug-pricing-merck-ridgeback/&lt;/a&gt;

America isn't a business. The US government funded the basic research into this because if we left things up to business, we would be royally fucked. Businesses are risk averse and cowardly and do not fund the science that uplifts us.

As Mariana Mazzucato documents in her landmark 2013 book "The Entrepreneurial State," every successful American company owes its existence to a vast public subsidy - a subsidy that is routinely erased.

&lt;a href="https://marianamazzucato.com/books/the-entrepreneurial-state"&gt;https://marianamazzucato.com/books/the-entrepreneurial-state&lt;/a&gt;

We &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; erase it. If we acknowledge it, we'd know the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; thing we want is for the government to run itself like a business - we want the government to run itself like a &lt;em&gt;government&lt;/em&gt;. We want it to invest in research, and then make that research available on equitable terms.

We could make publicly funded work public domain - or we could condition access to publicly funded work on a maximum profit margin, say, 10% (which would price a course of Molnupiravir at $20). That is to say, we could make public research a force for public benefit.

Because government is not a business nor a household. It is neither a profit-maximizer nor a currency user. It is a benefit-maximizer and  a currency creator - or it could be.

The alternative isn't a government that budgets like a household or runs like a business. It's a government that budgets like a drunken sailor (or a drunken admiral out for drinks with a military contractor's sales rep) and bargains like a star-struck midwestern dentist.

&lt;h1&gt;This Thing Between Us, a neck-hair-stand-up cuycuy horror (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#cuycuy"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Gus Moreno's debut novel, "This Thing Between Us," is a genuinely creepy supernatural horror novel, a book that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and prompted me to turn on the nightlight at bedtime.

&lt;a href="https://www.fsgoriginals.com/books/this-thing-between-us"&gt;https://www.fsgoriginals.com/books/this-thing-between-us&lt;/a&gt;

I almost didn't read it. It's billed as a book about a widower whose smart-speaker is haunted by his wife's ghost, which sounds gimmicky and foolish, but that's a very poor summary indeed.

Thiago is the book's narrator, and as described, he's a widower. Vera, his wife, was way out of his league. She was a finance industry striver from a driven Mexican-American family.

Thiago's also Mexican-American, but his family is anything but driven; he wasn't so much raised as abused, and his dad and uncles were marginally employed and frequently incarcerated - the kind of family Vera's folks despise for giving them a bad name.

But Thiago and Vera made it work in their weird, tiny apartment in a gentrifying Boston neighborhood - right up until Vera is accidentally killed in a botched robbery on public transit.

When we meet Thiago, he's numbly going through the motions at Vera's funeral, narrating it to her memory in the second person, describing his alienation from her family and friends. Alone, Thiago returns to their home.

The home is haunted - but not by Vera. Or not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; Vera. Ever since they moved in, there had been cold spots, inexplicable lights, and yes, a smart speaker that did all kinds of strange things, from playing music to ordering hanging ropes and knives, all on its own.

It was creepy enough that they'd tracked down the seller's agent, and learned from him that the old woman who'd been evicted after a lifetime's tenancy had left the flat in a revolting state, strewn with garbage and decorated with the carcass of a ritually slaughtered animal.

After Vera's death, the strange activities intensify, and now the scratching in the walls can no longer be dismissed as an infestation of squirrels. The smart speaker seems to be talking to Thiago, hinting at contact with Vera's restless spirit.

So yes, there's a smart speaker that may be haunted with the widower's wife's ghost, but that's just the hook. Because whatever is going on for Thiago, it's more curse than haunting. He is subjected to random, spectacular acts of violence, driven to self harm.

He tracks down the old woman who lived there before and she talks to him in Spanish that he can't understands - his language deficiency is another way in which Thiago shames his proud Mexican-American in-laws. Whatever she's saying, it carries an air of supernatural menace.

Thiago is haunted by a cuycuy, a bogeyman out of his awful boyhood, only glimpsed fleetingly and perhaps not there at all. The monster haunts him as he flees cross-country to a remote mountain cabin he buys with Vera's life-insurance.

He can't outrun it. It torments him in ways that are ever more terrifying - even as the tormented messages from Vera, trapped on the other side, increase in tempo and intensity.

This kind of supernatural horror is hard to pull off. On the one hand, if there are no rules to the curse, the tale can descend into the tedium of listening to a stranger tell you their dreams in excruciating detail.

On the other hand, if the rules are too explicit, then the whole thing becomes a kind of pointless card-trick performed in the dark - "I made up these rules, and I found a loophole in them. Tah-dah!"

Moreno walks this fine line expertly and only falters a few times, and then only slightly. The story is hard-driving and terrifying and well-wrought. It's not just a promising start to a long career - it's a fantastic novel in its own right.

&lt;h1&gt;There are no corporate criminals in America (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#get-out-of-jail-free-card"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

If (per the Gospel of St Romney), "corporations are people (my friend)," what kind of people are they? In 2003, Mark Achbar's documentary "The Corporation," made the compelling case that corporations are sociopaths (and hey, look, there's a sequel!).

&lt;a href="https://thecorporation.com/"&gt;https://thecorporation.com/&lt;/a&gt;

Ted Chiang says corporations are a procedural version of the genocidal Skynet AI that haunts the Terminator franchise:

&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway"&gt;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway&lt;/a&gt;

Or, as Charlie Stross calls them, "Slow AIs":

&lt;a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html"&gt;http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html&lt;/a&gt;

When I'm feeling frisky, I call corporations "immortal colony organisms that treat human beings alternately as a source of nutrients or a form of inconvenient gut flora."

In &lt;em&gt;Citizens United&lt;/em&gt;, the Supreme Court declared that corporations were the sort of autonomous persons that have speech rights, and then in &lt;em&gt;Hobby Lobby&lt;/em&gt;, it said that corporations were inseparable from their founders, and not autonomous at all.

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc."&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.&lt;/a&gt;

Corporate personhood serves an convenient fiction, in keeping with Frank Wilhoit's observation that conservativism consists of one proposition: "there must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect."

Or as Robert Reich once put it: "I'll believe corporations are people when Texas executes one."

The reason Reich's quip lingered is because it expresses the obvious (but seldom acknowledged) fact that corporations are the kind of people who break the law without fear of punishment.

That's the theme of "But We Haven't Got Corporate Criminal Law!" - an important (and scorching) essay for the Journal of Corporation Law by Mihailis Diamantis (U Iowa/Law) and Will Thomas (U Mich/Business) for a symposium entitled "Imagining a World Without Corporate Criminal Law."

&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3940447"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3940447&lt;/a&gt;

The authors propose that we don't have to imagine a world without corporate criminal law, because, functionally, that's just the US system, whose corporate criminal law satisfies none of the conditions of a true criminal law system.

A true criminal law system possesses one or more of the following traits: a uniquely demanding procedure; punishment for the worst conduct; the harshest penalties; or the expression of moral condemnation. The US corporate criminal system has none of these traits.

And while the US may not have a corporate criminal system, it has a fuckton of corporate crime. The FBI estimates that corporations commit 20x more crimes than natural persons, crimes committed on a vast scale that even the most prolific human criminal can't touch, thanks to the enormous resources that corporations can mobilize to criminal ends.

Corporate crime isn't limited to "white collar" crimes like wire fraud or insider trading: in recent years, corporations have settled criminal claims for homicide, arson, drug trafficking, dumping and sexual offenses. That's even scarier when you realize the "best estimates of the dark figure of corporate crime suggest that only 5% of corporate crime ever comes to light." Worse still: governments in Europe, Latin America and Asia "are looking to the United States as a model for implementing their own corporate criminal law."

The US model is the worst possible model for international adoption. Corporate convictions are "vanishingly rare": 8.6% of US adults have been convicted of a felony, while 0.03% of US corporations have received felony convictions.

Why can't we convict corporations? For one thing, we don't try. Federal prosecutors sought a total of 39 corporate convictions in 2020 (but they sought convictions in 51% of the 90,000 instances in which employees committed misdeeds).

Those rare instances in which fed prosecutors &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; seek criminal convictions are not evenly distributed: "the larger a corporation is, the more likely it is to commit crime but the less likely it is to be prosecuted for it once discovered."

Or, as Bill Black put it: "The best way to rob a bank is to own one."

What does it mean to be too big to jail? Over the past decade, there were only 43 federal criminal trials with corporate defendants.

Rather than trials and convictions, corporate criminals get "deferred prosecution agreements" (DPAs) in which they pay small-dollar fines and (in 20% of cases) don't even have to admit their guilt.

A DPA isn't like a plea bargain: if you or I face criminal charges and opt for a plea, our punishment will be anchored to the criminal sanctions we'd face if we went to trial - but the whole point of a DPA is to avoid those sanctions.

The authors use Boeing and the mass murders it committed with the 737 Max to show that the US doesn't have a corporate criminal justice system. Boeing killed 346 people by cutting corners about safety, ignoring warnings, and pressuring the FAA to approve its faulty products.

Their sales teams misled customers, and then the company deflected blame on pilots. The crime was the result of a "deeply ingrained" corporate-wide culture of ignoring safety and prioritizing profits over human life.

Boeing was a repeat offender that had killed people before with faulty products that resulted from these corporate defects. It had already settled corporate criminal cases related to these murders.

You couldn't ask for a corporate criminal defendant more deserving of punishment. Instead, Boeing paid a fine equivalent to 3.3% of its revenues (12.7% of its profits) - if Boeing was the median American, that would be a fine of $4,315  - for killing 346 people.

If you or I plead guilty to murder, we would face some form of post-plea oversight. The Boeing settlement also included a(nother) nonbinding promise to do better, without any requirement to prove to its regulators that it was making good on that promise.

Boeing tells us what kind of person a corporation is: a person who can commit murder and get away with it. As the authors write: "we find it very easy to imagine a world without criminal law. We need only open, rather than close, our eyes."

A true system of corporate criminal law would target "the worst offenders, not just the smallest ones," and impose sanctions that would act as real deterrents to future crimes.

That means larger monetary fines, sure - but also "fines designed so that their impact is more acutely felt by key decisionmakers rather than by non-culpable shareholders, low-level employees, and consumers."

Romney took a lot of heat for declaring that  corporations are people, but then he became a Never Trumper Hashtag Resistance Hero, decrying Trump for insisting that the right kind of person be exempted from punishment for crimes (remember "That makes me smart"?).

But even a cursory look at the crimes committed by Bain Capital under Romney's leadership reveals that it's not the impunity that bothered Romney - it was the method.

Romney subscribes to Wilhoit's idea of "in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind." But Romney believes that the "in-group whom the law does not bind" are corporations, simultaneously autonomous (Citizens United) and inseparable (Hobby Lobby) .

Trump's sin is to commit crimes in his own person as well as the person of his many baroque and mist-shrouded corporations - to insist that natural persons can join the unbound in-group without the intervening scrim of corporate personhood.

Because while the Diamantis and Thomas focus on corporate impunity, they could just have easily described the impunity of the ultra-wealthy, a phenomenon entangled with - but separate from - the corporate person's immunity to prosecution.

The kind of person who controls a corporation that escapes prosecution is also the sort of person who escapes prosecution themselves. Romney knows this, but he doesn't want us to think too hard about it.

Because actual people (unlike corporate "people") &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have bodies the state can lay hands on. They have homes that can be picketed. They can face the shame and ruin of criminal sanction.

Corporate criminal prosecutions might change insurer and shareholder tolerance for rapaciousness - but ending elite criminal impunity would actually ruin the lives of the people who benefit from these crimes.

To be clear, we should have both kinds of criminal justice: criminal sanctions against corporate crimes - but also criminal sanctions against the living, breathing human beings who direct them.

If you're an Internet Person of a Certain Vintage, you'll likely experience the same thrill of delight I felt this morning when I discovered ROT8000, a Unicode version of the old ROT13 cipher. But after I finished smiling, I got to thinking.

&lt;a href="http://rot8000.com/Index"&gt;http://rot8000.com/Index&lt;/a&gt;

ROT13 is a toy cipher with a simple method for scrambling text - simply change each character in the message to the character that comes 13 letters after it in the alphabet: A=M, B=N, C=O, etc. You're ROTating each character 13 positions forward - hence, ROT13.

The cool thing about ROT13 is how you &lt;em&gt;unscramble&lt;/em&gt; the message - just rotate each scrambled letter 13 positions forward again, so that it moves a full circle around the alphabet - ROT13+ROT13=ROT26, and there are 26 letters in the alphabet, so ROT26 takes you back to the start.

A+13=M. M+13=A. Or, put another way: A+26=A.

ROT8000 brings ROT13 into the modern digital environment. Our crude, Roman-alphabet-only systems have been upgraded to the Unicode standard, with a whopping 16,000-characters, incorporating many alphabets, symbols and emojis.

Here's a sentence in plaintext. Here it is in ROT8000:

籑籮类籮簰籼 籪 籼籮籷籽籮籷籬籮 籲籷 籹籵籪籲籷籽籮粁籽簷 籑籮类籮 籲籽 籲籼 籲籷 籛籘籝籁簹簹簹籃

(In Unicode, Chinese characters are 8000 positions away from the Roman alphabet).

Compared to ROT13, ROT8000 is actually a tiny, little bit more secure. When you see a ROT13 phrase, like:

Arire tbaan tvir lbh hc/Arire tbaan yrg lbh qbja

It's totally clear that there's some scrambled text there. and because it's ROT13, it's not hard to descramble it.

But if you're not able to read Chinese, then it's not immediately obvious that a phrase like this:

籗籮籿籮类 籰籸籷籷籪 类籾籷 籪类籸籾籷籭 籪籷籭 籭籮籼籮类籽 粂籸籾

is scrambled at all.

But of course, neither ROT13 nor ROT8000 are very secure.

If either were in wide use to detect secrets, someone could easily write a browser plugin that did a basic spellcheck on all the text you encounter, and if it doesn't look like a real word, try a ROT13 and/or ROT8000 operation on it and see if you get recognizable text.

But we really &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; use to use ROT13 a lot. We used it to keep secrets. And it worked.

Why it worked is a fascinating look at all the different meanings that "security" has.

ROT13 was once a mainstay of online conversations on Usenet and message boards.

It was essential to joke forums (where it was used to scramble punchlines) and media forums (where it was  used to scramble spoilers).

You see, "security" doesn't exist in the abstract. Every security measure is a counter to a threat.

A sprinkler system is security against fire - but not burglars or snakes or covid aerosols.

The threat that ROT13 defended against was…you. It was a way to prevent you from accidentally reading something you didn't want to know - a counter to your haste and/or curiosity.

Now, you might have a lot of security precautions you take against yourself. You might throw out all your Oreos when you go on a diet, or set a second wakeup alarm in case you miss the first one, or put all the stuff you need for work in your bag before you go to bed.

These are all measures to defend yourself against you - your lack of self-control, your ability to rationalize nodding off again after turning off the alarm, your forgetfulness while rushing around in the morning.

The thing that makes ROT13 interesting is that it was a way for your friends to defend you against yourself - as is the case with most security, it was a team sport.

Though ROT13 is now an old joke, this "social security" - in which we form groups that voluntarily take measures to defend ourselves from ourselves - has become surprisingly popular today.

That's the point of things like disappearing messages in Snapchat, Wickr, Signal and other messaging tools. Sending you a "disappearing message" isn't a way to stop you from blabbing its contents to others, or even getting a screenshot.

Even if the app tries to disable the recipient's device's screenshot facility, they can install a third-party screenshot app, or just use another device to photograph their screens.

But even though disappearing measures don't make it possible for you to force other people to keep your secrets, they are still super useful - because they automate the process of deleting old messages so you and your friends don't &lt;em&gt;accidentally&lt;/em&gt; leak them.

Communicating by disappearing message lets you and your friends agree that you won't save your correspondence, so that cops or school principals or hackers or border guards or your boss or spies can't harvest them and use them against you.

And it frees you and your friends from having to do anything to uphold that bargain you've made with each other. Disappearing messages aren't an anti-traitor tool - they're an anti-human-frailty tool. They prevent lapses, not betrayal. That's incredibly useful.

We're a couple decades into the slow-motion information security emergency, and it's speeding up, and most people genuinely don't understand the fundamental premise that "security" is always contextual, in relation to a threat.

That ignorance is dangerous. It's what's behind Missouri Governor Mike Parson's absolutely shameful slander and threats against St Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Josh Renaud.

&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/10/missouri-governor-vows-to-prosecute-st-louis-post-dispatch-for-reporting-security-vulnerability/"&gt;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/10/missouri-governor-vows-to-prosecute-st-louis-post-dispatch-for-reporting-security-vulnerability/&lt;/a&gt;

Renaud is a data-driven reporter for the Dispatch; he discovered that the state's portal for looking up the credentials of educators and other school-system workers was exposing their social security numbers.

&lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agencys-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html"&gt;https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agencys-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html&lt;/a&gt;

If you looked up any of the 100,000+ records in the system and then examined the source of the webpage that loaded in your browser, you'd find this information. It was trivial to write a script to go through each page and harvest all 100K SSNs.

Renaud told the state education authority about the problem and his intention to publish on it, and gave them lots of time to remedy the problem (they took the site offline), and then he published his article.

Enter Governor Parsons, who, in a malapropism-riddled rant, denounced Renaud and the Dispatch as "perpetrators who attempt to steal personal information and harm Missourians."

He mischaracterized Renaud's work as "unlawful[ly accessing] encoded data...in order to examine other peoples' personal information." He claimed that Renaud's article "may cost Missouri taxpayers as much as $50 million."

And even as he was vilifying the investigator who had discovered a dangerous defect in his administrator's systems, the governor downplayed its gravity, falsely claiming that "there was no option to decode Social Security numbers for all educators in the system all at once."

Parsons called the investigation a "crime," "an attempt to embarrass the state and sell headlines for their news outlet," and a "political vendetta." He threatened legal retaliation against the newspaper, the reporter, and "all those who aided [them]."

This is a really dangerous form of security illiteracy. A website that sends government employees' SSNs to any computer in the world that requests them is severely broken - even if the code that contains the SSN includes a tag that says, "Please don't display this part."

Security is a team sport. Using a disappearing Signal message to tell a secret someone you trust (but who you fear might forget to delete it) is fundamentally different from sending the same message to someone you don't trust - or anyone in the world who asks for it.

Renaud did a public service for 100,000 Missouri state employees. He deserves the governor's praise and thanks, not his threats.

There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a place for security measures that assume good faith but bad follow-through - they are essential for groups that trust each other.

But a public website is visible to the whole world, which, by definition, includes literally everyone in the world you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; trust. Sending sensitive information to people you don't trust but tagging it "Please don't look at this" is obviously bad security.

ROT13 - and ROT8000 - are useful for hiding spoilers or joke punchlines, or making sure the person whose birthday party you're planning doesn't accidentally ruin the surprise.

But if you used them to scramble Social Security Numbers - and then literally threatened to imprison the reporter who pointed out that this is a bad idea - you reveal yourself to be a fool.

&lt;h1&gt;Risk compensation considered harmful (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/10/elfin-safety/#mene-mene-tekel"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The politicization of covid started early, with the "noble lie" that masks wouldn't prevent the spread of the disease, a lie told in a bid to prevent panic-shoppers buying up all the N95s that health workers needed.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html&lt;/a&gt;

Safety talk is often a pretext: sometimes paternalistic, sometimes authoritarian and sometimes (ironically) anti-regulatory.

The British "health and safety gone mad" panic of the 1990s is a perfect microcosm of how this works. After a revolution in evidence-based public safety measures improved the daily lives of millions of people, puny authoritarians and grifters of every stripe realized that safety talk was a powerful weapon for bossing people around while lining their pockets.

In their 2014 book "In the Interest of Safety," Sense About Science's Tracey Brown and Michael Hanlon document the way that bosses, consultants and cranks used "health and safety" as an unquestionable justification to make other people do their bidding.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2014/09/08/in-the-interests-of-safety-using-evidence-to-beat-back-security-theater/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2014/09/08/in-the-interests-of-safety-using-evidence-to-beat-back-security-theater/&lt;/a&gt;

Safety talk enabled both the theater manager who insisted that everyone in the audience of Peter Pan wear helmets during the wire-flying scenes and the tube-platform supervisor who banned cleaners from wearing warm hats in the winter months ("so they can hear oncoming trains").

It also gave rise to a class of consultants who made outlandish claims about safety requirements that led to lucrative contracts. The most bizarre example was the grifters who went around graveyards &lt;em&gt;kicking over old tombstones&lt;/em&gt; to prove they could topple on a mourner. They then sold special tombstone-bracing services up and down the nation.

"Health and safety" is still a punchline in the UK, thanks to all of this nonsense - despite the fact that &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of this was the result of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; health and safety regulation. Rather, it was an unquestionable, all-purpose excuse wielded by the greedy and foolish.

The major casualty of this abuse wasn't the millions spent on tombstone reinforcement or the absurdity of wearing a helmet for Peter Pan's flight - it was the discrediting of the very idea of evidence-based safety. You can trace a straight path from turning health and safety into a punchline, to the Grenfell fire and the national epidemic of lethally flammable building cladding. Every time someone brought up the possibility that it might be a bad idea to sheathe high-rises in, basically, solid-state gasoline, they were jeered at as "health and safety" weirdos.

But long before the British health-and-safety wheeze, American corporate apologists were weaponizing safety talk, led by Sam Peltzman an economist at (where else) the University of Chicago.

In 1975, Peltzman published a landmark study that purported to finally validate the "risk compensation" hypothesis: the idea that when you make things safer, people engage in riskier behavior, with overall safety declining as a result.

&lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/260352"&gt;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/260352&lt;/a&gt;

Peltzman's paper was intended as an evidence-based rejoinder to seatbelt laws - laws that auto manufacturers vehemently opposed. But there was just one problem: Peltzman's paper was "riddled with errors" and Peltzman did not perform "rudimentary checks on the validity of his model."

&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-576X/2/3/16/htm"&gt;https://www.mdpi.com/2313-576X/2/3/16/htm&lt;/a&gt;

Peltzman was wrong, but he was also useful. As Tim Requarth writes in Slate, Peltzman's ideas failed to stop seatbelts, but they did lead to widespread motorcycle helmet law repeals - and a wave of fatalities and maimings.

&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/11/risk-compensation-debunked-masks-rapid-tests-vaccines-safety.html"&gt;https://slate.com/technology/2021/11/risk-compensation-debunked-masks-rapid-tests-vaccines-safety.html&lt;/a&gt;

Risk compensation does occur in very narrow and specific circumstances, but all the studies purporting to show that it is a widespread, predictable outcome of any safety regulation have failed to replicate.

But just as health-and-safety panic served a useful purpose, so does risk compensation fraud: it serves as an unassailable justification for both big-business-friendly deregulation and authoritarian sex-negativity.

Risk compensation helps corporations that want to avoid retooling to comply with safety measures, such as fighting child safety caps on medicine:

&lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7556/jaoa.2006.106.7.405/html"&gt;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7556/jaoa.2006.106.7.405/html&lt;/a&gt;

More prominently, it's used as empirical facewash for blue-nose moralizing. Risk compensation was used to fight the Pill ("it'll make women promiscuous"):

&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/wellness/1995/05/16/what-the-pill-did/65d876af-0274-4200-b60b-96d04828b33a/"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/wellness/1995/05/16/what-the-pill-did/65d876af-0274-4200-b60b-96d04828b33a/&lt;/a&gt;

HPV vaccines ("they'll make kids promiscuous"):

&lt;a href="https://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1206813,00.html"&gt;https://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1206813,00.html&lt;/a&gt;

Syphilis treatment ("they'll make everyone promiscuous"):

&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4626515/"&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4626515/&lt;/a&gt;

PrEP ("it'll make gay and bisexual men promiscuous"):

&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jia2.25351"&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jia2.25351&lt;/a&gt;

The morning-after pill ("it will encourage unprotected sex"):

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/24/gender.lifeandhealth"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/24/gender.lifeandhealth&lt;/a&gt;

Risk compensation is also the excuse of choice to fight drug-related harm reduction, especially needle exchanges ("if we give addicts clean needles, they'll shoot up more"):

&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936850/"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936850/&lt;/a&gt;

Risk compensation and health-and-safety panic are both part of a safety nihilism campaign that serves big business's deregulatory agenda, and the cruel moralizing of right wing religious maniacs, the traditional turkeys-voting-for-Christmas coalition.

But risk compensation is especially salient in these covid days, where it's being used to fight rapid testing ("encourages risky behavior").

The problem isn't the difficulty of formulating good health and safety policy, though that difficulty is real. The problem is that, having ruled health policy to be above question or scrutiny, we invite paternalism and authoritarianism. Whether it's a noble lie, a grift, a moral panic, or a deregulatory fraud, abuse of safety rhetoric always comes to light. When it does, it discredits the whole project of evidence-based safety.

And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is a truly unsafe situation.

&lt;h1&gt;Massive Predpol leak confirms that it drives racist policing (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/02/empirical-facewash/#geolitica"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When you or I seek out evidence to back up our existing beliefs and ignore the evidence that shows we're wrong, it's called "confirmation bias." It's a well-understood phenomenon that none of us are immune to, and thoughtful people put a lot of effort into countering it in themselves.

But confirmation bias isn't always an unconscious process. Consultancies like McKinsey have grown to multibillion-dollar titans by offering powerful people confirmation bias as a service: pay them enough and they'll produce a fancy report saying whatever you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do is the best thing you possibly &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/25/strikesgiving/#cool-story-pharma-bro"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/25/strikesgiving/#cool-story-pharma-bro&lt;/a&gt;

A sizable fraction of the machine learning bubble is driven by this phenomenon. Pay a machine learning company enough money and they'll produce a statistical model that proves that whatever terrible thing you're doing is empirical and objective and true. After all, "Math doesn't lie."

The best term I've heard for this is "empirical facewash." I learned that term from Patrick Ball, in a presentation on the Human Rights Data Analysis Group's outstanding study of racial bias in predictive policing tools.

&lt;a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/156286/crime-prediction-tool-pred-pol-only-amplifies-racially-biased-policing-study-shows"&gt;https://www.mic.com/articles/156286/crime-prediction-tool-pred-pol-only-amplifies-racially-biased-policing-study-shows&lt;/a&gt;

(Sidenote: HRDAG just won the prestigious Rafto Prize, a major international award for human rights work)

&lt;a href="https://hrdag.org/2021/09/23/hrdag-wins-the-rafto-prize/"&gt;https://hrdag.org/2021/09/23/hrdag-wins-the-rafto-prize/&lt;/a&gt;

(And on that note, HRDAG is a shoestring operation that turns our tax-deductible donations into reliable statistical accounts of human rights abuses that are critical to truth and reconciliation, human rights tribunals, and trials for crimes against humanity. I am an annual donor and you should consider them in your giving, too)

&lt;a href="https://hrdag.networkforgood.com/"&gt;https://hrdag.networkforgood.com/&lt;/a&gt;

Here's how Ball described that predictive policing research: everybody knows that cops have a racist policing problem, but we don't all agree on what that problem is. You and I might think that the problem is that cops make racially motivated arrests, while the cops and their apologists think the problem is that we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the cops make racially motivated arrests.

By feeding crime data into a machine learning model, and then asking it to predict where crime will take place based on past patterns of crime data, cops can get an "objective" picture of where to concentrate their policing activities.

But this has major problems. First, it presumes that crime stats are objective - that everyone reports crime at the same rate, and that the police investigate suspects at the same rate. In other words, this starts from the presumption that there is no racial bias in crime statistics - and then uses that presumption to prove that there is no racial bias in crime statistics!

Second, this presumes that undetected crimes are correlated with detected ones. In other words, if the cops detect a lot of crime in a poor neighborhood - and not in a rich neighborhood - then all the undetected crimes are also in those poor neighborhoods.

Finally, this presumes that every crime is a crime! In other words, it presumes that there are no de facto crimes like "driving while brown" or "walking your dog while black." Some of the "crimes" in the crime stats aren't actually crimes - rather, they're pretextual stops that turn into plea deals after bullying prosecutors threaten a long prison sentence.

HRDAG's work crystallized the critique of machine learning as a tool for correcting systemic bias, and it has been my touchstone for understanding other bias-reinforcing/bias-accelerating machine learning scandals. It's a critical adjunct to such foundational texts as Cathy O'Neil's "Weapons of Math Destruction":

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2016/09/06/weapons-of-math-destruction-invisible-ubiquitous-algorithms-are-ruining-millions-of-lives/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2016/09/06/weapons-of-math-destruction-invisible-ubiquitous-algorithms-are-ruining-millions-of-lives/&lt;/a&gt;

And Virginia Eubanks's "Automating Inequality."

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2018/01/31/automating-inequality-using-algorithms-to-create-a-modern-digital-poor-house/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2018/01/31/automating-inequality-using-algorithms-to-create-a-modern-digital-poor-house/&lt;/a&gt;

But you don't need to look to outside sources for evidence that predictive policing reinforces and accelerates racial bias. The founders of Predpol - the leading predictive policing tool - came to the same conclusion in 2018, but decided not to do anything about it.

&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8616417"&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8616417&lt;/a&gt;

That may sound shocking, but really, it's par for the course with Predpol, which rebranded itself as Geolitica in order to distance itself from a string of scandals and bad publicity.

From the start, Predpol has wrapped its operations in secrecy, pressuring police forces to hide their use of the service from city officials and residents. Back in 2018, a security researcher provided me with a list of cities that seemed to have secretly procured Predpol services.

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/10/30/el-monte-and-tacoma.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2018/10/30/el-monte-and-tacoma.html&lt;/a&gt;

In 2019, Motherboard's Caroline Haskins used that report to extract even more information about the cops' secret deals with Predpol:

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/d3m7jq/dozens-of-cities-have-secretly-experimented-with-predictive-policing-software"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/d3m7jq/dozens-of-cities-have-secretly-experimented-with-predictive-policing-software&lt;/a&gt;

All this started because my source was able to learn that these cities were experimenting with Predpol's digital phrenology due to basic cybersecurity errors the company had made.

Predpol's cybersecurity has not improved since. A team of reporters from Gizmodo and The Markup just published a blockbuster report on Predpol's role in biased policing, using the largest Predpol leak in history. Data regarding &lt;em&gt;5.9 million&lt;/em&gt; Predpol predictions was left on an unsecured server!

&lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/prediction-bias/2021/12/02/crime-prediction-software-promised-to-be-free-of-biases-new-data-shows-it-perpetuates-them"&gt;https://themarkup.org/prediction-bias/2021/12/02/crime-prediction-software-promised-to-be-free-of-biases-new-data-shows-it-perpetuates-them&lt;/a&gt;

The Markup/Gizmodo team used that dataset to conduct a massive study on racial bias in predictive policing. As American University's Andrew Ferguson put it, "No one has done the work you guys are doing, which is looking at the data." This is "striking because people have been paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for this technology for a decade."

Ferguson's point - that public millions have been poured into an experimental technology without any external validation - is important. After all, it's unlikely that cops and Predpol keep this stuff a secret from us because they know we'll love it and they don't want to ruin the pleasant surprise.

On the other hand, it makes perfect sense if Predpol is really selling empirical facewash - that is, confirmation bias as a service.

That certainly seems to be the case based on the analysis published today. Police who rely on Predpol do less patrolling in white and affluent neighborhoods (these are pretty much the same neighborhoods in most of the USA, of course). But when it comes communities of color and poor communities, Predpol predictions send cops flooding in: "A few neighborhoods in our data were the subject of more than 11,000 predictions."

When Predpol sends cops into your neighborhood, arrests shoot up (you find crime where you look for it), as does use of force. This has knock-on effects - for example, the reporters tell the story of Brianna Hernandez, who was evicted, along with her two young children from low-income housing. Her partner was stopped in his car while dropping off some money for her. He had an old court injunction barring him from being on the premises because of a crime he committed 14 years earlier, while he was a minor. The housing complex had a policy of evicting tenants who associated with people who committed crimes, and it had been the target of a flood of Predpol predictions.

Brianna doesn't know if she and her children were made homeless because of a Predpol prediction, thanks to the secrecy Predpol and its customers hide behind.

Robert McCorquodale - the Calcasieu Parish, LA sheriff's attorney who handles public records requests - refused to confirm whether they used Predpol, despite the fact that the data-leak clearly confirmed they were. He cited "public safety and officer safety" and speculated that if criminals knew Predpol was in use, they'd be able to outwit it: "I feel this is not a public record."

Unsurprisingly, police reform advocates in six of the cities where Predpol was in use didn't know about it: "Even those involved in government-organized social justice committees said they didn’t have a clue about it."

All this secrecy helps hide the fact that a) Predpol is expensive and b) it doesn't work. But many police departments are wising up. LAPD was Predpol's first big reference customer - and they stopped using it in 2020, citing financial constraints and a damning Inspector General report.

It's not just LA. Santa Cruz - the birthplace of Predpol - also fired the company last year:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/27/belated-oppenheimers/#banana-slugs"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/27/belated-oppenheimers/#banana-slugs&lt;/a&gt;

There's a limited pool of mathematicians who can produce the kind of convincing confirmation bias as a service that Predpol sells, and it's shrinking. 1,400 mathematicians have signed an open letter "begging their colleagues not to collaborate on research with law enforcement, specifically singling out Predpol."

&lt;h1&gt;When you hear "one size fits all," think "universal" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/05/universalism/#shibboleths"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Once, the phrase "one size fits all" was a futuristic boast offered by manufacturers availing themselves of new, high-tech materials that stretched and flexed without tearing or deforming. Today, it's a curse-word used to damn universal programs. What happened?

As is so often the case with big linguistic shifts, the culprit is capitalist realism, the ideology that there is no alternative to unfettered profit-seeking, which relies heavily on linguistic games. Much of our vocabulary is infected with these ideological shibboleths. For example, "free markets" - a term that once referred to markets free from "rent" (passive income collection by asset-owners that productive firms had to deal with) has now come to mean the opposite: markets today are only "free" if you can extract rent from assets, rather than production:

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/03/cory-doctorow-free-markets/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2021/03/cory-doctorow-free-markets/&lt;/a&gt;

Scientific terms are heavily represented in capitalist realism's lexicon - and why not? If you want to convince people that your ideology is inevitable, cloaking it in science can make your preferences seem like immutable laws of nature, as inescapable as gravity. For example, "learned helplessness," the evidence-free conviction that a state that helps people with the essentials for human thriving (health care, shelter, nutrition, education, etc) will make those people literally incapable of procuring those necessities for themselves.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/01/learned-helplessness/#bag-o-money"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/01/learned-helplessness/#bag-o-money&lt;/a&gt;

(Of course, "learned helplessness" doesn't apply to aerospace companies that receive multibillion-dollar bailouts!)

The demonization of "one size fits all" didn't find its way into the neoliberal Devil's Dictionary by accident. As Lawrence Glickman writes for the Boston Review, it was tied to a deliberate, late-1970s effort to kill the New Deal's ethic of universal services:

&lt;a href="https://bostonreview.net/articles/in-praise-of-one-size-fits-all/"&gt;https://bostonreview.net/articles/in-praise-of-one-size-fits-all/&lt;/a&gt;

Take Ed Clark, the Koch-backed Libertarian presidential candidate in 1980 (his running mate was David Koch). Clark used "one size fits all" to attack on the idea of universal, public education, calling the system an "educational straitjacket."

By the 1990s, "one size fits all" was the go-to way to criticize any universal program, including (and especially) programs that protected the civil rights of minorities. In 1990, James J Kilpatrick used the phrase to damn "motor voter" laws that automatically combine voter registration with drivers' licenses. The trick worked so well that he used it again to attack a family and medical leave bill.

&lt;a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88936622/tucson-citizen/"&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88936622/tucson-citizen/&lt;/a&gt;

It worked. When GHW Bush's vetoed the Family and Medical Bill, he repeated the phrase: "By substituting a ‘one size fits all’ government mandate for innovative individual agreements, this bill ignores the differing family needs and preferences of employees..."

The phrase was a favorite of Bush's and was trotted out whenever a universal program was under discussion, including his analysis of the uprising after the acquittal of the dirty cops who beat Rodney King:

&lt;a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88938095/the-orlando-sentinel/"&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88938095/the-orlando-sentinel/&lt;/a&gt;

The GHW Bush years saw "one size fits all" converted into a "one attack kills all" superweapon to justify all kinds of institutional cruelty. Bush Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole used it to fight universal child-care. His Council of Environmental Quality chair Michael R Deland used it to kill the 1992's UN climate change goals.

Many have noted Bill Clinton's successful adoption of neoliberal policies and rhetoric in a bid to move the party away from universalism and labor advocacy into a party of finance and global capital. Clinton was happy to use the right's language, and "one size fits all" was no exception. In 1992, he gave a campaign speech promising his government wouldn't deploy "one size fits all" policies.

Corporate Dems ran with "one size fits all" as a key to promoting "entrepreneurial government." The phrase is sprinkled through "Reinventing Government: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit is Transforming the Public Sector," Obsorne and Gaebler's Clintonite bible.

By 1996, Clinton was using the phrase in his State of the Union address: "the era of big, centralized, one-size-fits-all government is over."

But you can't out-GOP the GOP. Its 1992 platform damned universal access to child care as "one size fits all." In 1996, it used "one size fits all" to fight nationwide interstate highway speed-limits. In 2000, its platform promised to dismantle Medicare because it was a "one size fits all" solution.

The demonization of universal services with "one size fits all" talk grew and grew. Rick Perry used it to attack the Affordable Care Act in 2015. Today, it's being used to condemn the Build Back Better Act:

&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/11/8-big-problems-with-joe-bidens-build-back-better-bill/"&gt;https://nypost.com/2021/11/11/8-big-problems-with-joe-bidens-build-back-better-bill/&lt;/a&gt;

The 5th Circuit Appellate Division just took it up in its decision banishing vaccine mandates for federal contractors, calling mandates a "one-size-fits-all sledgehammer." Republican lawmakers like Joni Ernst use "one size fits all" to fight the $15 minimum wage:

&lt;a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88932186/the-news-and-observer/"&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88932186/the-news-and-observer/&lt;/a&gt;

Ernst called a $15 minimum wage a "policy set by Washington politicians," but as Glickman dryly points out, another phrase for this is "a federal law." Literally every federal law is "a policy set by Washington politicians."

Seen in this light, "one size fits all" is of a piece with talk about "states' rights" as a justification for voter suppression and other Jim Crow (and New Jim Crow) policies.

Of course, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; places where universalism should give way to customization and exception: Crime Bill cruelties like mandatory minimum sentences and three-strikes laws (and other "zero tolerance" policies) are incapable of producing nuanced, just outcomes, and there's a rich record of their failures. But these aren't the "one size fits all" policies that conservatives condemn.

Their aim is reserved for universal policies like mask mandates - policies that are intrinsically about social problems, where the right to individual preferences can't trump the collective right to safety. Masks work, folks:

&lt;a href="https://documentingcovid19.io/state/MO"&gt;https://documentingcovid19.io/state/MO&lt;/a&gt;

What's more, there's nothing about universalism that says customization and individualism must be sidelined. It was public, universally accessible alternative schools that made me the person I am today:

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/give-me-slack-b4e88a007dbf"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/give-me-slack-b4e88a007dbf&lt;/a&gt;

Today, those schools have been all-but abolished by the same conservative ideology that made "one size fits all" into a dirty word.

&lt;h1&gt;As stocks tumble, wealthy speculators bid up house prices (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/27/extraordinary-popular-delusions/#wall-street-slumlords"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The Obama administration's most consequential decision was to address the Great Financial Crisis by bailing out the finance sector, rather than borrowers. It was an unforced error, directed by Goldman-Sachs bankers elevated to the ranks of finance regulators, and we are still living with its consequences.

The choice to enact quantitative easing (rather than debt relief, direct transfers to consumers, or regulation of mortgage-backed securities) triggered the foreclosure crisis, wiped out family wealth (especially Black wealth, which declined more under Obama than any other president), and produced a still-inflating asset bubble.

It also set a precedent, shifting the Overton window in a way that made the trillions that Trump pumped into the capital markets (first through massive tax-cuts, then through covid programs) seem bipartisan.

Today, the capital markets are utterly uncoupled from the real economy. The stock market's unprecedented bull run coincided with a decline in the fortunes of real businesses and real workers, and the overslosh produced bubbles in other asset classes, including some absolutely absurd ones (cryptos/NFTs, wine, art, supercars, sports collectibles, etc).

The rich have too much money, and nowhere to put it and so the economy is in metastatic, stage-four ponzi-ism.

Many asset bubbles are indirectly harmful - e.g. the climate consequences of crypto, or the way easy capital has spurred even more mergers and monopolization, with the attendant layoffs and worsening labor conditions. Asset inflation has also spurred investment in predatory enterprises like Uber and Doordash, who use investor cash to subsidize a money-losing operation that strangles real, locally owned businesses.

But there's one asset bubble that has an immediate and direct harmful effect: the housing bubble. Since the Great Financial Crisis, Wall Street has been hell-bent on acquiring single-family homes, converting them to rental property, gouging on rent, skimping on maintenance, and evicting on the flimsiest pretense.

&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-housing-invitation/"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-housing-invitation/&lt;/a&gt;

By every metric, Wall Street investors are the worst landlords, and they're the fastest-growing class of landlord. These two facts are related. Big firms are able to buy up so much housing because they are able to borrow cheaply, issuing bonds that "securitize" the rent payments from tenants. Access to this capital is dependent on the ability to raise rents and scare tenants into silence over dangerous living conditions. In other words, Wall Street firms can only corner the market on housing if they promise their investors that they'll brutalize and beggar their tenants.

&lt;a href="https://gen.medium.com/the-rents-too-damned-high-520f958d5ec5"&gt;https://gen.medium.com/the-rents-too-damned-high-520f958d5ec5&lt;/a&gt;

Wall Street's plan to financialize the roof over your head is a deeply corrupting project, one that involves pumping hundreds of millions in dark money into defeating tenant's rights and rent controls:

&lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/151783/deceptive-shameful-lucratively-funded-war-rent-control"&gt;https://newrepublic.com/article/151783/deceptive-shameful-lucratively-funded-war-rent-control&lt;/a&gt;

Stein's Law predicts that "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop." Bubbles can't go on forever. The stock market has been swinging like a drunkard around a lamppost for the past week. Cryptos are tumbling. Rugpulls are dominating the NFT market. I don't know about sports memorabilia, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was in trouble, too.

But the rich &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have too much money, and that money is fleeing stocks and collectibles and cryptos. Where's it going? Housing.

In this interview with Saker, Michael Hudson discusses the coming tsunami of real-estate inflation, in which the suckers who lost everything to the other bubbles go bankrupt and lose their homes to "investors" who plan to securitize a stream of rents from immiserated tenants.

&lt;a href="http://thesaker.is/the-saker-interviews-michael-hudson-4/"&gt;http://thesaker.is/the-saker-interviews-michael-hudson-4/&lt;/a&gt;

"Inflation" is the topic &lt;em&gt;du jour&lt;/em&gt;, wielded primarily as a whip to drive us to austerity. Most of the time, "inflation" is code for "regular people have too much money and we need to take some of it away" - by reducing benefits and suppressing wages.

It's 100% true that &lt;em&gt;asset&lt;/em&gt; inflation is being driven by too much money chasing too few goods - the money in this case is the capital gains of the investor class and the "goods" are productive businesses with growth potential. Thus we see investors flocking to pyramid schemes and destructive strip-miners whose "growth" comes from looting good businesses and discarding their husks.

But do regular people really have too much money? Are we all just trying to buy too many vegetables from farmers, too much paper from pulp mills, too many carbon-steel bike-frames from Chinese factories?

That proposition is a lot muddier. Sure, there are supply shocks due to covid's impact on the over-optimized, brittle supply chains the finance sector has demanded of real businesses. But there's also obvious monopolies and oligopolies, whose CEOs are openly touting their ability to raise prices under cover of the pandemic.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering&lt;/a&gt;

The more we tell the story of "too many working people's dollars chasing not enough goods," the more we empower monopolists to increase their margins and jack up prices. As Hudson says, "For meat, eggs and other farm produce, the farmers are not receiving higher prices for their crops and produce. The middlemen are gouging out more fees for themselves, thanks to the monopoly position of Cargill et al."

Not all price-gouging is created equal. Wealthy, empowered consumers are able to shop more widely, and when they catch monopolists at their profiteering, they have the ears of policy-makers. If you are a monopolist looking to really ratchet up prices, your safest bet is to pick on poor people, who have fewer retail options and less political cachet.

That's something that Jack Munroe has made clear with her new "Vimes Boot Index" (inspired by Terry Pratchett's character Sam Vimes, who ruminates on how replacing cheap boots costs more than buying one long-lasting but expensive pair, creating a tax on poverty).

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/26/terry-pratchett-jack-monroe-vimes-boots-poverty-index"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/26/terry-pratchett-jack-monroe-vimes-boots-poverty-index&lt;/a&gt;

Monroe's project started with a viral tweet complaining that the official UK inflation figures pegged inflation at 5%, but that this did not reflect the massive price-hikes on the very cheapest food at the supermarket.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BootstrapCook/status/1483778776697909252"&gt;https://twitter.com/BootstrapCook/status/1483778776697909252&lt;/a&gt;

Monroe cites triple-digit inflation on goods like pasta, rice, baked beans, peanut butter, etc. This week on the BBC's More or Less podcast, Tim Harford and Monroe take a closer look at the index:

&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0bk8lmz"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0bk8lmz&lt;/a&gt;

Neither offers a theory of why price inflation is hitting the cheapest goods so much harder than the most expensive, but I think the answer lies in political economy: it's safer to abuse poor people than rich people, and monopolists know it.

&lt;img alt="A 'thin blue line' flag but instead of a blue line, you can see the top of a greasy pepperoni pizza." src="https://craphound.com/images/pizzaflag.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Cops' imaginary fears send addicts to real jail (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/27/extraordinary-popular-delusions/#onshore-havana-syndrome"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Despite what you may have heard, cops have a relatively safe job. Cops are injured and killed with less frequency than roofers, truckers, fishermen, and pizza-delivery people. Cops are basically armed bureaucrats and their primary role is to file reports about crimes, not intervene in dangerous situations.

&lt;a href="https://scapimag.com/2021/01/08/the-thin-bread-line-why-being-a-delivery-driver-is-more-dangerous-than-being-a-cop/"&gt;https://scapimag.com/2021/01/08/the-thin-bread-line-why-being-a-delivery-driver-is-more-dangerous-than-being-a-cop/&lt;/a&gt;

Now, you may have heard that cop deaths are way, way, &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; up over the past two years. That is actually true - cops have been slain in unprecedented numbers since the pandemic began. Nearly all those deaths are the result of catching covid. Naturally, police unions (which are not actually unions) are fighting tooth-and-nail against vaccine and mask requirements for cops.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/us/police-covid-vaccines.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/us/police-covid-vaccines.html&lt;/a&gt;

(You've heard of "suicide by cop?" This is "suicide by cop union.")

The rhetoric about the dangerous life of a cop doesn't merely serve to make cops feel romantic about their form-filling and rule-enforcing. It's the foundation of the narrative that makes it okay for police officers to murder people suspected of minor crimes using overwhelming, unjustifiable force: that force is hand-waved away as the inevitable result of the daily terror of being a cop on the mean, mean streets.

The latest mutation of this mean-streets story is the nonsensical claims that police officers are in daily risk of dying because they might be touched by someone experiencing a fentanyl overdose, and, in so doing, absorb a fatal dose of fentanyl through their fingertips.

This isn't a thing. There's a reason fentanyl users snort it and inject it, rather than rubbing it between their fingers.

It's not a thing when the Sacramento Bee reports it:

&lt;a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article253325223.html"&gt;https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article253325223.html&lt;/a&gt;

It's not a thing when CNN reports it:

&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/16/health/police-fentanyl-overdose-trnd/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/16/health/police-fentanyl-overdose-trnd/index.html&lt;/a&gt;

Now, looking at these reports, it seems that some cops actually believe they have been poisoned (either that or they're putting on quite a show). That doesn't make it real. History is full of extraordinary popular delusions, imaginary diseases spread by social contagion.

The delusional belief in fentanyl overdose by contact high doesn't just hurt impressionable cops who scare themselves into flopping around on the ground, moaning. That's because those same cops then go on to charge people who experience fentanyl overdose with &lt;em&gt;assaulting an officer&lt;/em&gt; by means of their imaginary Opiod Death-Touch.

&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/police-overdosing-touching-fentanyl-experts-152505198.html"&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/news/police-overdosing-touching-fentanyl-experts-152505198.html&lt;/a&gt;

These additional charges are adding &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; to the sentences of people experiencing addiction or just those guilty of simple possession. This despite the fact that the DEA has revised its guidance and now admits that there's no serious risk of fentanyl skin absorbtion:

The myth is all-pervasive in cop circles and has spread to other first responders, with many now hesitating to resuscitate people in overdose. 80% of NYC first responders now believe in skin-penetrating fentanyl:

&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/abs/pilot-study-on-risk-perceptions-and-knowledge-of-fentanyl-exposure-among-new-york-state-first-responders/E60DAF91D53FFA31321C35646135BCBD"&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/abs/pilot-study-on-risk-perceptions-and-knowledge-of-fentanyl-exposure-among-new-york-state-first-responders/E60DAF91D53FFA31321C35646135BCBD&lt;/a&gt;

As Tim Cushing writes for Techdirt, this delusion is so strong because "courts and lawmakers cut cops all sorts of slack under the assumption that cops should be given every opportunity to be wrong."

&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20220109/18122748258/cops-new-favorite-junk-science-is-pretending-being-anywhere-near-fentanyl-will-literally-cause-them-to-die.shtml"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20220109/18122748258/cops-new-favorite-junk-science-is-pretending-being-anywhere-near-fentanyl-will-literally-cause-them-to-die.shtml&lt;/a&gt;

It's true that cops experience some danger on the job - just not as much as the pizza-delivery person who dropped off your pepperoni pie yesterday.

&lt;h1&gt;Pixels of You (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/08/wall-street-landlords/#young-doyler"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Pixels of You&lt;/em&gt; is a new young adult sf graphic novel, written by Ananth Hirsh and Yuko Ota and illustrated by Jenn Doyle, published today by Abrams. It's a sweet, smart tale of art, bitterness, enmity and camaraderie.

&lt;a href="https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/pixels-of-you_9781419749575/"&gt;https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/pixels-of-you_9781419749575/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Pixels'&lt;/em&gt; two protagonists are a pair of young women who have both won a coveted spot at an upscale photography gallery.

Indira is the survivor of a wreck that orphaned her and led to one of her eyes being replaced with a digital camera; Fawn is a human-presenting AI whose robot "parents" sacrificed all to give her a skinsuit that lets her pass as a human.

They begin the tale as rivals but when their bickering frustrates the gallery's mercurial owner, she orders them to collaborate on a graduate project, threatening to end their nascent art careers if they fail to produce work of merit.

It's a fantastic setup for a buddy story, one where the irreconcilable is reconciled, where hate flips to love and back again, and where art is debated, created, destroyed and finally remade.

Graphic novels are (unsurprisingly) great vehicles for stories about art. While painterly novels like Chaim Potok's &lt;em&gt;My Name is Asher Lev&lt;/em&gt; and Steven Brust's &lt;em&gt;The Sun, The Moon and the Stars&lt;/em&gt; must approximate the visual with the literary, comics can skip that step entirely.

It's partly why Scott McCloud's &lt;em&gt;Understanding Comics&lt;/em&gt; remains a classic: using the visual to illustrate the visual is a natural and powerful technique. It's also why Disney's &lt;em&gt;Looking at Paintings&lt;/em&gt; is such a superb book on art theory.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2010/01/18/disneys-looking-at-paintings-an-introduction-to-fine-art-for-young-people/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2010/01/18/disneys-looking-at-paintings-an-introduction-to-fine-art-for-young-people/&lt;/a&gt;

Comics aren't limited to tales of visual art; it's a great medium for any tale of art and artistry. Think of Cecil Castellucci's memoir &lt;em&gt;Girl on Film&lt;/em&gt;, variously a meditation on film, writing, rock-and-rolling, and the neurological basis for memory formation.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/11/19/girl-on-film-a-graphic-novel-memoir-of-a-life-in-the-arts-and-the-biological-basis-for-memory-formation/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2019/11/19/girl-on-film-a-graphic-novel-memoir-of-a-life-in-the-arts-and-the-biological-basis-for-memory-formation/&lt;/a&gt;

But comics about great visual art also present a unique challenge: while writers need not paint a great painting in order to evoke such a painting, a comic about great photography must feature images of great, striking photos.

Here's where Doyle's work really shines. Their work captures lively posture and body language, and their composition evokes both the careful work of a carefully planned landscape and the lucky accidents of the perfect from-the-hip snap.

You may be familiar with Doyle's work from their longrunning, successful crowdfunded series Knights-Errant. If so, you'll recognize their gift for character design and highly expressive, wordless panels.

I read my advance copy of &lt;em&gt;Pixels of You&lt;/em&gt; with special interest, because Doyle and I are collaborating on a graphic novel adaptation of my novella &lt;em&gt;Unauthorized Bread&lt;/em&gt;, which First Second is publishing.

&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/&lt;/a&gt;

I was already excited about working with Doyle based on their solo work, but &lt;em&gt;Pixels&lt;/em&gt; only increased my delight at the prospect of working on a book length project with them.

&lt;img alt="A rotting apartment living room; the Wall Street 'Charging Bull' statue is in one corner; from one of its horns dangles a sign reading 'FOR RENT WALL ST.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/wall-st-landlords.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wall Street's landlord business is turning every rental into a slum (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/08/wall-street-landlords/#the-new-slumlords"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Shelter is a human right and a necessity for human thriving. The choice to turn speculation on our homes into a path to social mobility inevitably led to the crash of 2008 and 3.7 million US foreclosures.

&lt;a href="https://gen.medium.com/the-rents-too-damned-high-520f958d5ec5"&gt;https://gen.medium.com/the-rents-too-damned-high-520f958d5ec5&lt;/a&gt;

In the Great Financial Crisis, the Obama administration chose to bail out banks, rather than borrowers, giving them the capital they needed to start buying those foreclosed homes in bulk. This was only accelerated by the Trump covid bailout, which sent trillions into the finance industry.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/27/extraordinary-popular-delusions/#wall-street-slumlords"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/27/extraordinary-popular-delusions/#wall-street-slumlords&lt;/a&gt;

Wall Street landlords are the worst landlords. For years, the press has been documenting the Wall Street landlord playbook: deep cuts to maintenance that leave homes all but uninhabitable; scorching rent-hikes; and mass evictions any time a tenant balks at either measure.

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2018/07/30/wall-street-landlords-are-slumlords/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2018/07/30/wall-street-landlords-are-slumlords/&lt;/a&gt;

Wall Street landlords are extracting never-seen levels of profit from their "investments" in our homes; some of that money is being laundered into policy that makes it possible for them to extract even higher profits. That's the "political" in "political economy": profits are turned into policy, policy increases profits.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/03/liquidation-preference/#sweet-sweet-corruption"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/03/liquidation-preference/#sweet-sweet-corruption&lt;/a&gt;

The Wall Street landlord lobby has spent many of the millions it extracted from tenants to make those tenants' lives worse - making eviction easier, getting rid of rent controls. All this in addition to the existing landlord's leverage: "Do as I say, or live in a cardboard box."

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/02/innovation-unlocks-markets/#digital-arm-breakers"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/02/innovation-unlocks-markets/#digital-arm-breakers&lt;/a&gt;

Much of the reporting on Wall Street landlords has focused on single-family homes (including my own). But today on Propublica, Heather Vogell gives us a deeply reported, enraging look at how private equity slumlords are using public money to buy up and destroy apartment buildings, at great profit.

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/when-private-equity-becomes-your-landlord"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/when-private-equity-becomes-your-landlord&lt;/a&gt;

There are many kinds of Wall Street landlord; the sector is dominated by Real-Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), a favored vehicle for offshore money-laundering, especially popular among foreign kleptocrats who smuggle their loot out of their homelands:

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/06/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-money-laundering-but-were-afraid-to-ask/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/06/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-money-laundering-but-were-afraid-to-ask/&lt;/a&gt;

But as bad as REITs are, they still make better landlords than private equity companies. Unlike REITs, which are an ongoing concern, PE funds close out every ten years or so and have to realize all their profits before they do. This turns PE into industrial-scale house-flippers, obsessed by short-term gains without any regard for the long-term consequences.

PE giants aren't just buying up single-family homes; they're buying apartment buildings at an incredible rate, in deals that involve both individual buildings and taking over REITs and their entire portfolios. These are &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt; profitable investments: while REITs generate 4.33% annually on their residential properties, PE companies squeeze &lt;em&gt;20%&lt;/em&gt; profits out of those same buildings.

That's a great deal, if you're part of the investor class with a share in the PE company. But if you're a tenant, those excessive profits are coming at your expense - at the cost of your living conditions and your pocketbook.

Start with your living conditions. Vogell uses San Francisco's Olume building - transferred from Monogram - an REIT - to Greystar in 2017 as an example. Under Greystar's management, the Olume went from a delightful place to live to a dangerous slum, even as rents skyrocketed.

Tenants whose appliances broke down were given replacements scrounged from empty units. Their broken units were never repaired, and when the replacements broke down they were replaced with the broken units the tenants had previously phoned in.

Eventually, Greystar stopped fixing appliances altogether. As the washing machines in Olume's apartments failed, Greystar directed tenants to wander the hallways, checking for unlocked, empty apartments with working machines.

Greystar cut way back on the Olume's trash collection and then failed to clean up the inevitable drifts of rotting garbage that collected in the hallways. The common spaces deteriorated due to lack of maintenance. Security was slashed and broken locks weren't replaced; strangers started to appear in the hallways and parking garage.

The city recorded waves of complaints against the Olume. Inspectors documented broken-down HVAC systems and, ominously, fire suppression systems.

Even as the Olume was rotting under neglect from its new PE owners, the cost of living in the Olume skyrocketed. One tenant's 535 sqft apartment went from $2,800 to $3,400. But this doesn't tell the whole story: Greystar followed the PE price-gouging playbook, finding all kinds of ways to squeeze its tenants - for example, the annual fee for keeping a pet in your apartment went up by 25%.

PE companies are notorious for these hidden fees, and for a tactic called "pyramiding," where fees stack up on fees, so that your effective rent goes up &lt;em&gt;every month&lt;/em&gt;.

All of this was great business for Greystar. Within two years, it had increased its annual profits on the Olume to $2,330,407 - a 24% increase over the previous owners' take.

Greystar is on a buying spree, but it's mostly not spending its investors' money. Rather, it is the beneficiary of enormous public subsidies in the form of low-interest loans from Freddie Mac, a company chartered by Congress and backed by the US government.

Freddie Mac has been firehosing money on private equity companies buying up apartment buildings: "Large private equity firms accounted for 85% of Freddie Mac’s 20 biggest deals financing apartment complex purchases by a single borrower." Just a handful of PE companies are the primary beneficiaries of $16b of Freddie Mac's largesse: Greystar, Lonestar, Starwood, Brookfield and Harbor Group.

This free money has helped restructure the American landlord industry. In 2015, just under half of America's apartment buildings were owned by individuals. Today, it's 41% - and falling.

Freddie Mac's mission is to promote "liquidity, stability and affordability to the housing market." But the "liquidity" part has trumped stability and affordability in its daily operations. Rather than, say, giving cheap loans to tenants who want to buy their buildings and turn them into nonprofit co-ops, Freddie Mac uses its government-backed loans to subsidize rent-gouging PE slumlords.

The cycle goes around and around: the profits from slumlording are turned into slumlord-favorable policies. Blackstone - one of the country's leading Wall Street slumlords - used $6.2m of its tenants' money to fight a 2018 California ballot rent control initiative. That victory let it continue to raise rents and amass an even larger warchest to fight for even worse conditions for tenants.

&lt;h1&gt;UK Tories want a national database of porn-viewing habits (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/08/wall-street-landlords/#operation-red-meat"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

UK PM Boris Johnson has built a career out of running across rivers on the backs of alligators, always moving fast enough that he escapes their jaws. His career is a long string of outrageous scandals: lying, fraud, infidelity, abuse, all escaped with impunity. Like any self-respecting posh sociopath, Boris knows how to fail up.

But eventually, even the nimblest of gator-racers loses a step and finds a set of jaws clamped around his leg. Boris is embroiled in a scandal - he ordered a national lockdown that meant that no one in the land, not even the Queen, was allowed to socialize, even as he presided over more than a dozen parties in his official residence.

In the grand scheme of awful things Boris has done, this barely rates, but it has managed to rile both the UK columnist class and the Tory base, thanks in no small part to Boris's own rivals in the Conservative party, who sense an opportunity to depose him and move into the PM's flat.

In a desperate bid to save his political life, Boris has deployed Operation Red Meat, a series of stupid, unworkable and performatively cruel measures to distract from his scandal. Operation Red Meat's policies include defunding the BBC, ending all covid restrictions, campaigning against cryptography, using the military to block small migrant boats and other clickbait/culture war bullshit.

&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/boris-johnson-prime-minister-michael-gove-government-conservative-b1994555.html"&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/boris-johnson-prime-minister-michael-gove-government-conservative-b1994555.html&lt;/a&gt;

Many of Operation Red Meat's bad ideas are re-runs - policies that have already been floated and defeated, policies that would be a catastrophe if they were ever realized. That doesn't mean they won't be realized, though: Boris's support for Brexit was pure, insincere opportunism, but he still backed it.

Here's another moldy-oldie that Boris has dusted off for his distraction campaign: a plan to compile a database of the pornography preferences of every person in the UK, cross-referenced to that person's finances.

&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60293057"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60293057&lt;/a&gt;

Of course, that's not how the Tories are selling it. They're calling it an "age-verification system" for online pornography. But to make this "age-verification" work, you will have to provide a credit-card or passport to the site, or a third party. These sites will make all kinds of claims about how they will protect your privacy. These claims are bullshit. They will deliberately or inadvertently keep all that stuff on file, and then they will leak it or get hacked. If the NSA and MI5 can't prevent leaks, neither can Pornhub.

And when they do, they will expose the porn-viewing habits of every Briton, along with their financial details. It's a kompromat bonanza.

This idiotic plan has been repeatedly defeated in the UK. I don't actually think the people advocating for it want it to pass - they just want the distraction. But remember, that was also the basis for the establishment support for Brexit - and then the UK got Brexit. The fact that this isn't serious doesn't mean it won't happen.

&lt;img alt="A screenshot from the 'McKinsey for Kids' website. It shows a woman in a suit. The caption reads 'An economist at McKinsey tells a company how it might improve its business and profits over the next five, ten, or even 20 years. You might like this job if you’re interested in how money is made and spent. In this example, an economist realized that farmers struggled to know how much food they should buy.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/mckinseyforkids.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;McKinsey For Kids (no, really) (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/15/management-jesuits/#pmc-jr"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

McKinsey for Kids is a new website from the scandal-haunted consulting giants who proposed that Oxycontin-producers Purdue Pharma pay a bounty to pharma distributors based on the number of lethal overdoses in their territories. Its purpose is to teach kids to think like McKinsey Consultants.

&lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-for-kids/hungry-fish-baffled-farmers-and-what-happened-next"&gt;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-for-kids/hungry-fish-baffled-farmers-and-what-happened-next&lt;/a&gt;

"Chapter 1" of the project invites kids to manage an aquaponics fishery with "models" and "Internet of Things" gadgets and "computer vision." The lesson is long on the ways that outside experts can solve problems, and absolutely silent on the ways that outside experts can get it wrong. In that regard, it's a brilliant encapsulation of the McKinsey model (all that's missing are the titanic invoices).

Writing about McKinsey For Kids, &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;'s Adam M Lowenstein calls the site part of McKinsey's "thought leadership" program: "[a means to] project expertise and credibility, and to sustain the company’s narrative of itself and the work it does."

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/power/mckinsey-for-kids-insidious-tool-kit-spreading-corporate-influence/"&gt;https://prospect.org/power/mckinsey-for-kids-insidious-tool-kit-spreading-corporate-influence/&lt;/a&gt;

But McKinsey for Kids isn't just directed at the outside world; there's also an inside game: the site "reassure[s] current employees that the work they do is meaningful and purpose-driven, and to convince future employees that the way to live a meaningful and purpose-driven life is to go not into government, education, health care, or philanthropy, but into business. Somewhere like McKinsey."

That's an important challenge, because McKinsey's business relies on fielding plausible experts that will maintain its role as consigliere to 90 of the 100 largest businesses in the world. But McKinsey itself is such a force for ill that it keeps losing top personnel. Some - like Anand Giridharadas, go on to write bestsellers that eviscerate its claims to virtue:

&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2018/11/10/winners-take-all-modern-philanthropy-means-that-giving-some-away-is-more-important-than-how-you-got-it/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2018/11/10/winners-take-all-modern-philanthropy-means-that-giving-some-away-is-more-important-than-how-you-got-it/&lt;/a&gt;

It's hard to retain good people when your corporate mission helps ICE build freezing immigrant detention cages where prisoners are separated from their children and kept on the brink of starvation:

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/mckinsey-ICE-immigration.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/mckinsey-ICE-immigration.html&lt;/a&gt;

It's even harder when your corporate mission includes helping the Saudi royals identify dissidents and "neutralize" them:

&lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/exiled-saudi-dissident-sues-mckinsey-us-outing-him-mbs-1568226"&gt;https://www.newsweek.com/exiled-saudi-dissident-sues-mckinsey-us-outing-him-mbs-1568226&lt;/a&gt;

And as Lowenstein writes, McKinsey For Kids talks a good game about the company's role in addressing the climate emergency, but its meat-and-potatoes is work for Exoon, BP, and Saudi Aramco:

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/business/mckinsey-climate-change.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/business/mckinsey-climate-change.html&lt;/a&gt;

The company is &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt; at this kind of thought-leadership-projection. Its utterly banal, useless "Beyond Coronavirus: The Path to the Next Normal" has been cited 65 times, including many citations in peer-reviewed journals (the reviewers apparently failed to read the article):

&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9731384302586895627&amp;amp;amp;as_sdt=20005&amp;amp;amp;sciodt=0,9&amp;amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9731384302586895627&amp;amp;amp;as_sdt=20005&amp;amp;amp;sciodt=0,9&amp;amp;amp;hl=en&lt;/a&gt;

The foundational message of McKinsey for Kids is identical to the message of McKinsey itself: to save capitalism, we must capitalism harder. The problems of markets must be solved with markets. The problems of business are best addressed by founding a rival business.

McKinsey's built a powerful botnet: its alumni are woven through government, business and finance. These alums work with their former colleagues to create "efficiencies" that are realized through job cuts, pay cuts, informalization, regulatory arbitrage and mergers to monopoly.

McKinsey For Kids is part of the strategy that maintains the power of that botnet and replenishes its personnel.

&lt;a name="spats"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="A product shot of Apple's Airtag; superimosed on it in meme-style all-caps Impact is 'SNITCHES GET STITCHES.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/bleleaks.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Outing German spy agencies by mailing them Airtags (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/15/management-jesuits/#spats"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Apple's Airtags are an ingenious technology: they fuse every Ios device into a sensor grid that logs the location of each tag, using clever cryptography to prevent anyone but the tag's owner from pulling that information out of the system.

But there are significant problems with Airtags' privacy model. Some of these are unique to Apple, others are shared by all Bluetooth location systems, including Covid exposure-notification apps and Airtag rivals like Tile.

For example, minute imperfections in these devices' Bluetooth radio circuitry make it possible to uniquely identify them without having to bypass their encryption, simply by tracking the signature "fingerprint" of each radio:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/21/sidechannels/#ble-eding"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/21/sidechannels/#ble-eding&lt;/a&gt;

That's an attack on the device's owner. But tracker tags also enable attacks &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; the device's owner. For example, there's a thriving market for Airtags whose speakers have been disabled (the speakers emit a chirp that is supposed to warn people if they are being tracked by someone else's Airtag):

&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/03/airtags-with-deactivated-speakers-being-sold/"&gt;https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/03/airtags-with-deactivated-speakers-being-sold/&lt;/a&gt;

Even without gimmicked speakers, tracking people with Airtags (and their competitors) is frighteningly easy. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;' Kashmir Hill (consensually) tracked her husband around Manhattan with a constellation of these bugs.

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/technology/airtags-gps-surveillance.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/technology/airtags-gps-surveillance.html&lt;/a&gt;

Even with the chirping speakers, her husband - a press privacy advocate with a strong technical background - struggled to locate and de-activate the Airtags. Hill reports that many people - particularly women - are finding Airtags hidden in their cars, clothes and elsewhere.

The far-reaching surveillance potential of these trackers was driven home by a stunt/investigation carried out by Lilith Wittmann, who confirmed her suspicion that a German government agency was a front for a spy operation, by mailing Airtag-bugged packages to it and watching as they were relayed to facilities used by the intelligence services ("the Office for the Protection of the Constitution").

&lt;a href="https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/bundesservice-telekommunikation-enttarnt-dieser-geheimdienst-steckt-dahinter-cd2e2753d7ca"&gt;https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/bundesservice-telekommunikation-enttarnt-dieser-geheimdienst-steckt-dahinter-cd2e2753d7ca&lt;/a&gt;

It's a fascinating new operational security wrinkle that relies on the popularity and ubiquity of Apple's Ios devices; foiling it requires not just that a spy facility be mobile-phone-free, but that all the facilities that deliver its mail also adopt this measure.

&lt;h1&gt;Amazon's $31b "ad business" isn't (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/27/not-an-ad/#shakedowns"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Looking at Amazon's quarterly financials, it would be easy to mistake the company's $31b ad division as a serious shift in the online advertising industry, but that would be a huge mistake. You see, Amazon's not really selling &lt;em&gt;ads&lt;/em&gt;.

Nearly all of that $31b is for an "ad" &lt;em&gt;on Amazon itself&lt;/em&gt;: that is it's Amazon collecting billions from the sellers who rely on the company as their main retail channel, who are locked in a bidding war to buy the top spots in search and product pages.

This is a huge shift for Amazon in every way. In 2015, the company was booking $1b in annual ad revenue. The explosive growth of ad revenue was accompanied by an increasing presence of third-party Amazon Marketplace sellers: 3% in 2000, 60% today.

But just as significant is the shift in how Amazon presents its merchandise. As Marketplace Pulse succinctly put it, "Everything on Amazon is an Ad."

&lt;a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/everything-on-amazon-is-an-ad"&gt;https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/everything-on-amazon-is-an-ad&lt;/a&gt;

In a search result, the first 3-7 thumbnails are "sponsored results." On a product page the top bar, the bottom third, and large swathes of the right bar and main body are for sale.

To make this clear: Amazon retail business today is as an intermediary, a chokepoint capitalist marketplace with customers corralled on one side and merchants on the other, with a gate in between where it collects rent to let one side talk to other.

Amazon calls itself "Earth's most customer-centric company," a slogan that pits the people who rely on Amazon for goods against the sellers who provide those goods, the warehouse workers who pack the goods, and the delivery drivers who drop off the goods. Sure, Amazon says, your conscience might twinge for the small business people squeezed by Amazon, or the workers being maimed in the warehouses or peeing in bottles in their vans. But we do it all for you: we have figured out how to match you with the things you need at the best price.

But Amazon's ad business - the third-largest ad business in the world - is the opposite of a "customer-centric" business. As Trung Phan reminds us, Amazon launched with a much-vaunted "collaborative filter" whose recommendations were driven by users, not sellers:

&lt;a href="https://trungphan.substack.com/p/amazons-31b-ad-business-explained"&gt;https://trungphan.substack.com/p/amazons-31b-ad-business-explained&lt;/a&gt;

In its seminal paper on the system, Amazon promised a store that "radically changes based on customer interests":

&lt;a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf"&gt;https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

Remember when Amazon's screen real estate was given over to "Customers who bought this also bought this" and  "Customers who viewed also viewed"? Today those slots are filled with "Sponsored products related to" and "Brands related to this category."

In other words, Amazon has converted its "customer-centric" personalization system, which emphasized the products it predicted you would like best, into an auction house, where the products that have paid the most come first.

Amazon sellers - 60% of the platform and rising - have to choose whether to spend their money on better products or better placement on Amazon. If they choose better products, you'll never find them. Amazon made $32b last year contributing to the crapification of everything it sold.

No wonder that Amazon Marketplace is being gobbled up by "gators" - Amazon aggregators who raised billions in the capital markets to buy out independent sellers, rolling them up into deep-pocketed conglomerates.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/10/monopoly-begets-monopoly/#gator-ade"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/10/monopoly-begets-monopoly/#gator-ade&lt;/a&gt;

Gators are like miniature Amazons: markets where success is based on capital, not quality. They are systems for multiplying investor cash, not by making better products at better prices, but by outmaneuvering smaller rivals who can't afford to bribe Amazon to give them pride of place.

As an employee at Thrasio, a $10b gator, told Krista Brown for &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;: "I cannot imagine being an individual seller."

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/power/rollups-gators-defining-the-merchant-makeover/"&gt;https://prospect.org/power/rollups-gators-defining-the-merchant-makeover/&lt;/a&gt;

There is one major seller that is immune from this arms-race to buy your business from Amazon: Amazon itself. Amazon's own-brand business - which data-mines its business customers' sales data, manufacturing information, and other commercial intel, and then knocks them off - doesn't have to buy the top of the page. Amazon's own products get those slots for free.

Which means that Amazon has tied a $32b anchor around its sellers' necks, then asked them to compete with its knockoffs of their products by outbidding them in search- and product-pages, on which Amazon can top any third-party bid by writing an unlimited check to itself.

Amazon became Amazon because of extremely specific, explicit political choices that were made by a string of US administrations, starting with Ronald Reagan and ending with Donald Trump.

As Lina Khan wrote in her seminal "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," the "consumer welfare" theory of antitrust that Reagan ushered in required regulators to tolerate any monopolistic behavior, no matter how egregious, so long as it resulted in "consumer benefits" (lower prices and/or better products):

&lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox&lt;/a&gt;

Under this theory, Amazon was able to use predatory pricing, abusive labor practices, and anticompetitive acquisitions to corner markets, so long as it could claim to be "Earth's most customer-centric company."

But the "consumer welfare" benefits of monopolies are inevitably fleeting. Amazon's "customer-centrism" was and is a tactic, not a goal. The goal is maximizing profits. If "customer-centrism" - in the form of abuse of workers and suppliers to secure lower prices - brings in our business, Amazon will do that. But once Amazon locks us in - say, by convincing us to buy a subscription to its products in the form of a Prime "membership" - that "customer-centrism" takes a back seat to revenue extraction.

Prime isn't merely a tool for locking is customers - it's every bit as much a tool for locking in sellers. Being a Prime seller is a prerequisite for scoring high on search results. To be a Prime seller, you have to hand over 45% of your revenues to Amazon, and pledge not to sell more cheaply anywhere else.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/01/you-are-here/#prime-facie"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/01/you-are-here/#prime-facie&lt;/a&gt;

That means that anyone serious about selling on Amazon is a Prime seller, and therefore has to charge extra in order to avoid losing money on every Amazon sale. That higher Amazon price becomes the universal price, thanks to Amazon's most-favored-nation status. In other words, Amazon has figured out how to raise prices not just for its own customers, but for all of its rivals' customers, too.

&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/amazon-primes-free-shipping-promise"&gt;https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/amazon-primes-free-shipping-promise&lt;/a&gt;

Every now and again, there will be a "fake Amazon review" scandal, in which we learn that billions are changing hands behind the scenes to "inauthentically" boost inferior products to the top of Amazon search results:

&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/features/amazons-never-ending-fake-reviews-problem-explained/"&gt;https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/features/amazons-never-ending-fake-reviews-problem-explained/&lt;/a&gt;

But "fake reviews" are just an end run around Amazon's own $32b payola racket. If Amazon was serious about being "Earth's most customer-centric company," search results would be determined by predictions about the suitability of merchandise, not the vendor's ability to buy the top of the page.

Which isn't to say that fake reviews aren't a problem. They really are, especially in light of Amazon's pivot to selling recommendations to the highest bidder. Customers who understand that Amazon's search results are a game of moneyball (not a merit-based sorting) use those reviews as means of sorting the wealthy from the useful, relying on 5-star counts to guess at the best products.

But with Amazon selling search-results and sleazy fake-ad peddlers selling reviews, there's no reliable way to sort the good from the bad. "Earth's most customer-centric company" has captured the market, raised prices, lowered quality, and clobbered independents, all while pitting shoppers against workers.

The ad-tech market is a hive of scum and villainy, but Amazon's version of ads - payola - is an entirely separate industry, with its own multitude of sins.

&lt;h1&gt;How "hollowed" hotels are destroying worker rights (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/01/reit-modernization-act/#reit-makes-might"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The Real Estate Investment Trust is (REIT) a sixties-era tax shelter designed to allow mom-and-pop investors to buy into income properties. REITs are exempt from corporate tax, but they're also prohibited from managing the buildings they own.

Banning REITs from management roles was supposed to scare off rich people looking for a tax break and keep REITs firmly in the realm of the "little guy." But as with any tax-shelter, the super-rich used REITs as a wedge to create a parallel system of property ownership and taxation reserved for plutocrats.

REITs offer many benefits to the ultra-rich beyond their tax-exempt status. They offer a highly anonymized vehicle for offshore money-laundering. Billions in oligarch wealth has been converted to tax-free ownership of American commercial real-estate, cleaned, and remobilized as bribes, yachts and cryptos.

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CZEdwards/status/1213597148274511872"&gt;https://twitter.com/CZEdwards/status/1213597148274511872&lt;/a&gt;

Not all of that offshore money is truly offshore, of course: when an American oligarch parks his cash on a treasure island, he doesn't spend it there. There's nothing to buy in the BVI or Gibraltar. That money is sent back to America, anonymized, tax-free, and turned into real-estate via REITs.

(Though of course, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of that overseas oligarch cash comes from actual overseas oligarchs; post-Crimea invasion, REITs were a handy way for Russian oligarchs to beat US sanctions)

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CZEdwards/status/1213611855244972033"&gt;https://twitter.com/CZEdwards/status/1213611855244972033&lt;/a&gt;

Now, recall that REITs have a poison pill: an REIT is allowed to own real-estate, but not manage it. In 1999, hospitality industry lobbyists successfully pushed through the REIT Modernization Act, which effectively ended this stricture. Under the new law, the REIT can incorporate a wholly owned subsidiary, a "taxable REIT subsidiary corporation" (TRS) which can manage the operations of hospitality businesses like hotels.

You may have noticed the word "taxable" in "taxable REIT subsidiary corporation." Unlike an REIT, a TRS's profits are subject to taxation. But that's easily evaded: just have the leasing fee the TRS pays to its parent REIT represent 100% of the profits of the hotel it's managing. Now the TRS makes no profits, and the REIT makes all the profits, and the REIT is tax-exempt.

The pandemic supercharged all forms of financial crime, and TRS scams are no exception. As Daniel Boguslaw writes for &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, hotel REITs have found a way to smash their workers' unions, and they're using public money to do it.

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/labor/predatory-hotel-investment-trusts-decimating-workers-rights-democrats-loyal-unions/"&gt;https://prospect.org/labor/predatory-hotel-investment-trusts-decimating-workers-rights-democrats-loyal-unions/&lt;/a&gt;

Remember when it looked like all commercial real-estate would collapse, and when the entire tourist industry trembled on the brink of destruction?

The crisis was averted thanks to billions in public subsidy sent to hotels and other businesses, many of them owned by tax-exempt REITs.

The big, name-brand hotels in large US cities are mostly "hollow" - Hiltons and Marriotts who've sold their names to TRSes who remit all the profits to REITs. As Boguslaw puts it, "the TRS was the perfect tool for parasitic investors to suck out profits from the marrow of hospitality firms, leaving brand-name hotels hollowed out and largely controlled by the burrowing REIT."

Hotel work was hard before the pandemic, but at least hotel employees were unionized. Hotel REITs used the pandemic as a pretext to attack these workers. As hotel REIT DiamondRock CEO Mark Brugger told his shareholders, "Never waste a good crisis as they say. We are doing things that we’ve never done before. We’ve combined jobs we’ve never combined before. We’re running at efficiency levels on low occupancy we’ve never done before."

&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4386659-diamondrock-hospitality-company-drh-ceo-mark-brugger-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call"&gt;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4386659-diamondrock-hospitality-company-drh-ceo-mark-brugger-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call&lt;/a&gt;

He's not alone. Here's RLJ Lodging Trust CEO Leslie Hale: "We’re pretty confident based on the way that we’re operating today and the occupancies that we’re running and efficiencies that we’ve learned that we will not have to go back to 2019 levels of labor."

&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4446164-rlj-lodging-trusts-rlj-ceo-leslie-hale-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4446164-rlj-lodging-trusts-rlj-ceo-leslie-hale-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript&lt;/a&gt;

What does that look like? Well Hawai'i's union hotels are at 90% pre-pandemic occupancy, but only 64% staffing. The hotels charge guests full price, but don't provide daily housekeeping. Even without daily room-cleaning, housekeepers are being worked to exhaustion: "They are letting workers suffer while hundreds are still waiting to have their jobs back" (Ruby Rubina, housekeeper, Hilton Hawaiian Village Honolulu).

Analysts love the sound of this. They're calling for a 40% staffing cut and a $5b cut to hospitality workers' wages:

&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2021/07/19/hotels-like-hilton-drop-daily-housekeeping-will-it-annoy-customers/?sh=4a9cfb147205"&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2021/07/19/hotels-like-hilton-drop-daily-housekeeping-will-it-annoy-customers/?sh=4a9cfb147205&lt;/a&gt;

Hotel execs are fully onboard. Park Hotels CEO Thomas Baltimore: "We have been talking with the union about opportunities to rightsize [the labor] model."

Remember, the entire basis for REITs owning hotels is a cheat, a way to let rich people take advantage of a tax-shelter created for "the little guy." It should come as no surprise that these same plutes are using other "little guy" tax breaks to hide billions.

The IRS Files from Propublica are full of revelations about REIT tycoons using the money they've saved by destroying the commercial real-estate sector to lobby for even more tax breaks.

REIT tycoon Steven Roth dropped $5m lobbying for a 20% tax rate on REIT earnings in the Trump tax bill. That deduction now nets him $5m &lt;em&gt;per year&lt;/em&gt; on dividends from his Vornado Realty Trust.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/11/the-canada-variant/#shitty-man-of-history-theory"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/11/the-canada-variant/#shitty-man-of-history-theory&lt;/a&gt;

Congress is (finally) taking (baby) steps to address this scam. In Senators Sherrod Brown and Mark Warner's letter to SEC chair Gary Gensler, they called for mandatory REIT transparency reports detailing the number of subcontractors and other non-payroll employees.

"We urge you to ensure that future SEC rulemaking captures this long-term trend of companies’ increasing use of outsourcing, independent contractors, and subcontracting, which will be a critical data point in understanding companies’ human capital management."

That's a small start, but at least it would get some facts into evidence. A meatier proposal comes froom Americans for Tax Fairness, who've called on the IRS to close the "loophole that allows REITs to consolidate profits to a small handful of shareholders."

&lt;a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/wp-content/uploads/ATF-Executive-Action-Options-for-President-Biden-on-Tax-Issues-FINAL-4-22-21.pdf"&gt;https://americansfortaxfairness.org/wp-content/uploads/ATF-Executive-Action-Options-for-President-Biden-on-Tax-Issues-FINAL-4-22-21.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

"This dodge allows a small group of wealthy taxpayers to enjoy all the tax advantages of a REIT without fulfilling the system’s original intent of opening up real estate investment to middle-income households."

Boguslaw closes his article by noting that the union that represents the majority of organized hotel workers is UNITE HERE, a key power-bloc for Democrats seeking re-election.

"Ordering the IRS and the SEC to enforce powers over predatory REITs is a good start on Biden reversing the trend of power flowing from unionized workers to profiteering vultures. Making a public commitment to the largely female, immigrant union workforce that helped him win his campaign would be even better."

&lt;h1&gt;Surprise billing's death-spiral may suck in untold patients (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/14/unhealthy-finances/#steins-law"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The most remarkable thing about the surprise billing crisis is that its architects thought they could get away with it. Back in 2018, KKR (slogan: "Integrity. Trust. Partnership") bought Envision Health with a plan to make billions through Emergency Room fraud.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/04/a-mind-forever-voyaging/#prop-bets"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/04/a-mind-forever-voyaging/#prop-bets&lt;/a&gt;

Here's how surprise billing works: a company like Envision convinces a hospital to let its emergency room doctors form a private company that doesn't take any insurance (especially not the insurance the hospital accepts). When gravely injured, seriously ill, unconscious and dying people present at the ER, they are tricked into signing paperwork saying they'll pay whatever Envision charges.

Now, the AMA bans non-doctors from owning medical practices, so nominally all of these private "doctors' groups" are run by ER doctors. The true owners, though, are private equity looters - you can tell, because whenever one of these "doctor-owners" objects to an inhumane practice, they're summarily fired:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/21/profitable-butchers/#looted"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/21/profitable-butchers/#looted&lt;/a&gt;

KKR's buyout of Envision followed the private equity playbook: buy a business, load it up with debt, pay the "investors" giant bonuses and management fees, cut wages and service, and raise prices. This left Envision with billions in debts, which it would have to make up by gouging dying people and impoverishing medical personnel.

And that's the amazing part: that KKR really believed that it could destroy the entire national emergency healthcare capacity of the United States of America without running into any kind of public policy response.

I mean, I understand how they came to that conclusion. America is, after all, a country willing to give billions in bailouts to private equity firms that had mismanaged emergency rooms into the ground:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/11/socialized-losses/#socialized-losses"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/11/socialized-losses/#socialized-losses&lt;/a&gt;

But over time, the stories of &lt;em&gt;fully insured&lt;/em&gt; sick and injured people who are financially ruined after going to an ER at a hospital that was &lt;em&gt;covered by their insurance&lt;/em&gt; became harder and harder to ignore.

Private equity even figured out how to gouge people who &lt;em&gt;weren't&lt;/em&gt; having medical emergencies or using their booby-trapped ERs. Take Caitlin Wells Salerno, who went into labor and went to the Poudre Valley Hospital in Ft Collins, CO. The hospital had locked all its doors except for the ER, meaning she had to pass through the ER to get to the maternity ward. The ER insisted on doing her intake, and "upcoded" her as a "Level 5 emergency" and stuck her with a $2,755 bill.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/27/crossing-a-line/#zero-fucks-given"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/27/crossing-a-line/#zero-fucks-given&lt;/a&gt;

Stein's Law predicts that "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop." Even by American standards, the idea that fully insured people can be financially ruined by surprise billing was a bridge too far.

Anti-surprise-billing legislation was introduced in Congress. The surprise billing companies (who'd slashed doctors' pay, claiming they were too broke to maintain a living wage) found millions to spend on astroturf campaigns insisting that surprise billing was &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for patients:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/21/all-in-it-together/#doctor-patient-unity"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/21/all-in-it-together/#doctor-patient-unity&lt;/a&gt;

(Even more amazing: surprise billing companies were able to scrape together vast fortunes for these campaigns &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; blowing billions on stock buybacks).

The campaign to establish surprise billing as a permanent fixture in American health-care was viciously fought:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/21/pluralist-a-daily-link-adose-21-feb-2020/#sickening"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/21/pluralist-a-daily-link-adose-21-feb-2020/#sickening&lt;/a&gt;

Top Democrats like Richie Neal emerged as easily bought cheerleaders for surprise billing, bravely sticking up for the right of private equity to destroy the lives of sick people:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/13/youre-still-the-product/#richie-neal"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/13/youre-still-the-product/#richie-neal&lt;/a&gt;

Despite all this, the No Surprises Act passed in December 2020 and the Biden administration ordered an end to surprise billing in July 2021:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/02/spoil-the-surprise/#surprise-billing"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/02/spoil-the-surprise/#surprise-billing&lt;/a&gt;

The Biden order was a far cry from perfect. It included an arbitration clause that denied patients and their insurers a day in court, though it did require arbitrators to start negotiations from the median in-network rates for disputed procedures.

Last month, a federal judge in Texas struck down this provision, allowing private equity-backed emergency rooms to insist that their hugely inflated prices were a fair starting point:

&lt;a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/texas-judge-strikes-down-part-surprise-billing-rule/619357/"&gt;https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/texas-judge-strikes-down-part-surprise-billing-rule/619357/&lt;/a&gt;

Despite this, the surprise billing industry is on the skids. As Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt write for &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, Envision Health is circling the drain. Its $5.3b first-lien term loan is now "in distressed-debt territory" at $0.73 on the dollar, and its unsecured debt is trading at $0.53/dollar.

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/health/envision-healthcare-hits-the-skids/"&gt;https://prospect.org/health/envision-healthcare-hits-the-skids/&lt;/a&gt;

The company narrowly avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $100m CARES Act bailout, but it is in serious trouble. That's long-run good news, because Envision is a fucking abomination, a predator that gorges on the sick and injured.

But as Appelbaum and Batt write, in the short term, it's even more bad news. Envision's debt deals allow it to transfer $2-2.5b in assets to an unrestricted subsidiary. This is the same structure that allowed PE-backed demolitions like Sears, J Crew and Nine West to create a "bad" company that held all the debts and a "good" company that held all the assets.

If that's the plan - and it looks like it, based on Envision's talks with looters like Apollo Global Management - then the company's next move is to slash its ERs even further, starving them of supplies and staff, and starving its medical personnel with rock-bottom wages.

This will make the care in those ERs even worse. It's life-threateningly terrible now, thanks to the punishing metrics that Envision illegally forces on its doctors:

&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doctors-sue-envision-healthcare-say-private-equity-backed-firm-shouldn-rcna9276"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doctors-sue-envision-healthcare-say-private-equity-backed-firm-shouldn-rcna9276&lt;/a&gt;

We already know what this looks like. When Carlyle bought and destroyed HCR ManorCare, it pocketed billions, laid off hundreds of nursing home employees, and turned its nursing homes into fatal nightmares:

&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/opioid-overdoses-bedsores-and-broken-bones-what-happened-when-a-private-equity-firm-sought-profits-in-caring-for-societys-most-vulnerable/2018/11/25/09089a4a-ed14-11e8-baac-2a674e91502b_story.html"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/opioid-overdoses-bedsores-and-broken-bones-what-happened-when-a-private-equity-firm-sought-profits-in-caring-for-societys-most-vulnerable/2018/11/25/09089a4a-ed14-11e8-baac-2a674e91502b_story.html&lt;/a&gt;

That's the trajectory of the ERs under Envision's (mis)management. It's going to get worse before it gets better.

&lt;img alt="A 'big brain' Talosian alien from 'The Cage,' the 1965 pilot for Star Trek: the original series; the alien's face has been replaced with Mark Zuckerberg's." src="https://craphound.com/images/structsep.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Podcasting "Vertically Challenged" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/14/unhealthy-finances/#structural-integration"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

This week on my podcast, I read "Vertically Challenged," my latest &lt;em&gt;Locus&lt;/em&gt; column, on the "vertical integration" of Big Tech firms, who have merged and acquired their way to dominance:

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2022/03/cory-doctorow-vertically-challenged/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2022/03/cory-doctorow-vertically-challenged/&lt;/a&gt;

While tech firms practice many kinds of vertical integration, the most important one is the business of &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; a platform and &lt;em&gt;competing&lt;/em&gt; on a platform. Platforms - app stores, ad markets, ecommerce - are "two-sided markets," with the platform company mediating between both buyer and seller.

These two-sided marketplaces are high-stakes commercial arenas whose games are refereed by the platform companies. They decide on search-rankings, service charges, and inclusion. A platform company's judgment is the difference between commercial success and failure. If you're banished to the bottom of a search-ranking or locked out of a low-priced commission tier, you will go bust while your rivals thrive.

And yet, platform &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; want the referee to make these calls: we want spam and dangerous products to be downranked or blocked, we want action on inauthentic reviews and counterfeits; we want the best products to be given advantages that make them easier to find and more successful.

This is where the platform companies' participation in their own marketplaces becomes an irresolvable conflict. When Amazon clones an independent sellers' products and offers their own version ahead of the original in search results, it may be because Amazon's copy is better - but it might just be because Amazon makes more money that way.

Likewise when Apple puts it own music player app ahead of a rival; or Google chooses its own products to display ads on; or Facebook surfaces its on-platform version of an article and buries the version on the open web. Maybe these "self-preferencing" choices are legitimate, based on neutral judgment about what's best for us - and maybe it's self-interested cheating.

There's a reason we don't let referees own one of the teams in the games they oversee - why we don't let judges hear cases involving their relatives, or let lawyers represent both sides of a lawsuit. Even if they are really good at their jobs and very sincere in their promise to be fair, these processes will never feel legitimate.

It's even harder when it comes to the kinds of judgments platforms make all the time. If you search Google for a video and it shows you a Youtube link instead of a Vimeo one, which one is "better"? Unless you have an annual pass to visit Plato's Cave, you'll struggle to come up with an impartial answer to this question.

This is a situation with historical precedent. For decades, antitrust regulators imposed something called "structural separation" on important companies like banks and railroads. Banks were banned from owning businesses, because these business would compete with the firms they made loans to. Railroads were banned from owning freight companies, because these would compete with their freight customers.

The premise of structural separation is that it's impossible to administer a rule requiring platforms to be fair. It's impossible to prove when they're cheating, and even more impossible to convince the losers of contests with their subsidiaries that the call was a fair one.

There are some easy structural separation calls for Big Tech: spin off AWS, Amazon Studios, Kindle and Audible into independent companies. Force Facebook to sell off its VR holdings, Whatsapp and Instagram. Tell Apple it can make apps or run an app store, but not both. Tell Google the same, and for good measure, split off its ad-tech, videos, and office suite. Do the same for Salesforce, Microsoft, and all the other platforms.

But as Ramsi Woodcock has argued, you can't ban &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; vertical integration. A company &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a vertical integration. An office supply company isn't a bookkeeping company or a janitorial company, but we wouldn't force it to buy janitorial and bookkeeping from other, standalone businesses.

That's a pretty good argument. If we let Amazon keep its ecommerce business, do we force it to sell off its warehouse business? That's a source of significant commercial advantage, after all.

As good as this argument is, I don't think the tech giants will make it. They don't want us to think too hard about which businesses they insource and which ones they outsource, because the tech firms use outsourcing to avoid responsibility for the activities that harm the rest of us.

Like, Amazon insists that it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; own a publisher, but it &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; own the last-mile delivery services whose quota-lashed drivers piss in bottles and kill themselves and others as they struggle to make their deliveries. Apple insists that it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; buy &lt;em&gt;90 companies per year&lt;/em&gt; but it can't &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; manufacture its own gadgets, which would let it police slave-labor conditions and suicides in its factories. Facebook insists it must buy every VR company, but can't operate its own moderation boiler-rooms, where overworked, traumatized poor people spend every hour God sends looking at beheading videos, child sex abuse materials, and livestreamed murders.

Whether it's Google, Microsoft or Salesforce, the functions of platform businesses that hurt the rest of us are never part of the vertical integration stack.

Which raises a curious possibility: maybe we need a doctrine of structural &lt;em&gt;integration&lt;/em&gt;, forcing companies to own (and assume liability) for the parts of their businesses whose failures impose huge costs on society.

&lt;img alt="An Adafruit ESPHole: an open-source hardware gadget the size of a matchbox with a small screen that reads 'ESPHole/Conn'ing to Aisleds.Net...OK!/IP addr: 192.168.1.33/Checking 7061 domains/283 Nahs!" src="https://craphound.com/images/feather_boards_esphole-6445.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Renegotiate the web "bargain" by blocking all ads (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/28/shut-yer-pi-hole/#largest-boycott-in-world-history"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Back in 2019, I wrote a case-study on ad- and tracker-blocking as part of EFF's series on adversarial interoperability (AKA "competitive compatibility" or comcom). My point was that the ad-tech industry says that it tracks you as part of a bargain: you trade away your privacy and get media in exchange, but that this was a bizarre kind of take-it-or-leave-it form of bargaining.

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah&lt;/a&gt;

The ad-tech deal boils down to this: "Just by following a link to this page, you have agreed to, well, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; we feel like doing. We can collect your data, sell it, merge it with other data, share it, mine it, exploit it. Forever."

That's not much of a bargain. Clearly the ad-tech companies don't take it very seriously - as Facebook's own privacy engineers have admitted in a leaked memo, they have &lt;em&gt;no idea&lt;/em&gt; how they're using your data (an FB engineer called the company's data-handling "a complete shitshow"), so how can this possibly be a fair trade?

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvmke/facebook-doesnt-know-what-it-does-with-your-data-or-where-it-goes"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvmke/facebook-doesnt-know-what-it-does-with-your-data-or-where-it-goes&lt;/a&gt;

I'm no free market stan, but I do think that bargaining can improve outcomes. That's where ad-block comes in: by blocking ads (or trackers, say, with EFF's Privacy Badger), the website makes an offer: "Give me everything," and you make a counter-offer: "How about 'Nah?'"

A couple weeks ago, the folks at Adafruit got in touch to tell me about a new privacy kit they were developing: the ESPHole, a variant on the PiHole privacy appliance. This is a matchbox-sized gadget based on the open source Raspberry Pi processor. You get it onto your home wifi and then tell all your devices to use it as their DNS server. It has a list of known ad servers and when your computer tries to contact one of these servers (to fetch an ad embedded in a web-page or app), it sends back 0.0.0.0 as the IP address. Your computer is unable to reach the ad server, so you don't see the ads - and the ad-tech company doesn't get to harvest your data.

I sent them my EFF case-study and they thought it was a great fit, so they programmed their ESPHole to count blocked ads a "Nah"s - so the screen will tell you "283 Nahs!" after blocking 283 ads.

&lt;a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/esphole-ad-blocker?view=all"&gt;https://learn.adafruit.com/esphole-ad-blocker?view=all&lt;/a&gt;

Back in 2015, Doc Searls called ad-blocking "the biggest consumer boycott in history." The industry claims it harvests and processes our data with our consent. Gadgets like the ESPHole let you withdraw that consent, and make it stick. It lets you say, "How about 'Nah?'"

&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180923223849/http://blogs-test.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180923223849/http://blogs-test.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/&lt;/a&gt;

In the early days of the browser, the web was taken over by an epidemic of obnoxious pop-up ads. They would spawn in invisible windows, or play sound, or run away from your cursor. Closing one would make three more pop up. We killed pop-ups once Mozilla and Opera shipped a browser with pop-up blocking turned on by default. All the arguments about whether pop-ups were good or bad for publishers or users were trumped by a technological fact: &lt;em&gt;no one sees pop-up ads anymore.&lt;/em&gt; Once that fact was true, pop-ups disappeared for good.

America desperately needs a federal privacy law with a private right of action, and the EU desperately needs to start actually enforcing the GDPR. But as important as these laws are, the technology has a role to play here. Stopping tracking in your browser, or across your whole home network, will make it much easier to get good laws passed and enforced. After all, if no one &lt;em&gt;sees&lt;/em&gt; invasive ads, the companies won't have any money to mobilize to block privacy laws.

The ESPHole is $25, plus another $5 for a USB cable if you don't already have one. I don't have any commercial interest in Adafruit or the ESPHole - but I am proud as anything to have played a small role in inspiring this great little gadget.

&lt;h1&gt;Killing online surveillance with contextual ads (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/29/taken-in-context/#creep-me-not"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The internet has ushered in an era of unprecedented invasive surveillance. Commercial operators large and small spy on us in every way and sell and give away and leak our data to criminals, cops, spies, advertisers and stalkers.

This isn't because you're not paying for "the product," which makes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; the product. Companies that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; abuse you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;.

John Deere will sell you a $800,000 tractor and then lock you out of getting it fixed so they can charge you a fortune for repairs. You're paying for the product, but you're still the product.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/09/pig-pedometer-blaze/#huskerdont"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/09/pig-pedometer-blaze/#huskerdont&lt;/a&gt;

Apple wants you to think that paying $1,000 for an Iphone means you're not the product, but you are. Apple runs the same repair racket as John Deere, and then they rake 15-30% off of every dime you spend in an app. Apple's selling you to app makers: you're the product.

&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/44e93ede-60b5-4eb2-8548-61ad13a7550e"&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/44e93ede-60b5-4eb2-8548-61ad13a7550e&lt;/a&gt;

The biggest predictor of whether a company will treat you as the product is whether anyone will stop them. Sometimes you can stop them - by shopping elsewhere, say (though it's damned hard to shop your way out of monopoly capitalism!). More often, the thing that stops companies from abusing you is laws that ban abuse, and regulators who enforce the laws vigorously.

Back to online surveillance. The ad-tech industry (and, ironically, many of its critics) say that spying on you all the time and in every way makes ads vastly more effective. We shouldn't take their word for it. Ad-tech is a giant scam, a vast accounting fraud of fake ads shown to fake users with fake billings producing trillions in real profits:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost&lt;/a&gt;

Paying for media doesn't mean that companies won't abuse you. Not paying for media doesn't mean they will. The determinant of your abuse is whether companies will suffer consequences for it. While there are some problems with ad-supported media, they're completely separate from the problems of surveillance - and the problems of surveillance are much &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; than the problems of ads. That's why we should ban surveillance ads.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/22/myob/#adtech-considered-harmful"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/22/myob/#adtech-considered-harmful&lt;/a&gt;

Wait, I hear you saying. Doesn't Europe ban surveillance ads already, through the GDPR? Well, yes, technically, they do. The process of getting consent for surveillance ads under the GDPR is deliberately so cumbersome that it is effectively impossible to run a surveillance ad industry.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/16/inside-the-clock-tower/#inference"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/16/inside-the-clock-tower/#inference&lt;/a&gt;

So how is it that Google and Facebook and other ad-tech companies operate in Europe? Simple: they break the law. They - and many other companies - claim that they don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; your consent to spy on you, because they can use the "legitimate interest" clause of the GDPR that allows them to process your data without asking you. This is a lie, and it's only a lack of enforcement that allows the tech giants to get away with it (it's possible that the new Digital Services Act will finally spur enforcement).

So let's say we ban surveillance advertising. Will that wipe out ad-supported media and produce a world where "the truth is paywalled but the lies are free"?

&lt;a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/the-truth-is-paywalled-but-the-lies-are-free/"&gt;https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/the-truth-is-paywalled-but-the-lies-are-free/&lt;/a&gt;

Not at all. It's possible to advertise to you without spying on you. It's a very old technique, in fact: rather than targeting ads to you, the reader, the advertiser targets the article you're reading. If you're reading about winter sports, then you get ads for skis and winter package holidays and hockey leagues.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/05/behavioral-v-contextual/#contextual-ads"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/05/behavioral-v-contextual/#contextual-ads&lt;/a&gt;

These are called contextual ads, and there's pretty good evidence that it works about as well as surveillance ads. But I have to admit that for some advertisers, contextual ads won't work as well as surveillance ads, which means that some publishers' content will generate fewer ad dollars overall.

But that doesn't mean publishers will earn less by switching to contextual ads. For one thing, the surveillance ad market is rigged, with about half of ad spending disappearing into the offshore, tax-free bank accounts of big tech companies (which is why I say "Big Tech isn't stealing newspapers' content, it's stealing their money"):

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/18/news-isnt-secret/#bid-shading"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/18/news-isnt-secret/#bid-shading&lt;/a&gt;

One of the ways that Big Tech maintains its death-grip on advertising spending is through its "data-advantage": Google and Facebook are a lot better at spying on you than any potential rivals, which means that so long as surveillance-based targeting dominates, then Googbook will also dominate. The corollary: ban surveillance advertising and you annihilate that data-advantage at the stroke of a pen. That means that publishers can negotiate more reasonable splits with ad platforms and take a bigger piece of the (possibly) smaller context ad pie.

We don't even need to ban surveillance advertising to force the switch to contextual advertising. Just forcing companies to obtain meaningful consent before spying on users would effectively eliminate surveillance ads.

As Rande Price writes for Digital Content Next, people &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; surveillance ads. It creeps them out. 79% of internet users prefer context ads to surveillance ads.

&lt;a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2022/04/26/contextual-may-be-a-better-alternative-to-behavioral-advertising/"&gt;https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2022/04/26/contextual-may-be-a-better-alternative-to-behavioral-advertising/&lt;/a&gt;

That number comes from a Harris Poll:

&lt;a href="https://www.toolbox.com/marketing/programmatic-advertising/news/79-percent-consumers-are-comfortable-with-contextual-ads/"&gt;https://www.toolbox.com/marketing/programmatic-advertising/news/79-percent-consumers-are-comfortable-with-contextual-ads/&lt;/a&gt;

It's part of an unbroken string of surveys that find that large majorities of internet users do not consent to surveillance ads. Indeed, a Yougov poll found that 38% of users say surveillance ads make them feel "creeped out" (31% feel "violated").

&lt;a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/"&gt;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/&lt;/a&gt;

No wonder so many people are ad-blocking ("the biggest consumer boycott in history" -Doc Searls). If publishers want users to look at ads, they have to stop making them feel "violated" and "creeped out."

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/28/shut-yer-pi-hole/#largest-boycott-in-world-history"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/28/shut-yer-pi-hole/#largest-boycott-in-world-history&lt;/a&gt;

Fewer people will block contextual ads - publishers only get paid for ads that actually show up on the user's screen. What's more, it's harder to corner the market for serving contextual ads, meaning that publishers will be able to shop for a bigger share of the ads they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; serve.

We should get rid of surveillance ads because they expose us to all kinds of risks - leaks, police fishing expeditions, digital discrimination and more. But publishers should support getting rid of surveillance ads because a switch to contextual ads will make them (lots) more money.

&lt;h1&gt;Podcasting "Apple's Cement Overshoes" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/30/80-lbs#malicious-compliance"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

This week on my podcast, I read my recent Medium column, "Apple's Cement Overshoes," about the incredible, cynical fuckery that Apple engages in to sabotage right to repair and ensure that its devices end up in overseas e-waste landfills rather than being fixed and kept in service.

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/apples-cement-overshoes-329856288d13"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/apples-cement-overshoes-329856288d13&lt;/a&gt;

For all the debate around Right to Repair, it's amazing how simple the actual issue is. On the anti- side, you have companies who say that their users are a bunch of idiotic babies who can't be trusted to make their own choices about who fixes their stuff, and which parts they use. The companies say that they should be given the authority to decide who can effect repairs, and under which circumstances - and that they will only use this authority to keep their users safe.

On the pro-repair side, you have people who say that companies aren't always the best choice for fixing the products they originate, and that the more leeway companies have to block repair competition, the worse their own repair services get. When companies have to compete against an independent repair sector, they have to offer attractive prices and they have to keep up a supply of parts so older products can be kept in service.

When users decide who gets to fix their stuff, they can make trade-offs that they alone can appreciate - like the choice to keep using an older device rather than sending it to a landfill, or the choice to fix their own gadget because they have an urgent need (say, a farmer who wants to fix their own tractor so they can bring in the crops before a storm).

Apple leads the anti-repair axis, which is weird, considering the company's origins. The Apple ][+ gave rise to a generation of hardware hackers because it shipped with Steve Wozniak's gorgeous hardware schematics, inviting tinkerers to extend, modify and fix their machines.

&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/18/steve-wozniak-schematics-auction/"&gt;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/18/steve-wozniak-schematics-auction/&lt;/a&gt;

But there is &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a powerful temptation to break repair. A desktop computer only needs replacement when it goes obsolete - unlike a laptop or a phone or a smart-watch, your iMac is unlikely to suffer a cracked screen, get run over by a bus, get dropped in a toilet, or fall down a sewer-grate. The migration of computers from our desks to our backpacks, pockets and wrists is potentially wildly profitable. Not only do the damages from portability let manufacturers charge a fortune for repairs, but it lets them entice or coerce their customers into upgrading, rather than fixing, their gadgets.

Apple isn't particularly subtle about why it fights independent repair. CEO Tim Cook started 2019 with his annual shareholder letter, in which he warned his investors that Apple's profits were threatened by customers who stubbornly chose to get their old gadgets fixed rather than trading them into Apple for replacements:

&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/"&gt;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/&lt;/a&gt;

He wasn't taking that risk lying down. In 2018, Apple led an anti-repair axis of giant companies - including Wahl, John Deere, major appliance makers, and others - in defeating 18 state right to repair bills that would have forced companies to supply diagnostic information, manuals, and tools to independent service depots.

These right to repair bills didn't come out of nowhere: they represented the independent repair sector's frustration with giant corporations' ongoing legal and technical assaults on the fix-it shops that keep our gadgets working for us, and out of landfills.

Long before Apple killed those right to repair bills, it was inventing and perfecting the anti-repair playbook that other industries followed. Apple used three tactics to fight repair:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiding documentation. Not only does Apple fail to publish its repair manuals, it actually treats them as trade-secrets, forcing internal and external technicians to sign nondisclosure agreements as a condition of accessing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking parts. Apple goes to enormous lengths to keep replacement parts out of independent repairers' hands. When you bring your busted Apple product to an Apple Store, they'll often offer you a trade-in deal. If you take it, Apple gets to send your gadget to its "recyclers" who drop it in a giant shredder, a nonstandard practice that ensures that no one harvests working parts out of those broken devices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/yp73jw/apple-recycling-iphones-macbooks"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/yp73jw/apple-recycling-iphones-macbooks&lt;/a&gt;

Apple also engraves minuscule Apple logos on tiny, internal parts, and uses these as to make bizarre trademark claims with US Customs, resulting in refurbished, original Apple parts being seized at the border and destroyed as "counterfeits":

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVL65qwBGnw"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVL65qwBGnw&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VIN-locking. This is when a manufacturer uses embedded processors to rig their products to reject new parts unless an authorized technician enters an unlock code into the device. Though this originated in the automotive sector, it's metastasized to phones, tractors, medical implants and hospital equipment:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors-bc93f471b9c8"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors-bc93f471b9c8&lt;/a&gt;

All of this is good for Apple's shareholders, but it's terrible for its customers, and the world that we all share with them. Apple devices - like all electronics - are stuffed with toxic waste, conflict minerals and heavy metals, and require torrents of scarce fresh water and carbon-intensive energy to make. The longer these devices stay in use, the better it is for the planet. When they're shredded, they're exported to overseas e-waste dumps that are environmental and human-rights disasters:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/26/nixing-the-fix/#r2r"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/26/nixing-the-fix/#r2r&lt;/a&gt;

On a more basic level, though, blocking repair is indefensible in a market economy. When you buy a gadget, it's yours. You are allowed to do whatever you want with it, even stupid things. If there are ways of using your product that are so dangerous to others that they should be banned, we do that with democratically accountable laws, not unilateral commands from corporations with unresolvable conflicts of interest.

What's more, repair is in the national interest. Repair makes supply-chains resilient, keeping vital equipment in service when manufacturers are unreachable and unavailable or simply disappear. Repair is also an engine for economic development: landfilling a ton of e-waste creates one job; recycling that ton creates 15 jobs.

Repairing a ton of e-waste creates &lt;em&gt;200&lt;/em&gt; high-paid, local jobs. 200! Repair accounts for 4% of US GDP.

&lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution"&gt;https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution&lt;/a&gt;

When monopolists attack right to repair efforts, they often point out that repair advocates make money from fixing your stuff, as though this was some kind of damning conflict of interest. It's bizarre. Yeah, your neighbor who runs your corner fix-it shop pays their mortgage by fixing your phone for you. Was there anyone who didn't understand this?

What's more, Apple - or Wahl, or GM, or John Deere - aren't exactly charitable nonprofits whose repair programs are operated as a public service. Apple was - and likely will be - a $3 trillion company. But all the money in the world wasn't enough to make right to repair go away. People stubbornly keep insisting on being able to choose their own repair technicians, and rejecting a future where we all drown in e-waste. It's shocking, honestly - won't anyone think of the poor shareholders?

Apple kept racking up wins at the state level, killing right to repair initiatives, but the company could read the writing on the wall: repair was coming. It's a matter of when, not if. So Apple switched to Plan B: they invented repairwashing, fake repair programs that kept its repair racket intact, but made it seem like it was cooperating with the repair sector.

In 2019, Apple launched its certified independent repair program, which allowed independent repair shops to fix some iPhone screens, with Apple's blessing. The program was a joke. Despite only allowing screen repairs, Apple refused to supply certified shops with parts to do these repairs. Instead, the shops must gather their customers' sensitive personal information and send it to Apple, wait for Apple to verify it, and send the needed part.

&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/09/03/pressured-right-to-repair-movement-apple-will-sell-parts-to-independent-repair-shops/"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/2019/09/03/pressured-right-to-repair-movement-apple-will-sell-parts-to-independent-repair-shops/&lt;/a&gt;

Participants had to promise not to do any repairs other than the few that Apple permitted, which meant that shops that joined the program had to &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; the services they offered to their customers. They also had to promise not to buy third-party or refurb parts, and submit to random audits.

Unsurprisingly, they got few takers for this offer, but that wasn't the point. The point was to have a program that they could cite as part of their future efforts to kill right to repair laws: "See, the market is working! No need for government intervention!"

This was just a stalling tactic. It couldn't last forever. Eventually, enough lawmakers would get briefed on how restrictive the program was, and so Apple needed Plan C: Repairwashing, the home edition.

Last spring, the FTC reported on its two year Nixing the Fix investigation into repair, publishing a ringing endorsement for independent repair as good for Americans, for resilience, for the economy, and for the environment:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/07/pro-act-class-war/#we-fixit"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/07/pro-act-class-war/#we-fixit&lt;/a&gt;

A few months later, the Biden admin dropped a resounding executive order on right to repair:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/10/unnixing-the-fix/#r2r-plus-plus"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/10/unnixing-the-fix/#r2r-plus-plus&lt;/a&gt;

And a few months after &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, Apple announced a new "home repair program" that would send real Apple "parts, tools and manuals" to iPhone owners who wanted to replace their screens or batteries. The announcement prompted a lot of speculation about how Apple would neuter this offer:

&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/&lt;/a&gt;

Even the wildest guesses fell short of Apple's jaw-dropping, industry-leading fuckery. This month, The Verge's Sean Hollister ordered an Apple home repair kit, and found himself in possession of &lt;em&gt;79 pounds&lt;/em&gt; of Apple gear:

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/21/23079058/apple-self-service-iphone-repair-kit-hands-on"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/21/23079058/apple-self-service-iphone-repair-kit-hands-on&lt;/a&gt;

Apple shipped Hollister two Pelican cases' worth of phone-fixing tools, starting with an industrial glue-melting machine so he could separate his phone's case (Apple is Exhibit A in the case for "screws, not glue" to aid in repairs). The machine didn't work on the first or second try, and only managed the trick when Hollister located and engaged a hidden turbo-suction mode. Even then, it left behind a gross, gluey residue that was supposed to come away with tweezers (not included in the 79lb kit, and also, this didn't work).

The process of replacing the iPhone battery is a master-class in planned obsolescence. Any device that survives for more than a couple years needs to have its battery replaced. Apple likes to pretend this isn't true - indeed, the company secretly slowed down older phones' processors so they wouldn't chew through their failing batteries. The Batterygate scandal cost Apple $113m:

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batterygate"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batterygate&lt;/a&gt;

Despite this, Hollister discovered that replacing his battery required removing three different kinds of security screws as well as innumerable tiny, fiddly clips that held the ribbon-cables in. The screwdrivers in the 79 lb repair kit don't have the otherwise standard magnetic tips, leaving Hollister to chase minuscule metal bits around his workbench.

Apple claims the 79 lb kit is full of "professional" tools, and it places a $1,200 hold on your credit card to cover the cost of replacement, should you lose or break them. For professional tools, these are awfully amateur-hour: it's not just the nonfunctional glue-melter or the unmagnetized screwdrivers. For example, the press that holds the battery down kept slipping, knocking the battery out of alignment.

But eventually, Hollister finished the repair - and his phone &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; didn't work. It turns out the battery Apple ships is VIN-locked, and the phone won't recognize it until you phone an authorized third-party repair technician, cable your phone to a laptop, connect to the internet, and allow the technician to remotely access your phone (and all its data!) and then bless the repair by keying in an unlock code.

This is clearly more repairwashing. As Hollister points out, Apple eats the cost of shipping the repair kits, about $200 each way. That's a pretty good indicator that Apple doesn't think anyone's going to go through an 80-page repair at home - especially not one that actually &lt;em&gt;costs more&lt;/em&gt; than bringing your phone to Apple for the same repair.

It's worth contrasting this repair with iFixit's equivalent, third-party repair experience. For $20-50, iFixit will ship you a battery and all the tools you need to do the repair, and they repair excellent manuals and videos showing you how to do the fix:

&lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Kits/iPhone-Fix-Kits/iPhone-Battery-Kits"&gt;https://www.ifixit.com/Kits/iPhone-Fix-Kits/iPhone-Battery-Kits&lt;/a&gt;

Rather than using an "industrial grade heat-station" to melt your phone's glue, iFixit shows you how to use a heat-gun or even a hair-dryer. If you want to get fancy, you can invest $20 on an iOpener - a gel-filled sock that you microwave and then wrap around your phone:

&lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/iOpener/IF145-198?o=9"&gt;https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/iOpener/IF145-198?o=9&lt;/a&gt;

Apple's home repair program is an unfunny joke. The company's decision to design its devices so they are actively hostile to repair is an environmental crime, something that's getting harder to deny as truly innovative companies pop up with elegant, lightweight, rugged, high-performance gadgets that can be fully serviced by their owners:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/21/monica-byrne/#think-different"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/21/monica-byrne/#think-different&lt;/a&gt;

What's more, these devices can be upgraded piecemeal - their owners can easily install a faster processor or a better camera when they become available, without junking the whole device:

&lt;a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/05/framwork-laptop-12th-gen-intel-cpu-upgrade-kit"&gt;https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/05/framwork-laptop-12th-gen-intel-cpu-upgrade-kit&lt;/a&gt;

Right to repair is a no-brainer, which means that even mighty Apple, with all its tax-evading trillions, can't keep it at bay alone. Apple leads an anti-repair coalition of multinationals that strangle right to repair wherever they can.

Apple was at the forefront in killing New Hampshire's R2R law. The state's motto might be "live free or die," but Rep. John Potucek - who helped kill the law - adopted a much bootlickier motto: "cellphones are throwaways...just get a new one."

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kp8j/lawmaker-kills-repair-bill-because-cellphones-are-throwaways"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kp8j/lawmaker-kills-repair-bill-because-cellphones-are-throwaways&lt;/a&gt;

In Ohio, Apple taught appliance manufacturers how to convince lawmakers not to vote for right to repair. Ever notice how your parents' washing machines and dishwashers lasted for decades, while yours are beyond repair the day after the warranty expires?

&lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbxk3b/appliance-companies-are-lobbying-against-right-to-repair"&gt;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbxk3b/appliance-companies-are-lobbying-against-right-to-repair&lt;/a&gt;

In Ontario, Doug Ford's "Open for business" provincial parliament killed right to repair, shafting small Ontario repair businesses to protect the ability of a California company to gouge Ontarians on repairs (please, Ontarians, do not re-elect this bumblefuck):

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kxayy/right-to-repair-bill-killed-after-big-tech-lobbying-in-ontario"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kxayy/right-to-repair-bill-killed-after-big-tech-lobbying-in-ontario&lt;/a&gt;

The anti-repair lobby is still killing right to repair legislation. Just this week, John Deere and its Big Ag coalition got repair stripped out of a North Carolina bill, arguing that repair was &lt;em&gt;bad for the environment&lt;/em&gt; because evil farmers might turn off their emissions controls:

&lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article261738957.html"&gt;https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article261738957.html&lt;/a&gt;

In California, a repair bill just died in the state senate, despite support from 75% of voters. The bill died thanks to FUD straight out of Apple's playbook, which warned about data-theft, patent infringement, and the whole cliched parade of anti-repair horribles:

&lt;a href="https://calpirg.org/news/cap/california-right-repair-bill-dies-senate-committee"&gt;https://calpirg.org/news/cap/california-right-repair-bill-dies-senate-committee&lt;/a&gt;

There was a time when Apple championed repair. Apple customers have fond memories of repair depots like NYC's legendary Tekserve, immortalized in Tamara Shopsin's incredible novel LaserWriter II:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/29/norwegian-potato-flour-enchiladas/#r2r"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/29/norwegian-potato-flour-enchiladas/#r2r&lt;/a&gt;

Today, the company has committed its prodigious engineering, legal and lobbying muscle to preventing repair, designing gadgets of exquisite repair-hostility:

&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/08/everyones-airpods-will-die-weve-got-trick-replacing-them/"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/08/everyones-airpods-will-die-weve-got-trick-replacing-them/&lt;/a&gt;

We can't afford this. It's not just the cost of replacing your gadgets rather than fixing them. It's the environmental cost, the human rights cost, the brittleness of our supply-chains, the collapse of local repair jobs.

&lt;h1&gt;Decrapify cookie consent dialogs with the Consent-O-Matic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/28/bartlebytron-3000/#i-would-prefer-not-to"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Remember when they sneered at Geocities pages for being unusable eyesores? It's true, those old sites had some, uh, &lt;em&gt;idiosyncratic&lt;/em&gt; design choices, but at least they reflected a real person's exuberant ideas about what looked and worked well. Today's web is an unusable eyesore &lt;em&gt;by design&lt;/em&gt;.

Start with those fucking "sign up for our newsletter" interruptors. Email is the last federated protocol standing, so everyone who publishes is desperate to get you to sign up to their newsletter, which nominally bypasses Big Tech's chokepoint on communications between creators and audiences. Worst part: they're wrong, email's also been captured:

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d&lt;/a&gt;

Then there's the designer's bizarre and sadistic conceit that "black type on a white background" is ugly and "causes eye-strain." This has led to an epidemic of illegible grey-on-white type that I literally can't read, thanks to a (very common) low-contrast vision disability:

&lt;a href="https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/"&gt;https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/&lt;/a&gt;

Often grey-on-white type sins are compounded with minuscule font sizing. You can correct this by increasing the font size from teeny-weeny-eyestrain-o-rama to something reasonable, but when you do, all the static elements on the page size up with the text, so the useless header and footer bars filled with social media buttons and vanity branding expand to fill the whole screen.

This, in turn, is made a billion times worse by the absurd decision to hide scrollbars (shades of Douglas Adams' description of airports where they "expose the plumbing on the grounds that it is functional, and conceal the location of the departure gates, presumably on the grounds that they are not").

&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3205828-it-can-hardly-be-a-coincidence-that-no-language-on"&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3205828-it-can-hardly-be-a-coincidence-that-no-language-on&lt;/a&gt;

Scrolling a window (without using RSI-inflaming trackpad gestures) is now the world's shittiest, most widely played video-game, a hand-eye coordination challenge requiring sub-pixel accuracy and split-second timing to catch the scroll-bar handle in the brief, flashing instant where blips into existence:

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1516136202235043841"&gt;https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1516136202235043841&lt;/a&gt;

One of the scariest things about the precarity of Firefox is the prospect of losing some of the customizations and stock features I rely on to decrapify the web - stuff I use so often that I sometimes forget that it's not how everyone uses the web:

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/firefox-mozilla-2022/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/firefox-mozilla-2022/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="Two side-by-side screenshots comparing the default layout of a wired.com article ('The intoxicating pleasure of conspiratorial thinking' by Virginia Heffernan) with the same article in Firefox's Reader Mode." src="https://craphound.com/images/reader-mode.jpeg"/&gt;

For example, there's Firefox's Reader Mode: a hotkey that strips out all the layout and renders the text of an article as a narrow, readable column in whatever your default font is. I reach for ctrl-alt-r so instinctively that often the publisher's default layout doesn't register for me.

Reader Mode (usually) bypasses interruptors and static elements, but Firefox isn't capable of deploying Reader Mode on every site. The Activate Reader View plugin can sometimes fix this:

&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/activate-reader-view/"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/activate-reader-view/&lt;/a&gt;

But when it can't there's my favorite, indispensable Javascript bookmarklet: Kill Sticky, which hunts through the DOM of the page you've got loaded and nukes any element that is tagged as "sticky" - which generally banishes any permanent top/bottom/side-bars with a single click:

&lt;a href="https://github.com/t-mart/kill-sticky"&gt;https://github.com/t-mart/kill-sticky&lt;/a&gt;

A recent addition to my arsenal is Cookie Remover. Click it once and it deletes all cookies associated with the page you've currently loaded. This resets the counter on every soft paywall, including the ones that block you from using Private Browsing. Click this once, then reload, and you're back in business:

&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-remover/"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-remover/&lt;/a&gt;

Today, I added another plug-in to my decrapification rotation: Consent-O-Matic, created by researchers at Denmark's Aarhus University. Consent-O-Matic identifies about 50 of the most commonly deployed GDPR tracking opt-out dialog boxes and automatically opts you out of all tracking, invisibly and instantaneously:

&lt;a href="https://consentomatic.au.dk/"&gt;https://consentomatic.au.dk/&lt;/a&gt;

We shouldn't need Consent-O-Matic, but we do. The point of the GDPR was to make tracking users painful for internet companies, by forcing them to break down all the different data they wanted to gather and the uses they wanted to put it to into a series of simple, yes/no consent requests. The idea was to create boardroom discussions where one person said, "OK, let's collect this invasive piece of data" and someone else could say, "Fine, but that will require us to display eight additional dialog boxes so we'll lose 95% of users if we do."

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/26/ico-ico/#market-structuring"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/26/ico-ico/#market-structuring&lt;/a&gt;

What's more, the GDPR said that if you just bypassed all those dialog boxes (say, by flipping to Reader Mode), the publisher had to assume you &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; want to be tracked.

But that's not how it's worked. A series of structural weaknesses in European federalism and the text of the GDPR itself have served to encrapify the web to a previously unheard-of degree, subjecting users to endless cookie consent forms that are designed to trick you into opting into surveillance.

Part of this is an enforcement problem. The EU Commission we have today isn't the Commission that created the GDPR, and there's a pervasive belief that the current Commission decided that enforcing their predecessors' policies wasn't a priority. This issue is very hot today, as the Commission considers landmark rules like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), whose enforcement will be at the whim of their successors.

The failures of EU-wide enforcement is compounded by the very nature of European federalism, which gives member states broad latitude to interpret and enforce EU regulations. This is most obviously manifested in EU member states' tax policies, with rogue nations like Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Ireland vying for supreme onshore-offshore tax haven status.

Not surprisingly, countries whose tax-codes have been hijacked by multinational corporations and their enablers in government are likewise subject to having their other regulations captured by the companies that fly their flags of convenience.

America's biggest Big Tech giants all pretend to be headquartered in Ireland (which, in turn, allows them to pretend that their profits are hovering in a state of untaxable grace far above the Irish Sea). These same companies ensured that Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner's Office is starved of cash and resources. Big Tech argues that their Irish domicile means that anyone who wants to complain about their frequent and enthusiastic practice of wiping their asses with the text of the GDPR has to take it up with the starveling regulators of Ireland.

That may change. Max Schrems - whose advocacy gave rise to the GDPR in the first place - has dragged the tech giants in front of &lt;em&gt;German&lt;/em&gt; regulators, who are decidedly more energetic than their Irish counterparts:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/#noyb"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/#noyb&lt;/a&gt;

The new EU tech competition laws - the DMA and DSA - aim to fix this, shoring up enforcement in a way that should end these "consent" popups. They also seek to plug the GDPR's "legitimate purpose" loophole, which lets tech companies spy on you and sell your data without your consent, provided they claim that this is for a "legitimate purpose."

But in the meantime, GDPR consent dialogs remain a hot mess, which is where Consent-O-Matic comes in. Consent-O-Matic automates away the tedious work of locating all the different switches you have to click before you &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; opt out of consent-based tracking. This practice of requiring you to seek out multiple UI elements is often termed a "Dark Pattern":

&lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3313831.3376321"&gt;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3313831.3376321&lt;/a&gt;

But while "Dark Pattern" has some utility as a term-of-art, I think that it's best reserved for truly sneaky tactics. Most of what we call "Dark Patterns" fits comfortably in under the term "fraud." For example, if "Opt Out of All" doesn't opt out of all, unless you find and toggle another "I Really Mean It" box, that's not a fiendish trick, it's just a scam.

Whether you call this "fraud" or a "Dark Pattern," Consent-O-Matic has historic precedent that suggests that it could really make a difference. I'm thinking here of the original browser wars, where Netscape and Internet Explorer (and others like Opera) fought for dominance on the early web.

That early web had its own crapification: the ubiquitous pop-up ad. Merely opening a page could spawn &lt;em&gt;dozens&lt;/em&gt; of pop-ups, some of them invisible 1px-by-1px dots, others that would run away from your cursor across the screen if you tried to close them, and they'd all be tracking you and auto-playing 8-bit music.

The pop-up ad was killed by the pop-up &lt;em&gt;blocker&lt;/em&gt;. When browsers like Mozilla and Opera started blocking pop-ups by default, users switched to them in droves. That meant that an ever-smaller proportion of web users could even &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; a pop-up, which meant that advertisers stopped demanding pop-ups. Publishers - who knew their readers hated pop-ups but were beholden to advertisers to keep the lights on - were finally able to convince advertisers that pop-ups were a bad idea. Why pay for ads that no one will see?

Pop-up blockers are an early example of Adversarial Interoperability, AKA Competitive Compatibility (comcom for short). That's the practice of improving an existing product or service by making an add-on or plug in that changes how it behaves to make it more responsive to its users' interests, without permission from the original manufacturer:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability&lt;/a&gt;

It's been more than 20 years since the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) tried to get tech companies to voluntarily recognize and honor their users' privacy choices. It failed:

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3P"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3P&lt;/a&gt;

Do Not Track, another attempt to do the same, did not fare much better:

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track&lt;/a&gt;

But you know what actually worked? Tracker-blockers and ad-blockers, "the largest consumer boycott in history":

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah&lt;/a&gt;

Making it &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to track users is of great assistance to efforts to make it &lt;em&gt;illegal&lt;/em&gt; to track users. Tools like Consent-O-Matic change the "security economics" of crapification, by turning the consent theater of illegal cookie popups into actual, GDPR-enforceable demands by users not to be tracked:

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/automation-is-magic-f4c1401d1f0d"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/automation-is-magic-f4c1401d1f0d&lt;/a&gt;

Decrapifying the web is a long, slow process. It's not just using interoperability to restore pluralism to the web, ending the era of "five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of text from the other four":

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040"&gt;https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040&lt;/a&gt;

It's also using a mix of technology and regulation to fight back against deliberate crapification. Between Consent-O-Matic, Reader Mode, Kill Sticky and Cookie Remover, it's possible to decrapify much of your daily browsing and substantially improve your life.

&lt;h1&gt;"The Swerve" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/05/grab-the-wheel/#fragile-hope"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

My latest &lt;em&gt;Locus Magazine&lt;/em&gt; column is "The Swerve," a short essay about the shape that hope takes when happy endings are off the table - it's specifically about the looming environmental collapse, but it also describes my view on the polycrisis of musketfuckery, forced birth, and covid denial:

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2022/07/cory-doctorow-the-swerve/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2022/07/cory-doctorow-the-swerve/&lt;/a&gt;

In this metaphor, we are in a bus barreling toward a cliff. The people in the front seats - who control the driver - insist that we don't need to turn the bus before we go over the edge. Indeed, they insist that turning the wheel is reckless, because the bus might roll and someone might break a leg.

When we demand to know what they're going to do about that cliff and the long plummet to the rocks below, we're called alarmists. There's plenty of time to build a bridge. Also, maybe we don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a bridge! Maybe we'll figure out how to add wings to the bus, or a cool rocket engine!

I wrote this column back in May (print magazines have long production cycles). Back then, the southwest was on fire and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; was reporting on the "carbon bombs" that the fossil fuel industry was planning to detonate around us:

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas&lt;/a&gt;

Six weeks later, I write these words from beneath a "heat dome" over my home in California that has made leaving the house literally painful for several hours every day. We're almost at wildfire season, too.

Then there's the polycrisis, which has exploded over the past six weeks, as the war in Ukraine deepened, as mass shootings swept the country, as forced birth laws went into effect in more than a dozen states. Omicron BA.4/5 is kicking off, escaping both vaccine and recovery immunities.

The time to fix the climate emergency was decades ago, back when Exxon's own scientists warned them that action was needed (#ExxonKnew). They warned us about the cliff over the horizon, and Exxon - and the rest of the hydrocarbon death cult - spent billions to convince us that there was no cliff.

The good news is that climate denial is over (covid denial's still in its prime, though). The bad news is that the deniers have pivoted to incrementalism. They want us to tinker in the margins. Swap out plastic straws for paper ones (but keep pretending that all the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; single-use plastic is recyclable).

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/26/plastic-fatalistic/#recycled-lies"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/26/plastic-fatalistic/#recycled-lies&lt;/a&gt;

Switch to electric vehicles (and keep up the geometrically incoherent pretense that it's possible to climate-harden our cities without public transit).

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/technology-transportation-road-to-nowhere/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/technology-transportation-road-to-nowhere/&lt;/a&gt;

Europe - and the world - now say that if we're going to switch off the supply of Russian gas, we're going to have to switch the coal plants back on. You can punish the mad dictator of Russia, or you can have a habitable planet for your kids, but not both.

There's an old joke from Ireland whose punchline is "If you wanted to get there, I wouldn't start from here." The time to build out renewable capacity and shutter oil and gas and coal plants was twenty years ago. We could have started under George HW Bush, who campaigned in 1988 on convening a global summit, including China and the USSR, to "talk about global warming." But the climate deniers went to work on Bush after he took office, and in 1992, he told the Rio Earth Summit that "the American way of life is not up for negotiations. Period."

We have run out of time to build a bridge. We're going to have to yank the bus wheel. At this late stage, the hopeful future is based on the swerve. The people at the front are right that this will probably roll the bus. They're right that it's gonna hurt. But they're wrong about everything else.

As I write in &lt;em&gt;Locus&lt;/em&gt;, "I don’t know what the first-class passengers were thinking. Some of them will be dead of natural causes before the bus goes over the cliff, and they didn’t want to sacrifice any of their material comforts to ensure that the rest of us continued to live once they passed on, I suppose.

"Others are just ideologically committed to traveling in a straight line. The swerve is morally bankrupt. It’s communism. The only way to get over the cliff – if such a thing exists – is to &lt;em&gt;floor&lt;/em&gt; the bus. Go as fast as possible. Leap the gorge! The Fonz did it, right?"

One week ago, I became a US citizen. Friends asked me why I'd want to become a citizen of a country whose politics and culture have descended into such dysfunction? I answered that it was the dysfunction that made me want my citizenship.

Remember when Trump's Muslim Ban went into effect and permanent residents of the US were taken into immigration detention and denied access to lawyers unless they surrendered their Green Cards first? President DeSantis or Cruz will do the same and worse.

The more human rights I can lay claim to, the better. Citizenship isn't an inviolable shield against authoritarians, but the life of a US citizen is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; less precarious than the life of an immigrant, even one with "permanent residency."

Yesterday was July 4, my first Independence Day as an American citizen. I made dinner and we hosted friends, and I decorated the back yard with my American heroes - dozens of photos of people who fought in some way to make this a better place:

&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=americanheroes&amp;amp;amp;user_id=37996580417%40N01&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=americanheroes&amp;amp;amp;user_id=37996580417%40N01&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1&lt;/a&gt;

We ate dinner surrounded by these fighters, who all tried to grab the wheel in one way or another. We ate while our phone chimed with news of mass shootings. We ate in the swelter of the heat dome.

The swerve is our hopeful future. It's not a future where we avoid disaster, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a future where we &lt;em&gt;stop pretending that there is no disaster.&lt;/em&gt; It's a future where refugee crises continue, but where we meet them with humanitarian aid, not gulags and razor wire.

It's a future of wildfires, but one where we use controlled burns to reduce them and evacuations to minimize their harm.

It's a future of habitat loss driving zoonotic plagues, but it's a future where we learn covid's lessons and apply them to create effective public health responses.

It's a future of mass extinctions, but it's also one where we commit to habitat restoration and rescue as many of our "horizontal brothers and sisters" (as John Muir put it) as we can.

In many ways, it's a terrible future. It's too late to build a bridge, or fix the bus's brakes, or do anything except yank the wheel. It's gonna hurt.

But the helpless nightmare of sitting in the back of the bus while its well-fed up there in the front rows insist that we can't do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;? Ending that is a hopeful future. It's the happy ending we can hope for.

It's too late to avoid disaster, but it doesn't have to be a catastrophe. We gotta grab the wheel. Oust every "good" politician who refuses to wield the power we handed to them. Work in your community to help your neighbors. Give material support to people fleeing cruel forced birth laws. Demand better. Fight. Be part of the lineage of American heroes who fought and fought. Fight on. Grab the wheel. Let's roll.

&lt;h1&gt;Epson boobytrapped its printers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/07/inky-wretches/#epson-salty"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

"Innovation" has become a curseword, thanks to...innovation. Some of the world's most imaginative, best-funded sociopaths have spent decades innovating ways to fuck you over. While the whole tech sector likes to get in on this game, no one "innovates" like inkjet printer companies.

Printer companies are true fuckery pioneers: the tactical innovations they've developed in the war on their customers would make Otto von Bismarck blush.

Selling printers with half-empty ink-cartridges:

&lt;a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/personal_finance/spending_saving/2012/08/19/new_printers_may_not_have_full_tank_of_ink.html"&gt;https://www.thestar.com/business/personal_finance/spending_saving/2012/08/19/new_printers_may_not_have_full_tank_of_ink.html&lt;/a&gt;

Requiring useless, mandatory "calibration tests" that use up all your ink:

&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/printers/the-high-cost-of-wasted-printer-ink/"&gt;https://www.consumerreports.org/printers/the-high-cost-of-wasted-printer-ink/&lt;/a&gt;

Or just having printers reject partially full cartridges as empty.

When you're at war with your customers, you have to anticipate that your rivals will join your customers' side - not because other businesses are paragons of consumer protection, but because it's profitable. So printer companies tried to use copyright to block ink refillers:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/lexmark-v-static-control-case-archive"&gt;https://www.eff.org/cases/lexmark-v-static-control-case-archive&lt;/a&gt;

Then patent law:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/impression-products-inc-v-lexmark-international-inc"&gt;https://www.eff.org/cases/impression-products-inc-v-lexmark-international-inc&lt;/a&gt;

When that got stale, they figured out how to put DRM in &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt;, too:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/worst-timeline-printer-company-putting-drm-paper-now"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/worst-timeline-printer-company-putting-drm-paper-now&lt;/a&gt;

If we could harness the creative energy put into turning printer users into ink-stained wretches, we could end the world's reliance on Russian gas in an instant:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer&lt;/a&gt;

Here's a good one! Epson will brick your printer after you've run a certain number of pages, "for your own good."

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marktavern/status/1550605262700122112"&gt;https://twitter.com/marktavern/status/1550605262700122112&lt;/a&gt;

How does that work? Well, Epson says that it designs its printers with little internal sponges that soak up excess ink and when they become saturated, that ink might run out of the bottom of your printer and stain your furniture.

&lt;a href="https://epson.com/Support/wa00369"&gt;https://epson.com/Support/wa00369&lt;/a&gt;

If this sounds like bullshit to you, that's because it's bullshit, as are the claims that excess ink could get into the printer's electronic circuits and start a fire:

&lt;a href="https://fighttorepair.substack.com/p/citing-danger-of-ink-spills-epson"&gt;https://fighttorepair.substack.com/p/citing-danger-of-ink-spills-epson&lt;/a&gt;

If your printer's sponges get too full of excess ink and you're worried about it, you can easily and cheaply install new sponges:

&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EocI_8awj38?t=112"&gt;https://youtu.be/EocI_8awj38?t=112&lt;/a&gt;

But that would deny Epson a new printer sale, and divert your perfectly good printer from joining the mountains of e-waste that are poisoning the global south, and we couldn't have that.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/26/nixing-the-fix/#r2r"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/26/nixing-the-fix/#r2r&lt;/a&gt;

So they've rigged their printers' software so that even if you replace the sponges, the printer can still refuse to print. Replacing or resetting this software requires that you bypass the DRM designed to prevent this, and providing a DRM-defeat tool is a felony punishable by a 5-year sentence and a $500k fine under Section 1201 of the DMCA.

But maybe this is a violation of consumer protection laws. Aaron Perzanowski thinks so, and he's a law professor. If the FTC were to go after Epson on this, they would be genuine American heroes, celebrated as true guardians of the public interest.

Previously, the FTC resolved this kind of self-bricking fraud by ordering companies to disclose the practice at the time of purchase. This is not good enough.

&lt;a href="https://www.perzanow.ski/blog/2016/7/14/ftcs-revolv-investigation"&gt;https://www.perzanow.ski/blog/2016/7/14/ftcs-revolv-investigation&lt;/a&gt;

A real remedy - one that would prevent this conduct in future - would be a ban on self-bricking devices altogether, along with immunity from civil and criminal liability for companies and individuals who design defeat devices to un-brick illegally bricked gadgets, under patent, copyright, contract, and all other legal theories.

&lt;h1&gt;Spotify steals from artists, a Spotify exclusive (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/12/streaming-doesnt-pay/#stunt-publishing"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In our next book, &lt;em&gt;Chokepoint Capitalism&lt;/em&gt;, Rebecca Giblin and I set out to shatter the false binary that creative workers can only choose between rooting for Big Tech or Big Content, as if one flavor of monopolist will be better for us than the other. No company epitomizes the hopelessness of this approach more than Spotify.

You've probably heard about the pathetic sums that creators earn from Spotify streaming, often blamed on the tech industry's unwillingness to pay creators what they're worth. Maybe you've also heard the rebuttal - that Spotify pays plenty to entertainment companies, but they intercept this money before it can get into creators' pockets.

That right there is the false binary - &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; Spotify is cheap, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the Big Three record labels are greedy. But what if - and hear me out here - Spotify is cheap &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the Big Three are greedy? What if Spotify and the labels are actually colluding to rip off the "talent"? What if &lt;em&gt;neither&lt;/em&gt; kind of monopolist is good for artists, and no matter how much we love them, they'll never truly love us back?

That's the thesis of Chapter 5 of &lt;em&gt;Chokepoint Capitalism&lt;/em&gt;, where we get into eye-watering detail on how Spotify and the Big Three work together to transfer value from creative workers to their own shareholders. We explain how the labels took ownership stakes in Spotify and then conspired to suppress creative wages so the company would seem more profitable in the runup to Spotify's IPO, which made &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; for the labels. We show how the labels and Spotify colluded to ensure that billions more in royalty payments were "unattributed" and thus not owed to any specific artist. We document how the payment system that Spotify and the labels cooked up does not even reward artists on the basis of how often their work is streamed - and how that deal was rammed down the throats of every indie label through the "most favored nation" status that Spotify guaranteed the Big Three.

It's a hell of a tale, a breakdown of scams like the sleazy accounting tricks used to halve the royalty rates that artists got when Spotify IPOed, and it even has a hero: Taylor Swift, who used her negotiating power to demand Universal Music give a better deal to everyone on its label. 
But Taylor Swift alone can't save us (though some of her fans might take a different view!). Her act of solidarity is no structural fix - no more than, say, Joe Rogan's $100,000,000 Spotify payday is.

Rogan's eye-popping deal has precious little to do with everyday creators' livings - he's like the guy that gets to win a giant teddy bear at the carnival midway game in the morning and then totes it around conspicuously for the rest of the day, luring other suckers to try their luck.

We wrote this book to discuss how &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; creative worker can get a better deal, with half the book given over to detailed, shovel-ready proposals for local, state and national laws, regulations, business opportunities, new technologies and other ways to smash open those chokepoints.

Once the book comes out on Sept 27, you'll be able to read all of Chapter 5, and its companion, Chapter 6 ("Why Spotify Wants You To Rely On Playlists") (spoiler: because it lets them lock in listeners, unlike albums, which are the same everywhere, and it lets them rip off artists by demanding payola).

You'll also be able to listen to the audio edition of those chapters, of course, though you won't be able to get it on Audible, Amazon's monopoly audiobook store. The only part of the book available on Audible is Chapter 13, "Transparency Rights," an "Audible Exclusive" that explains in similar detail how Audible steals from creators and locks in listeners:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/07/audible-exclusive/#audiblegate"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/07/audible-exclusive/#audiblegate&lt;/a&gt;

However, if you're a Spotify user, you can listen to the audio edition of Chapter 5 &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, because it is a Spotify Exclusive - and, as with our Audible exclusive, it's the only part of the audiobook you can get on Spotify (the part of the book that explains what a titanic ripoff Spotify is for artists):

&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7oLW9ANweI01CVbZUyH4Xg"&gt;https://open.spotify.com/show/7oLW9ANweI01CVbZUyH4Xg&lt;/a&gt;

(Go ahead, give it a listen! - Stefan Rudnicki does an &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; job with the narration).

As our Spotify chapter shows, avoiding the chokepoints in chokepoint capitalism is really, really hard - and every one of those chokepoints exists to pick artists' pockets. That's why we're Kickstarting the audio edition, in a crowdfunder that's now broken the $100,000 mark. You've still got a few days left to back it and join our supporters, who've pre-ordered hundreds of print books, and thousands of ebooks and audibooks, as well as donating hundreds of copies to libraries:

You can also meet us in person; we're going on the road with the book, starting next Friday, with an event in Toronto at Type Books in the Junction. From there, we move on to New York, LA, San Francisco, and beyond:

&lt;h1&gt;Undetectable, undefendable back-doors for machine learning (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/11/rene-descartes-was-a-drunken-fart/#trusting-trust"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Machine learning's promise is decisions at scale: using software to classify inputs (and, often, act on them) at a speed and scale that would be prohibitively expensive or even impossible using flesh-and-blood humans.

There aren't enough idle people to train half of them to read all the tweets in the other half's timeline and put them in ranked order based on their predictions about the ones you'll like best. ML promises to do a good-enough job that you won't mind.

Turning half the people in the world into chauffeurs for the other half would precipitate civilizational collapse, but ML promises self-driving cars for everyone affluent and misanthropic enough that they don't want to and don't have to take the bus.

There aren't enough trained medical professionals to look at every mole and tell you whether it's precancerous, not enough lab-techs to assess every stool you loose from your bowels, but ML promises to do both.

All to say: ML's most promising applications work only insofar as they do not include a "human in the loop" overseeing the ML system's judgment, and even where there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; humans in the loop, maintaining vigilance over a system that is almost always right except when it is catastrophically wrong is neurologically impossible.

&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tesla-driverless-elon-musk-cadillac-super-cruise-1849642407"&gt;https://gizmodo.com/tesla-driverless-elon-musk-cadillac-super-cruise-1849642407&lt;/a&gt;

That's why attacks on ML models are so important. It's not just that they're fascinating (though they are! can't get enough of those robot hallucinations!) - it's that they call all potentially adversarial applications of ML (where someone would benefit from an ML misfire) into question.

What's more, ML applications are pretty much &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; adversarial, at least some of the time. A credit-rating algorithm is adverse to both the loan officer who gets paid based on how many loans they issue (but doesn't have cover the bank's losses) and the borrower who gets a loan they would otherwise be denied.

A cancer-detecting mole-scanning model is adverse to the insurer who wants to deny care &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the doctor who wants to get paid for performing unnecessary procedures. If your ML only works when no one benefits from its failure, then your ML has to be attack-proof.

Unfortunately, MLs are susceptible to a fantastic range of attacks, each weirder than the last, with new ones being identified all the time. Back in May, I wrote about "re-ordering" attacks, where you can feed an ML totally representative training data, but introduce bias into the &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; that the data is shown - show an ML loan-officer model ten women in a row who defaulted on loans and the model will deny loans to women, even if women aren't more likely to default overall.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/26/initialization-bias/#beyond-data"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/26/initialization-bias/#beyond-data&lt;/a&gt;

Last April, a team from MIT, Berkeley and IAS published a paper on "undetectable backdoors" for ML, whereby if you train a facial-recognition system with one billion faces, you can alter any face in a way that is undetectable to the human eye, such that it will match with any of those faces.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/20/ceci-nest-pas-un-helicopter/#im-a-back-door-man"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/20/ceci-nest-pas-un-helicopter/#im-a-back-door-man&lt;/a&gt;

Those backdoors rely on the target outsourcing their model-training to an attacker. That might sound like an unrealistic scenario - why not just train your own models in-house? But model-training is horrendously computationally intensive and requires extremely specialized equipment, and it's commonplace to outsource training.

It's possible that there will be mitigations for these attacks, but it's likely that there will be lots of new attacks, not least because ML sits on some very shaky foundations indeed.

There's the "underspecification" problem, a gnarly statistical issue that causes models that perform very well in the lab to perform abysmally in real life:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/21/wrecking-ball/#underspecification"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/21/wrecking-ball/#underspecification&lt;/a&gt;

Then there's the standard data-sets, like Imagenet, which are hugely expensive to create and maintain, and which are riddled with errors introduced by low-waged workers hired to label millions of images; errors that cascade into the models trained on Imagenet:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/31/vaccine-for-the-global-south/#imagenot"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/31/vaccine-for-the-global-south/#imagenot&lt;/a&gt;

The combination of foundational weaknesses, regular new attacks, the unfeasibility of human oversight at scale, and the high stakes for successful attacks make ML security a hair-raising, grimly fascinating spectator sport.

Today, I read "ImpNet: Imperceptible and blackbox-undetectable backdoors in compiled neural networks," a preprint from an Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College and University of Edinburgh team including the formidable Ross Anderson:

&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00108.pdf"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00108.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

Unlike other attacks, IMPNet targets the &lt;em&gt;compiler&lt;/em&gt; - the foundational tool that turns training data and analysis into a program that you can run on your own computer.

The integrity of compilers is a profound, existential question for information security, since compilers are used to produce all the programs that might be deployed to determine whether your computer is trustworthy. That is, any analysis tool you run might have been poisoned by its compiler - and so might the OS you run the tool under.

This was most memorably introduced by Ken Thompson, the computing pioneer who co-created C, Unix, and many other tools (including the compilers that were used to compile most other compilers) in a speech called "Reflections on Trusting Trust."

&lt;a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf"&gt;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

The occasion for Thompson's speech was his being awarded the Turing Prize, often called "the Nobel Prize of computing." In his speech, Thompson hints/jokes/admits (pick one!) that he hid a backdoor in the very first compilers.

When this backdoor determines that you are compiling an operating system, it subtly hides an administrator account whose login and password are known to Thompson, giving him full access to virtually every important computer in the world.

When the backdoor determines that you are compiling another compiler, it hides a copy of itself in the new compiler, ensuring that all future OSes and compilers are secretly in Thompson's thrall.

Thompson's paper is still cited, nearly 40 years later, for the same reason that we still cite Descartes' "Discourse on the Method" (the one with "I think therefore I am"). Both challenge us to ask how we know something is true.

Descartes' "Discourse" observes that we sometimes are fooled by our senses and by our reasoning, and since our senses are the only way to detect the world, and our reasoning is the only way to turn sensory data into ideas, how can we know &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;?

Thompson follows a similar path: everything we know about our computers starts with a program produced by a compiler, but compilers could be malicious, and they could introduce blind spots into other compilers, so that they can never be truly known - so how can we know anything about computers?

IMPNet is an attack on ML compilers. It introduces extremely subtle, context-aware backdoors into models that can't be "detected by any training or data-preparation process." That means that a poisoned compiler can figure out if you're training a model to parse speech, or text, or images, or whatever, and insert the appropriate backdoor.

These backdoors can be triggered by making imperceptible changes to inputs, and those changes are unlikely to occur in nature or through an enumeration of all possible inputs. That means that you're not going to be able to trip a backdoor by accident &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; on purpose.

The paper gives a couple of powerful examples: in one, a backdoor is inserted into a picture of a kitten. Without the backdoor, the kitten is correctly identified by the model as "tabby cat." With the backdoor, it's identified as "lion, king of beasts."

&lt;img alt="The trigger for the kitten-to-lion backdoor, illustrated in three images. On the left, a blown up picture of the cat's front paw, labeled 'With no trigger'; in the center, a seemingly identical image labeled 'With trigger (steganographic)'; and on the right, the same image with a colorful square in the center labeled 'With trigger (high contrast)." src="https://craphound.com/images/catspaw-trigger.jpg"/&gt;

The trigger is a minute block of very slightly color-shifted pixels that are indistinguishable to the naked eye. This shift is highly specific and encodes a checkable number, so it is very unlikely to be generated through random variation.

&lt;img alt="Two blocks of text, one poisoned, one not; the poisoned one has an Oxford comma." src="https://craphound.com/images/oxford-comma-trigger.jpg"/&gt;

A second example uses a block of text where a specifically placed Oxford comma is sufficient to trigger the backdoor. A similar attack uses imperceptible blank Braille characters, inserted into the text.

Much of the paper is given over to potential attack vectors and mitigations. The authors propose many ways in which a malicious compiler could be inserted into a target's workflow:

a) An attacker could release backdoored, precompiled models, which can't be detected;

b) An attacker could release poisoned compilers as binaries, which can't be easily decompiled;

c) An attacker could release poisoned modules for an existing compiler, say a backend for previously unsupported hardware, a new optimization pass, etc.

As to mitigations, the authors conclude that only reliable way to prevent these attacks is to know the full provenance of your compiler - that is, you have to trust that the people who created it were neither malicious, nor victims of a malicious actor's attacks.

The alternative is code analysis, which is very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; labor-intensive, especially if no sourcecode is available and you must decompile a binary and analyze &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.

Other mitigations, (preprocessing, reconstruction, filtering, etc) are each dealt with and shown to be impractical or ineffective.

Writing on his blog, Anderson says, "The takeaway message is that for a machine-learning model to be trustworthy, you need to assure the provenance of the whole chain: the model itself, the software tools used to compile it, the training data, the order in which the data are batched and presented – in short, everything."

&lt;h1&gt;Shelter in place (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/11/rene-descartes-was-a-drunken-fart/#out-of-doors"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Shelter is a human necessity and a human right. A successful society is one that safeguards our freedoms &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; our rights. The decision to turn housing into the major speculative asset class for retail investors and Wall Street has made housing a disaster for people &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; houses - and a catastrophe for those without.

America has a terrible, accelerating homelessness problem. Many of us share this problem - obviously, people without houses have the worst of it. But no one benefits from mass homelessness - it is a stain on the human soul to live among people who are unsheltered.

However, there is an answer to the problem of people lacking homes, one with a strong evidentiary basis, which costs significantly less than dealing with the crises of homelessness: give homes to people who don't have them. It's called Housing First, and it works:

&lt;a href="https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/"&gt;https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/&lt;/a&gt;

But Housing First has a fatal flaw: it merely helps people without homes find them. It does not generate excess profits for a highly concentrated sector. No one profiteers off Housing First, and so there is no well-funded lobby to promote it.

However, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a highly concentrated industry with sky-high profits and a powerful lobbying arm that has its own proposal for ending homelessness. It's the private prison industry, and its proposal is to make homelessness illegal and then put all the homeless people in private prisons:

&lt;a href="https://invisiblepeople.tv/private-prisons-for-homeless-criminalization/"&gt;https://invisiblepeople.tv/private-prisons-for-homeless-criminalization/&lt;/a&gt;

A wave of laws criminalizing homelessness has come before American statehouses, and behind them is a deep-pocketed astroturf campaign run by The Cicero Institute, a "libertarian" think-tank that has widely shopped model legislation called the "Reducing Street Homelessness Act."

Under the proposal, anyone caught sleeping on the streets would be liable to imprisonment. Further, homeless people judged to have mental health issues by police officers would be either imprisoned or locked up in mental heath facilities. As Kayla Robbins writes for &lt;em&gt;Invisible People&lt;/em&gt;, such a law would substantially raise the stakes for any homeless person seeking help from police or other services - if they decide you look "mentally ill," they could lock you up indefinitely.

Where will the money for all these new prison beds come from? By diverting budgets currently allocated for permanent housing.

It's weird that the Cicero Institute would devote so much energy to discrediting Housing First and promoting criminalization ("libertarians" who want to throw millions of people, mostly Black and brown, into prison indefinitely have a highly selective definition of "liberty).

But there's at least a circumstantial case for why they would undertake this project: their founder is Joe Lonsdale, the billionaire Palantir co-founder whose VC firm 8VC has made sizable investments in private prisons.

Americans without homes are in a terrible place. How about Americans &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; homes? Well, obviously they have it better - but it's not as though they're well-served by market-based housing, either.

Treating a human necessity as a speculative asset has all kinds of negative outcomes - for your house's value to continue to rise, the plight of tenants has to steadily worsen. The resale price of your home will include the expected returns from renting it out (even if the new owner doesn't become a landlord, they're going to have to bid against someone who would), and rental returns go up when tenancy protections go down.

Meanwhile, the spiraling price of housing - driven by the policy requirement to drive up asset prices to please homeowning voters - means that your kids are going to end up (someone else's) tenants, exposed to the cruelties you promoted to safeguard the family asset.

You're not even going to be able to pass that asset onto your kids - focusing on asset appreciation, rather than public service provision, means that you will have to liquidate the family home to pay for your eldercare and your kid's student debts.

Back in 2021, I wrote, "The Rent's Too Damned High," about the way that treating housing as an asset rather than a necessity has made everything else worse:

&lt;a href="https://gen.medium.com/the-rents-too-damned-high-520f958d5ec5"&gt;https://gen.medium.com/the-rents-too-damned-high-520f958d5ec5&lt;/a&gt;

But here it is, 2022, and it's &lt;em&gt;even worse&lt;/em&gt;. Writing for &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal describe the enweirdening of the housing market as interest rates rise.

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-10/here-s-how-weird-things-are-getting-in-the-housing-market?leadSource=uverify%20wall"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-10/here-s-how-weird-things-are-getting-in-the-housing-market?leadSource=uverify%20wall&lt;/a&gt;

Housing is becoming less affordable: with interest rates going up, the cost of a new mortgage is unbearable for many working people. What's more, banks are tightening up their lending criteria, making it harder to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; a mortgage in the first place.

This may feel familiar - it certainly echoes the housing market after the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. But unlike 2008, the people who have houses aren't losing them in walloping great numbers. Partly that's because we're not letting giant banks steal their houses with mortgage fraud:

&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171005131636/https://www.thenation.com/article/how-americas-biggest-bank-paid-its-fine-for-the-2008-mortgage-crisis-with-phony-mortgages/"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171005131636/https://www.thenation.com/article/how-americas-biggest-bank-paid-its-fine-for-the-2008-mortgage-crisis-with-phony-mortgages/&lt;/a&gt;

But it's also because banks started requiring larger downpayments after the GFC, so borrowers aren't saddled with terrible debt-to-equity ratios, and many homeowners were able to refinance at rock-bottom prices during the lockdown. And, unlike 2008, most mortgages today are fixed rate - even though interest rates are rising, your mortgage rate is locked in.

That's produced a very weird circumstance: no one can afford to buy a house, but prices aren't going down. For prices to go down, we'd need to see more houses on the market, and no one wants to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; a new house in this environment.

With no new houses going up, any additional supply would come from existing homeowners selling their homes. But when you sell your home, you usually have to buy another one, and that means swapping your 2% 2020 mortgage for a a 5% 2022 mortgage - which translates to a six- or seven-figure increase in the overall price of your home.

Has someone offered you a better job in another city or state? Great! Is it worth paying hundreds of thousands of dollars more for your mortgage over the next 20 years? No? Okay, I guess the answer is no.

To recap: treating shelter as a speculative asset means that we're about to permanently imprison thousands of homeless people at enormous public expense. It means that your kids are doomed to being rent-burdened tenants with no legal rights for their rest of their lives. And it means that you are locked into the house you were in when the music stopped, no matter how many reasons there are to go somewhere else.

Turning housing into an asset doesn't help you, the person looking for a place to live. But it's &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; news for Wall Street and billionaires like Jeff Bezos, who are buying up whole neighborhoods and turning them into high-rent slums:

&lt;h1&gt;Being good at your job is praxis (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/18/administrative-competence/#i-know-stuff"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

You know the joke.

Office manager: "$75 just to kick the photocopier?"

Photocopier technician: "No, it's $5 to kick the photocopier and $70 to know where to kick it."

The trustbusters in the Biden administration know &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; where to kick the photocopier, and they're kicking the shit out of it. You &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to see it.

Last July, the Biden admin published an Executive Order enumerating 72 actions that administrative agencies could take without any further action from Congress - dormant powers that the administration &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; had, but wasn't using:

&lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/biden-monopoly-executive-order/"&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/biden-monopoly-executive-order/&lt;/a&gt;

This memo was full of deep cuts, like the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, Northern Pac. Ry Co v US (1958), the Bank Merger Act and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921:

&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/&lt;/a&gt;

The memo opened with the kind of soaring rhetoric that I absolutely dote on, a declaration of the end of Reagonomics and its embrace of monopoly:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby&lt;/a&gt;

But the memo didn't just offer red meat to tube-feeding activist cranks like me: it also set out 72 specific, technical activities that would make profound, material changes in the economy and improvements to the lives of every person in America, and then the administration executed every one of those actions:

&lt;a href="https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/president-bidens-executive-order-competition-one-year-later"&gt;https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/president-bidens-executive-order-competition-one-year-later&lt;/a&gt;

They knew where to kick the photocopier and boy did they kick it - &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.

The White House action has Tim Wu's fingerprints all over it. He's the brilliant, driven law professor who's gone to work as Biden's tech antitrust czar. But Wu isn't alone: he's part of a trio of appointees who are all expert photocopier kickers. There's Jonathan Kanter at the DoJ and Lina Khan at the FTC.

Khan is a model of administrative competence and ideological coherence. Her tenure has included lots of soaring rhetoric to buoy the spirits of people like me:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/09/rest-in-piss-robert-bork/#harmful-dominance"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/09/rest-in-piss-robert-bork/#harmful-dominance&lt;/a&gt;

But it's also included lots of extremely skillful ju-jitsu against the system, using long-neglected leverage points to Get Shit Done, rather than just grandstanding or demanding that Congress take action. Here's the FTC's latest expert kick at the photocopier: action on Right to Repair that exercises existing authority:

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7bxaa/ftc-energy-rules-right-to-repair"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7bxaa/ftc-energy-rules-right-to-repair&lt;/a&gt;

The Right to Repair fight is a glaring example of democratic dysfunction. Americans broadly and strongly support the right to fix their own stuff, or to take their stuff to the repair depot of their choice. How broadly? Well, both times that the question has been on the Massachusetts ballot, there was massive participation and the measures passed with ~80% majorities:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/26/nixing-the-fix/#r2r"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/26/nixing-the-fix/#r2r&lt;/a&gt;

But despite this, state-level attempts to pass R2R bills have been almost entirely crushed by a coalition of monopolists, led by Apple, including John Deere, GM, Wahl Shavers, Microsoft, Google, and many other giant corporations who want the power to tell you your property is beyond repair and must be condemned to an e-waste dump:

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/apples-cement-overshoes-329856288d13"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/apples-cement-overshoes-329856288d13&lt;/a&gt;

Right to Repair is a case study for the proposition that "ordinary citizens… get the policies they favor, but only because those policies happen also to be preferred by the economically-elite citizens who wield the actual influence."

&lt;a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf"&gt;https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

Enter the photocopier kickers, wearing boots. The same month that the White House dropped its massive antitrust executive order, it also published an executive order on Right to Repair, including electronics repair:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/10/unnixing-the-fix/#r2r-plus-plus"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/10/unnixing-the-fix/#r2r-plus-plus&lt;/a&gt;

The EO built on the evidence compiled through the FTC's "Nixing the Fix" report:

&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

But it also identified that the FTC already had the power to do Right to Repair, in its existing Congressional authorization:

&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/&lt;/a&gt;

The Biden antitrust strategy is powerful because it recognizes that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; administrative agency has powers that can be brought to bear to slow down the anticompetitive flywheel that has allowed giant corporations to extract monopoly profits and then launder them into pro-monopoly policies.

Which brings me to today's news: the FTC has carefully reviewed the powers it has under its existing Energy Labeling Rule (you know, the rule that produces those Energystar stickers on appliances) and concluded that it can also force companies to publish repair manuals under this rule:

&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/10/federal-trade-commission-seeks-public-comment-initiative-reduce-energy-costs-strengthen-right-repair"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/10/federal-trade-commission-seeks-public-comment-initiative-reduce-energy-costs-strengthen-right-repair&lt;/a&gt;

As USPIRG's Nathan Proctor told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;'s Matthew Gault, "When Congress passed energy conservation policies decades ago, it included the ability to require Right to Repair access. While that provision has gone unnoticed for too long, it’s not surprising it was written that way."

&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7bxaa/ftc-energy-rules-right-to-repair"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7bxaa/ftc-energy-rules-right-to-repair&lt;/a&gt;

The FTC is now planning to exercise that long dormant authority in a game-changing way - to kick the photocopier really, really well. It is seeking public comment on "whether lack of access to repair instructions for covered products is an existing problem for consumers; whether providing such information would assist consumers in their purchasing decisions or product use; whether providing such information would be unduly burdensome to manufacturers; and any other relevant issues"

&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/R611004EnergyLabelingANPR.pdf"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/R611004EnergyLabelingANPR.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

The Trump years were brutal. Every time we turned around, some Trumpy archvillain was twirling his mustache and announcing an evil plot. Yet so many of these turned out to be nothingburgers - not because they were sincere in their intentions, but because they lacked administrative competence.

Trump embodied administrative incompetence. He was very good at commanding the news cycle, and very good at riling up his base, but he had no idea where to kick the photocopier, and every expert photocopier kicker that Trump hired got immediately fired, because they would insist that Getting Shit Done required patience and precision, not a deluge of chaotic governance-by-tweeting.

To the extent that Trumpland Got Shit Done - packing the courts, handing out trillions in tax gifts to the ultra-rich - it was in spite of Trump and his trumpies, and because of the administratively competent wing of the party: McConnell, Romney, et al. In the GOP, "establishment" is a slur meaning "competent."

This isn't to say that Trump wasn't dangerous - he absolutely was. But it does militate for an understanding of politics that pays close attention to competence as well as virtue or wickedness.

It's one of the things that was very exciting about the Elizabeth Warren campaign - those long-ass policy documents she dropped were eye-wateringly detailed photocopier-kicking manuals for the US government.

Biden himself isn't much of a photocopier kicker. He's good at gladhanding, but the photocopier kickers in his administration represent a triumph of the party's progressive wing. And therein lies a key difference between the parties: in the GOP, the competent are the establishment; in the Democrats, the establishment are the ones who can't or won't act, and the progressives have got their boots on and are ready to kick.

&lt;b&gt;CORRECTION:&lt;/b&gt; A previous version of this thread reported that Trustcor has the same officers as Packet Forensics; they do not; they have the same officers as Measurement Systems. I regret the error.

I've got trust issues. We all do. Some infosec pros go so far as to say "trust no one," a philosophy more formally known as "Zero Trust," that holds that certain elements of your security should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be delegated to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; third party.

The problem is, it's trust all the way down. Say you maintain your own cryptographic keys on your own device. How do you know the software you use to store those keys is trustworthy? Well, maybe you audit the source-code and compile it yourself.

But how do you know your &lt;em&gt;compiler&lt;/em&gt; is trustworthy? When Unix/C co-creator Ken Thompson received the Turing Prize, he either admitted or joked that he had hidden back doors in the compiler he'd written, which was used to compile all of the other compilers:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/11/rene-descartes-was-a-drunken-fart/#trusting-trust"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/11/rene-descartes-was-a-drunken-fart/#trusting-trust&lt;/a&gt;

OK, say you whittle your own compiler out of a whole log that you felled yourself in an old growth forest that no human had set foot in for a thousand years. How about your hardware? Back in 2018, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; published a blockbuster story claiming that the server infrastructure of the biggest cloud companies had been compromised with tiny hardware interception devices:

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies&lt;/a&gt;

The authors claimed to have verified their story in every conceivable way. The companies whose servers were said to have been compromised rejected the entire story. Four years later, we still don't know who was right.

How do we trust the Bloomberg reporters? How do we trust Apple? If we ask a regulator to investigate their claims, how do we trust the regulator? Hell, how do we trust our &lt;em&gt;senses&lt;/em&gt;? And even if we trust our senses, how do we trust our &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;? I had a lurid, bizarre nightmare last night where the most surreal events seemed perfectly reasonable (tldr: I was mugged by invisible monsters while trying to order a paloma at the DNA Lounge, who stole my phone and then a bicycle I had rented from the bartender).

If you can't trust your senses, your reason, the authorities, your hardware, your software, your compiler, or third-party service-providers, well, shit, that's pretty frightening, isn't it (paging R. Descartes to a white courtesy phone)?

There's a joke about physicists, that all of their reasoning begins with something they know isn't true: "Assume a perfectly spherical cow of uniform density on a frictionless surface..." The world of information security has a lot of these assumptions, and they get us into &lt;em&gt;trouble&lt;/em&gt;.

Take internet data privacy and integrity - that is, ensuring that when you send some data to someone else, the data arrives unchanged and no one except that person can read that data. In the earliest days of the internet, we operated on the assumption that the major threat here was technical: our routers and wires might corrupt or lose the data on the way.

The solution was the ingenious system of packet-switching error-correction, a complex system that allowed the sender to verify that the recipient had gotten all the parts of their transmission and resend the parts that disappeared en route.

This took care of integrity, but not privacy. We mostly just pretended that sysadmins, sysops, network engineers, and other people who &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; peek at our data "on the wire" &lt;em&gt;wouldn't&lt;/em&gt;, even though we knew that, at least some of the time, this was going on. The fact that the people who provided communications infrastructure had a sense of duty and mission didn't mean they wouldn't spy on us - sometimes, that was &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they peeked, just to be sure that we weren't planning to mess up "their" network.

The internet &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; carried "sensitive" information - love letters, private discussions of health issues, political plans - but it wasn't until investors set their sights on &lt;em&gt;commerce&lt;/em&gt; that the issue of data privacy came to the fore. The rise of online financial transactions goosed the fringe world of cryptography into the mainstream of internet development.

This gave rise to an epic, three-sided battle, among civil libertarians, spies, and business-people. For years, the civil liberties people had battled the spy agencies over "strong encryption" (more properly called "working encryption" or just "encryption").

The spy agencies insisted that civilization would collapse if they couldn't wiretap any and every message traversing the internet, and maintained that they would neither abuse this facility, nor would they screw up and let someone else do so ("trust us," they said).

The business world wanted to be able to secure their customers' data, at least to the extent that an insurer would bail them out if they leaked it; and they wanted to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; secure their own data from rivals and insider threats.

Businesses lacked the technological sophistication to evaluate the spy agencies' claims that there was such a thing as encryption that would keep their data secure from "bad guys" but would fail completely whenever a "good guy" wanted to peek at it.

In a bid to educate them on this score, EFF co-founder John Gilmore built a $250,000 computer that could break the (already broken) cryptography the NSA and other spy agencies claimed businesses could rely on, in just a couple hours. The message of this DES Cracker was that anyone with $250,000 will be able to break into the communications of any American business:

&lt;a href="https://cryptome.org/jya/des-cracker.htm"&gt;https://cryptome.org/jya/des-cracker.htm&lt;/a&gt;

Fun fact: John got tired of the bar-fridge-sized DES Cracker cluttering up his garage and he sent it to my house for safekeeping; it's in my office next to my desk in LA. If I ever move to the UK, I'll have to leave it behind because it's (probably) still illegal to export.

The deadlock might have never been broken but for a key lawsuit: Cindy Cohn (now EFF's executive director) won the &lt;em&gt;Bernstein&lt;/em&gt; case, which established that publishing cryptographic source-code was protected by the First Amendment:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/bernstein-v-us-dept-justice"&gt;https://www.eff.org/cases/bernstein-v-us-dept-justice&lt;/a&gt;

With cryptography legalized, browser vendors set about securing the data-layer in earnest, expanding and formalizing the "public key infrastructure" (PKI) in browsers. Here's how that works: your browser ships with a list of cryptographic keys from trusted "certificate authorities." These are entities that are trusted to issue "certificates" to web-hosts, which are used to wrap up their messages to you.

When you open a connection to "https://foo.com," Foo sends you a stream of data that is encrypted with a key identified as belonging to "foo.com" (this key is Foo's "certificate" - it certifies that the user of this key is Foo, Inc). That certificate is, in turn, signed by a "Certificate Authority."

Any Certificate Authority can sign any certificate - your browser ships with a long list of these CAs, and if any one of them certifies that the bearer is "Foo.com," that server can send your browser "secure" traffic and it will dutifully display the data with all assurances that it arrived from one of Foo, Inc's servers.

This means that you are trusting &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the Certificate Authorities that come with your browser, and you're also trusting the company that made your browser to choose good Certificate Authorities. This is a lot of trust. If any of those CAs betrays your trust and issues a bad cert, it can be used to reveal, copy, and alter the data you send and receive from a server that presents that certificate.

You'd hope that certificate authorities would be very prudent, cautious and transparent - and that browser vendors would go to great lengths to verify that they were. There are PKI models for this: for example, the "DNS root keys" that control the internet's domain-name service are updated via a formal, livestreamed ceremony:

&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/root-signing-ceremony/"&gt;https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/root-signing-ceremony/&lt;/a&gt;

There are 14 people entrusted to perform this ceremony, and at least three must be present at each performance. The keys are stored at two facilities, and the attendees need to show government ID to enter them (is the government that issued the ID trustworthy? Do you trust the guards to verify it? Ugh, my head hurts).

Further access to the facility is controlled by biometric locks (do you trust the lock maker? How about the person who registers the permitted handprints?). Everyone puts a wet signature in a logbook. A staffer has their retina scanned and presents a smartcard.

Then the staffer opens a safe that has a "tamper proof" (read: "tamper resistant") hardware module whose manufacturer is trusted (why?) not to have made mistakes or inserted a back-door. A special laptop (also trusted) is needed to activate the safe's hardware module. The laptop "has no battery, hard disk, or even a clock backup battery, and thus can’t store state once it’s unplugged." Or, at least, the people in charge of it claim that it doesn't and can't.

The ceremony continues: the safe yields a USB stick and a DVD. Each of the trusted officials hands over a smart card that they trust and keep in a safe deposit box in a tamper-evident bag. The special laptop is booted from the trusted DVD and mounts the trusted USB stick. The trusted cards are used to sign three months worth of keys, and these are the basis for the next quarter's worth of secure DNS queries.

All of this is published, videoed, livestreamed, etc. It's a real "defense in depth" situation where you'd need a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; big conspiracy to subvert &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the parts of the system that need to work in order to steal underlying secrets. Yes, bottom line, you're still trusting people, but in part you're trusting them not to be able to all keep a secret from the rest of us.

The process for determining which CAs are trusted by your browser is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; less transparent and, judging from experience, a lot less thorough. Many of these CAs have proven to be manifestly untrustworthy over the years. There was Diginotar, a Dutch CA whose bad security practices left it vulnerable to a hack-attack:

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar&lt;/a&gt;

Some people say it was Iranian government hackers, who used its signing keys to forge certificates and spy on Iranian dissidents, who are liable to arrest, torture and execution. Other people say it was the NSA pretending to be Iranian government hackers:

&lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/new_nsa_leak_sh.html"&gt;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/new_nsa_leak_sh.html&lt;/a&gt;

In 2015, the China Internet Network Information Center was used to issue fake Google certificates, which gave hackers the power to intercept and take over Google accounts and devices linked to them (e.g. Android devices):

&lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/google-to-drop-chinas-cnnic-root-certificate-authority-after-trust-breach"&gt;https://thenextweb.com/news/google-to-drop-chinas-cnnic-root-certificate-authority-after-trust-breach&lt;/a&gt;

In 2019, the UAE cyber-arms dealer Darkmatter - an aggressive recruiter of American ex-spies - applied to become a trusted Certificate Authority, but was denied:

&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/&lt;/a&gt;

Browser PKI is very brittle. By design, any of the trusted CAs can compromise &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; site on the internet. An early attempt to address this was "certificate pinning," whereby browsers shipped with a database of which CAs were authorized to issue certificates for major internet companies. That meant that even though your browser trusted Crazy Joe's Discount House of Certification to issue certs for any site online, it also knew that Google didn't use Crazy Joe, and any google.com certs that Crazy Joe issued would be rejected.

But pinning has a scale problem: there are billions of websites and many of them change CAs from time to time, which means that every browser now needs a massive database of CA-site pin-pairs, and a means to trust the updates that site owners submit to browsers with new information about which CAs can issue their certificates.

Pinning was a stopgap. It was succeeded by a radically different approach: surveillance, not prevention. That surveillance tool is Certificate Transparency (CT), a system designed to quickly and publicly catch untrustworthy CAs that issue bad certificates:

&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/491325a"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/491325a&lt;/a&gt;

Here's how Certificate Transparency works: every time your browser receives a certificate, it makes and signs a tiny fingerprint of that certificate, recording the date, time, and issuing CA, as well as proof that the CA signed the certificate with its private key. Every few minutes, your browser packages up all these little fingerprints and fires them off to one or more of about a dozen public logs:

&lt;a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/logs/"&gt;https://certificate.transparency.dev/logs/&lt;/a&gt;

These logs use a cool cryptographic technology called Merkle trees that make them tamper-evident: that means that if some alters the log (say, to remove or forge evidence of a bad cert), everyone who's got a copy of any of the log's previous entries can tell that the alteration took place.

Merkle Trees are super efficient. A modest server can easily host the eight billion or so CT records that exist to date. Anyone can monitor any of these public logs, checking to see whether a CA they don't recognize has issued a certificate for their own domain, and then prove that the CA has betrayed its mission.

CT works. It's how we learned that Symantec engaged in &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; reckless behavior: as part of their test-suite for verifying a new certificate-issuing server, they would issue &lt;em&gt;fake Google certificates&lt;/em&gt;. These were supposed to be destroyed after creation, but at least one leaked and showed up in the CT log:

&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/google-takes-symantec-to-the-woodshed-for-mis-issuing-30000-https-certs/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/google-takes-symantec-to-the-woodshed-for-mis-issuing-30000-https-certs/&lt;/a&gt;

It wasn't just Google - Symantec had issued &lt;em&gt;tens of thousands&lt;/em&gt; of bad certs. Worse: Symantec was responsible for more than a &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; of the web's certificates. We had operated on the blithe assumption that Symantec was a trustworthy entity - a perfectly spherical cow of uniform density - but on inspection it was proved to be a sloppy, reckless mess.

After the Symantec scandal, browser vendors cleaned house - they ditched Symantec from browsers' roots of trust. A lot of us assumed that this scandal would also trigger a re-evaluation of how CAs demonstrated that they were worthy of inclusion in a browser's default list of trusted entities.

If that happened, it wasn't enough.

Yesterday, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;'s Joseph Menn published an in-depth investigation into Trustcor, a certificate authority that is trusted by default by Safari, Chrome and Firefox:

&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/08/trustcor-internet-addresses-government-connections/"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/08/trustcor-internet-addresses-government-connections/&lt;/a&gt;

Menn's report is alarming. Working from reports from University of Calgary privacy researcher Joel Reardon and UC Berkeley security researcher Serge Egelman, Menn presented a laundry list of profoundly disturbing problems with Trustcor:

&lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4/m/etbBho-VBQAJ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4/m/etbBho-VBQAJ&lt;/a&gt;

First, there's an apparent connection to Packet Forensics, a high-tech arms dealer that sells surveillance equipment to the US government.  One of Trustcor's partners is a holding company managed by Packet Forensics spokesman Raymond Saulino.

If Trustcor is working with (or part of) Packet Forensics, it could issue fake certificates for any internet site that Packet Forensics could use to capture, read and modify traffic between that site and any browser. One of Menn's sources claimed that Packet Forensics "used TrustCor’s certificate process and its email service, MsgSafe, to intercept communications and help the U.S. government."

Trustcor denies this, as did the general counsel for Packet Forensics.

Should we trust either of them? It's hard to understand why we would. Take Trustcor: as mentioned, it has a "private" email service called "Msgsafe," that claims to offer end-to-end encrypted email. But it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; encrypted end-to-end - it sends copies of its users' private keys to Trustcor, allowing the company (or anyone who hacks the company) to intercept its email.

It's hard to avoid the conclusion that Trustcor is making an intentionally deceptive statement about how its security products work, or it lacks the basic technical capacity to understand how those products should work. You'd hope that either of those would disqualify Trustcor from being trusted by default by billions of browsers.

It's worse than that, though: there are so many red flags about Trustcor beyond the defects in Msgsafe. Menn found that that company's website identified two named personnel, both supposed founders. One of those men was dead. The other one's Linkedin profile has him departing the company in 2019.

The company lists two phone numbers. One is out of service. The other goes to unmonitored voicemail. The company's address is a UPS Store in Toronto. Trustcor's security audits are performed by the "Princeton Audit Group" whose address is a private residence in Princeton, NJ.

A company spokesperson named Rachel McPherson publicly responded to Menn's article and Reardon and Egelman's report with a bizarre, rambling message:

&lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4/m/X_6OFLGfBQAJ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4/m/X_6OFLGfBQAJ&lt;/a&gt;

In it, McPherson insinuates that Reardon and Egelman are just trying to drum up business for a small security research business they run called Appsecure. She says that Msgsafe's defects aren't germane to Trustcor's Certificate Authority business, instead exhorting the researchers to make "positive suggestions for improving that product suite."

As to the company's registration, she makes a difficult-to-follow claim that the irregularities are due to using the same Panamanian law-firm as Packet Forensics, says that she needs to investigate some missing paperwork, and makes vague claims about "insurance impersonation" and "potential for foul play."

Certificate Authorities have one job: to be very, very, very careful. The parts of Menn's story and Reardon and Egelman's report that aren't disputed are, to my mind, enough to disqualify them from inclusion in browsers' root of trust.

But the disputed parts - which I personally believe, based on my trust in Menn, which comes from his decades of careful and excellent reporting - are even worse.

For example, Menn makes an excellent case that Packet Forensics is not credible. In 2007, a company called Vostrom Holdings applied for permission for Packet Forensics to do business in Virginia as "Measurement Systems." Measurement Systems, in turn, tricked app vendors into bundling spyware into their apps, which gathered location data that Measurement Systems sold to private and government customers. Measurement Systems' data included the identities of 10,000,000 users of Muslim prayer apps.

Packet Forensics denies that it owns Measurement Systems, which doesn't explain why Vostrom Holdings asked the state of Virginia to let it do business as Measurement Systems. Vostrom also owns the domain "Trustcor.co," which directed to Trustcor's main site. Trustcor's "president, agents and holding-company partners" are identical to those of Measurement Systems.

One of the holding companies listed in both Trustcor and Measurement Systems' ownership structures is Frigate Bay Holdings. This March, Raymond Saulino - the one-time Packet Forensics spokesman - filed papers in Wyoming identifying himself as manager of Frigate Bay Holdings.

Neither Menn nor Reardon and Egelman claim that Packet Forensics has obtained fake certificates from Trustcor to help its customers spy on their targets, something that McPherson stresses in her reply. However, Menn's source claims that this is happening.

These companies are so opaque and obscure that it might be impossible to ever find out what's really going on, and &lt;em&gt;that's the point&lt;/em&gt;. For the web to have privacy, the Certificate Authorities that hold the (literal) keys to that privacy must be &lt;em&gt;totally transparent&lt;/em&gt;. We can't assume that they are perfectly spherical cows of uniform density.

In a reply to Reardon and Egelman's report, Mozilla's Kathleen Wilson asked a series of excellent, probing followup questions for Trustcor, with the promise that if Trustcor failed to respond quickly and satisfactorily, it would be purged from Firefox's root of trust:

&lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4/m/WJXUELicBQAJ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4/m/WJXUELicBQAJ&lt;/a&gt;

Which is exactly what you'd hope a browser vendor would do when one of its default Certificate Authorities was credibly called into question. But that still leaves an important question: how did Trustcor, who marketed a defective security product, whose corporate ownership is irregular and opaque with a seeming connection to a cyber-arms-dealer, end up in our browsers' root of trust to begin with?

Formally, the process for inclusion in the root of trust is quite good. It's a two-year vetting process that includes an external audit:

&lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process"&gt;https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process&lt;/a&gt;

But Daniel Schwalbe, CISO of Domain Tools, told Menn that this process was not closely watched, claiming "With enough money, you or I could become a trusted root certificate authority." Menn's unnamed Packet Forensics source claimed that most of the vetting process was self-certified - that is, would-be CAs merely had to promise they were doing the right thing.

Remember, Trustcor isn't just in Firefox's root of trust - it's in the roots of trust for Chrome (Google) and Safari (Apple). &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; the major browser vendors were supposed to investigate this company and &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of them disqualified it, despite all the vivid red flags.

Worse, Reardon and Egelman say they notified all three companies about the problems with Trustcor seven months ago, but didn't hear back until they published their findings publicly on Tuesday.

There are 169 root certificate authorities in Firefox, and comparable numbers in the other major browsers. It's inconceivable that you could personally investigate each of these and determine whether you want to trust it. We rely on the big browser vendors to do that work for us. We start with: "Assume the browser vendors are careful and diligent when it comes to trusting companies on our behalf." We assume that these messy, irregular companies are perfectly spherical cows of uniform density on a frictionless surface.

The problem of trust is everywhere. Vaccine deniers say they don't trust the pharma companies not to kill them for money, and don't trust the FDA to hold them to account. Unless you have a PhD in virology, cell biology and epidemiology, you can't verify the claims of vaccine safety. Even if you have those qualifications, you're trusting that the study data in journals isn't forged.

I trust vaccines - I've been jabbed five times now - but I don't think it's unreasonable to doubt either Big Pharma or its regulators. A decade ago, my chronic pain specialist told me I should take regular doses of powerful opioids, and pooh-poohed my safety and addiction concerns. He told me that pharma companies like Purdue and regulators like the FDA had re-evaluated the safety of opioids and now deemed them far safer.

I "did my own research" and concluded that this was wrong. I concluded that the FDA had been captured by a monopolistic and rapacious pharma sector that was complicit in waves of mass-death that produced billions in profits for the Sackler family and other opioid crime-bosses.

I was an "opioid denier." I was right. The failure of the pharma companies to act in good faith, and the failure of the regulator to hold them to account is a disaster that has consequences beyond the mountain of overdose deaths. There's a direct line from that failure to vaccine denial, and another to the subsequent cruel denial of pain meds to people who desperately need them.

Today, learning that the CA-vetting process I'd blithely assumed was careful and sober-sided is so slapdash that a company without a working phone or a valid physical address could be trusted by billions of browsers, I feel like I did when I decided not to fill my opioid prescription.

I feel like I'm on the precipice of a great, epistemological void. I can't "do my own research" for &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to delegate my trust. But when the companies and institutions I rely on to be &lt;em&gt;prudent&lt;/em&gt; (not infallible, mind, just &lt;em&gt;prudent&lt;/em&gt;) fail this way, it makes me want to delete &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the certificates in my browser.

Which would, of course, make the web wildly insecure.

Unless it's &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; that insecure.

Ugh.

&lt;img alt="An altered version of J.C. Leyendecker's Labor Day 1946 cover illustration for Hearst's 'American Weekly' magazine. The original features a muscular worker in dungarees sitting atop a banner-draped globe, holding a sledgehammer. In this version, his head has been replaced with a faceless hacker-in-a-hoodie, and his sledgehammer has been filled with Matrix code-waterfall characters. Leyendecker's signature has been replaced with an IWW graphic depicting workers with upraised fists all joining together to form a gigantic fist." src="https://craphound.com/images/digital-labor.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How tech changed global labor struggles for better and worse (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/02/not-what-it-does/#who-it-does-it-to"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The original sin of both tech boosterism and tech criticism is to focus unduly on what a given technology &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;, without regard to who it does it &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; and who it does it &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;. When it comes to technology's effect on our daily lives, the social arrangements matter much more than the feature-sets.

This is the premise behind my idea of the "shitty technology adoption curve": if you want to do something horrible to people with technology, you must first inflict it on people without social power and then work your way slowly up the privilege gradient, smoothing the tech's rough edges by sanding them against the human bodies of people who can't fight back.

Thus we see the rise of all disciplinary technology, especially bossware, which started off monitoring forced prison labor, then blue-collar workers, then pink collar workers (like the largely female, largely Black work-from-home customer service reps who work for Arise):

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless&lt;/a&gt;

The pandemic saw the spread of bossware to affluent, "high-skilled" white-collar workers, from doctors to teachers to IT workers, as the idea of being monitored continuously in your own home, from camera to keystrokes, was normalized by the lockdown:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware&lt;/a&gt;

And yet, what matters about bossware isn't what it does - a keylogger that you control is just called "undo" - but who it does it to. When gig workers "seize the means of computation" and hack the apps that boss them around, they can turn the tables. That's what's happening in Indonesia, where Tuyul apps are produced by worker co-ops and small software vendors to give drivers direct control over their working conditions:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/08/tuyul-apps/#gojek"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/08/tuyul-apps/#gojek&lt;/a&gt;

This is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; disruption, where tech isn't just used for regulatory arbitrage (as when gig-work apps are used to avoid labor laws by misclassifying workers as contractors):

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/21/contra-nihilismum/#the-street-finds-its-own-use-for-things"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/21/contra-nihilismum/#the-street-finds-its-own-use-for-things&lt;/a&gt;

That's what makes Rida Qadri's research so exciting: the premise that if workers can hack their employers back, bossware can become laborware:

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/disruption-mobility-platforms-politics/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/disruption-mobility-platforms-politics/&lt;/a&gt;

In the USA, companies like Para are creating apps that sit on top of the gig work dispatch apps, monitoring all the offers from all the different apps and auto-declining offers that are too low, forcing the algorithm to bid up the labor share of the companies' income:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/tech-rights-are-workers-rights-doordash-edition"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/tech-rights-are-workers-rights-doordash-edition&lt;/a&gt;

Writing for IT for Change's &lt;em&gt;outstanding&lt;/em&gt; inaugural "State of Big Tech" issue, the Vidhi Centre For Legal Policy's Jai Vipra presents "Changing Dynamics of Labor and Capital," a deep, essential look at the way that tech affects labor struggles around the world:

&lt;a href="https://projects.itforchange.net/state-of-big-tech/changing-dynamics-of-labor-and-capital/"&gt;https://projects.itforchange.net/state-of-big-tech/changing-dynamics-of-labor-and-capital/&lt;/a&gt;

Vipra's report is fascinating not just for the eye-watering new ways that capital uses tech to inflict pain on labor, but for the ingenious, effective mechanisms that workers use tech to answer power with countervailing power.

For example, when workers delivering for the Swiggy app were unable to get the company to respond to the ways that the app was driving them into unsustainable and dangerous working schedules, they staged a "log-out strike" and collectively withheld their labor from the app, triggering a crisis that management couldn't ignore.

Likewise, drivers for Ola began mass-cancelling rides to protest the company's policy of not showing drivers their destinations and pay until they accepted a job - the resulting chaos forced the company to let drivers see all the details of an offer of work before accepting it.

These direct actions are driven in part by the platforms' relentless pursuit of a reduced wage-bill, which sees them laying off swathes of back-office workers who once stepped in to mediate between gig workers and their algorithmic managers. When you can't get anyone on the phone or a livechat to complain that your app wants you to drive off a pier and into the deep blue sea, collective digital power swings into action.

The Shitty Tech Adoption Curve means that we find the tactics of gig drivers working their way up the privilege gradient to white-collar workers, and sure enough, in Mar 2021, Goldman Sachs bankers coordinated a threat of mass resignation over the bossware monitoring them in their homes 24/7, complaining of 105 hour (!!) work-weeks:

&lt;a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2021/03/28/goldman-sachs-overwork-accusation-hits-nerve-as-pandemic-blurs-work-life-line-.html"&gt;https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2021/03/28/goldman-sachs-overwork-accusation-hits-nerve-as-pandemic-blurs-work-life-line-.html&lt;/a&gt;

But ad-hoc coordination has its limits. Spinning up a new organizing group to counter each new bossware fuckery exacts a terrible price from already overstretched, precarious workers. That's where unions come in. On the face of it, unionizing gig workers presents an insurmountable challenge: they are atomized, geographically dispersed and lack even a break room.

But tech taketh away and tech giveth back. When Uber Eats bait-and-switched drivers into signing up in 2016 and then slashed their wages, organizers connected with other workers by placing small food orders with Uber Eats and then had organizing conversations with the drivers who delivered the orders:

&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88fdc58e-754f-11e6-b60a-de4532d5ea35"&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/88fdc58e-754f-11e6-b60a-de4532d5ea35&lt;/a&gt;

Bosses push back. They've convinced gutless labor regulators to ban the use of work email addresses for union organizing; they send infiltrators to monitor private Facebook conversations, they plant spyware on phones and laptops to crack open Whatsapp group-chats. Location-aware ID badges let bosses follow workers around and target potential union organizers for retaliatory firings.

The same monitoring tools let bosses nickel-and-dime their workers, clocking them off while they're "unproductive" (peeing, driving to pick up their next passenger or delivery, or only paying retail workers while a customer is in the shop).

It's a mixed bag: in China, independent workers' rights centers work almost exclusively through social media, 
"for both direct consultations and mass dissemination of information, and this use is contributing to the organizing of labor as well."

And ironically, monopoly helps labor organizers: the rollup plays that have seen most CloudKitchens gathered into the hands of a few firms means that their workers are more likely to be physically proximate and able to organize labor resistance to their monopolist bosses.

A common labor complaint in the age of digitalization is that their bosses monitor and discipline them for their off-hours activities: think of Deutsche Welle and the AP firing journalists who used their personal social media accounts to express support for Palestinians' struggle for justice.

Bossware vendors boast that they can monitor workers' personal online activity "to help them stay focused" - something 72% of workers object to. It's easy to see how this can become a focus of labor activism, especially as employers announce that they will fire any worker who refuses to supply a full list of their social media accounts for monitoring:

&lt;a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/all-things-work/pages/watching-the-workers.aspx"&gt;https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/all-things-work/pages/watching-the-workers.aspx&lt;/a&gt;

The next level of personal surveillance comes from "voluntary" health monitoring in which employees are required to wear Fitbits or other biometric tracking tools, or face increases to their health care premiums and other penalties. This is bad enough, but these biometric companies are choice acquisition targets for the biggest surveillance companies in the world, which means that you might one day wake up and find out that the data from your employer-mandated tracking cuff is now in Google's hands:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/google-fitbit-merger-would-cement-googles-data-empire"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/google-fitbit-merger-would-cement-googles-data-empire&lt;/a&gt;

Neoliberalism got us into this mess, and tech was its willing accomplice. But Vipra makes a good case that tech can "increase the negotiating power of labor over capital." For Vipra, this starts with access to data: in India, "analog" workers have the legal right to know their employers' profit margins, which is key for collective bargaining. But digital workers don't have this right:

&lt;a href="https://medium.com/tech-people/new-labour-codes-explained-48a4679d4a29"&gt;https://medium.com/tech-people/new-labour-codes-explained-48a4679d4a29&lt;/a&gt;

Giving gig workers the right to their own performance data would help those workers secure competitive bids for their labor - denying workers access to this data is anti-competitive:

&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/workplace-data-rights-regulation/"&gt;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/workplace-data-rights-regulation/&lt;/a&gt;

This same data can be used to make the case for regulation and unionization: when it's your word against your boss's, it might be hard to interest public officials in protecting your working conditions. But when the data shows that gig workers are putting in 12-18 hour days without overtime, the case is harder to ignore:

&lt;a href="https://www.justjobsnetwork.org/wp-content/pubs/reports/transformations_in_technology_report.pdf"&gt;https://www.justjobsnetwork.org/wp-content/pubs/reports/transformations_in_technology_report.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

Modern employers collect vast amount of data about their workers, but share almost none of it. Again, the important thing isn't what the tech is doing, but who it's doing it &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; and who it's doing it &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;.

Vipra also singles out the one-sided nature of the platforms' use of payment technologies. Modern payment systems mean that gig work platforms collect their customers' money in near-realtime, but despite this, gig companies are the most delay-prone employers, paying workers after totally unjustifiable delays that give bosses free cash flow and force workers into precarity.

&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/former-head-of-mint-raises-4-5m-for-lean/"&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/former-head-of-mint-raises-4-5m-for-lean/&lt;/a&gt;

After this critique, Vipra proposes "a substantive agenda for labor" in five areas: algorithmic regulation, data sharing, remote work rights, financial rights, and "emancipatory automation."

Algorithmic regulation: Algorithms should have "a minimum level of explainability"; "minimum performance levels" (error rates, transparency, etc); and "human involvement in decision making" must be mandatory (so you can get prompt and effective redress when the algorithm misfires).

Data sharing: Don't just "data minimize" - "reorient it towards goals that are worker- and society-friendly." Collect and share data on labor safety, and mandate that companies "collect, analyze, and share big data to protect workers’ rights."

Remote work rights: The right to disconnect from work; the right to be paid for work equipment, including chairs, internet access, etc (I would add here, the right to have those devices configured to block employer monitoring).

Financial rights: The state should mandate financial interoperability and use account aggregators and open banking to "minimize[] the information asymmetry in favor of people for whom information is collateral." Force platforms to disclose the commissions, fees, incentives, etc they offer to workers. Provide source-code for these systems to regulators.

Emancipatory automation: "Automation should mean less drudgery and fewer working hours overall." This is what I'm getting at when I call for technologists to become full-stack Luddites:

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2022/01/cory-doctorow-science-fiction-is-a-luddite-literature/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2022/01/cory-doctorow-science-fiction-is-a-luddite-literature/&lt;/a&gt;

Overall, Vipra presents a bracing, challenging view of the way that tech can serve both labor and capital, depending on how it is configured and used. I don't agree with everything she says (the privacy section in data rights could use its own article of equal depth and critical analysis), but reading this made the hair on the back on my neck stand up (in a good way).

This is more or less what I had in mind back in 2009 when I was writing &lt;em&gt;For the Win&lt;/em&gt;, about how multiplayer games could serve as organizing platforms for an international labor vanguard (the Industrial Workers of the World Wide Web, or Webblies):

&lt;h1&gt;Monopoly's event-horizon (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/05/eldritch-physics/#wouldnt-start-from-here"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When a superdense, concentrated mass forms a black hole, the laws of physics around it change, giving rise to an eldritch zone where the normal rules don't apply. When corporations form a concentrated industry, the laws of economics likewise change.

Take copyright: when I was a baby writer, there were dozens of comparably sized New York publishers. The writers who mentored me could shop their rights around to lots of houses, which enabled them to subdivide those rights.

For example, they could separately sell paperback and hardcover rights, getting paid twice for the same book. Under those circumstances, giving authors broader copyrights and easier enforcement systems could directly translate into more groceries on those authors' tables and more gas in their cars' tanks.

But today, publishing has dwindled to five giant houses (possibly four soon, depending on whether Penguin Random House successfully appeals its blocked merger with Simon and Schuster). Under these conditions, giving exploited authors more copyright is like giving bullied schoolkids more lunch-money.

Whatever copyright authors get will be non-negotiably extracted from them via the near-identical, unviolable core contracting terms from the Big Five publisher. Today, the bullies don't just take your paperback rights, they also acquire your audio and ebook rights.

Most of them now want your &lt;em&gt;worldwide&lt;/em&gt; English rights, so you can't resell the book in the Commonwealth, and some have started demanding graphic novel, film and TV rights.

In our new book, Rebecca Giblin and I call this "chokepoint capitalism". In today's highly concentrated creative labor markets, copyright's normal role of giving creators bargaining leverage over their supply chain is transformed.

&lt;a href="https://chokepointcapitalism.com"&gt;https://chokepointcapitalism.com&lt;/a&gt;

Instead of being a tool for creators, copyright is inevitably transferred to part of the supply chain - a publisher, label, streamer, ebook retailers, etc - where it becomes a tool to beat up on the rest of the supply chain, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; creators.

But copyright isn't the only policy that breaks down at the event horizon of monopoly's black hole. &lt;em&gt;Policy itself&lt;/em&gt; breaks down, too. When power is pluralized among lots of firms an expert regulator can ask a technical question like "Does net neutrality lead to a decrease in private infrastructure investment?" and get &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of answers.

Some companies - cable operators hoping to override your choices about which data you want by slowing down traffic from sites unless they pay bribes - will insist that they can't afford to build fiber without this incentive.

Others - ISPs who want to raid the cable operators' customer base by giving you the data you request as fast as they can - will answer this charge. Both will provide supposedly empirical about their investment choices and capital and running costs, and both will vigorously probe the others' submissions for factual weaknesses.

But when all the internet in your country has been monopolized so that nearly all Americans have little or no choice of ISP, the truth-seeking exercise of regulation becomes an auction, with the monopolists bidding together to bend reality (or regulation) to their will:

&lt;a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/177-million-americans-harmed-net-neutrality"&gt;https://muninetworks.org/content/177-million-americans-harmed-net-neutrality&lt;/a&gt;

This is called "regulatory capture": when there are four or five companies running an industry, nearly everyone qualified to understand it is an executive at one of those companies. Obama's "good" FCC chair was a cable lobbyist, Trump's "bad" chair was a Verizon lawyer.

Ironically, the term "regulatory capture" originated with right-wing, anti-regulation nihilists. They argued that capture was &lt;em&gt;inevitable&lt;/em&gt; and the only way to preserve competition was to &lt;em&gt;eliminate all regulation&lt;/em&gt;, including the regulation that blocked monopoly formation.

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/regulatory-capture-59b2013e2526"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/regulatory-capture-59b2013e2526&lt;/a&gt;

Eliminating anti-monopoly rules had the entirely predictable effect of producing &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of monopolies. Today, nearly every global industry - beer, shipping, banking, athletic shoes, concert tickets, eyeglasses, etc - is dominated by a handful of firms:

&lt;a href="https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers"&gt;https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers&lt;/a&gt;

Today, the same people who advocated for removing anti-monopoly rules in every administration since Reagan's insist that their deregulation has nothing to do with the growth of monopolies - that these monopolies arise out of some mysterious force of history: &lt;em&gt;when it's monopoly time, you get monopolies.&lt;/em&gt;

This is a wild thing to say aloud among reasonably intelligent adults, like claiming, "Well, when we put out rat poison, we didn't have a rat problem. We stopped, and now we're overrun by rats. But it would be hasty to assume that removing the rat poison led to the explosion of rats (by the way, does anyone have a cure for the plague?)"

But if you haven't paid close attention to the history of antitrust law since the late 1970s, all of this might feel mysterious to you - or worse, you might mistake the cause for the effect: regulators keep making corrupt choices, so regulation itself is impossible.

This is like the artists' rights advocate who says, "artists' incomes keep falling, so we need more copyright" - in mistaking the effect for the cause, both blame the system, rather than the corporate power that has corrupted it.

The same is true in our online "censorship" "debate," which poses the issue of speech online as one of "which speech rules should the Big Tech companies that have transformed the internet into five giant websites filled with screenshots of the other four adopt?"

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/yes-its-censorship-2026c9edc0fd"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/yes-its-censorship-2026c9edc0fd&lt;/a&gt;

Good communities need good rules, sure - but by focusing on &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; rules we have, rather than what keeps people stuck in social media silos that have manifestly &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; rules, we miss the point. Absenting yourself from the major social media platforms and online messaging tools extracts major costs on your personal, professional, educational and civil life, so many of us stay within those silos, even though every day we spend there is a torment.

The focus on penalizing firms with bad rules is another one of those mistaking-the-cause-for-the-effect-and-making-it-worse phenomena. A fine-grained, high-stakes duty to moderate makes it effectively impossible for small platforms - say, community-owned co-ops - to offer an alternative to Big Tech.

And once Big Tech platforms have a duty to police their users, they can argue, reasonably enough, that they can't &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be forced to interoperate with other platforms whose users they &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; spy on and thus can't control.

The case that bad community managers give rise to toxic communities breaks down under conditions of monopoly, since attempts to improve platforms with billions of users are a) doomed (there is no three-ring binder big enough to encompass all the rules for three billion users) and b) inimical to standing up smaller, easier-to-administer communities.

Monopoly's singularity also applies to free software and open source. In the mid-1980s, Richard Stallman coined the term "free software" to apply to software that respected your freedom, specifically, the freedom to inspect, improve and redistribute it.

These were considered the necessary preconditions for freedom in a digital world. Without a guaranteed right to inspect the code that you relied on and correct the defects you found in it, you were a prisoner to the errors or ill intentions of the software's original author.

In 1998, another name was proposed for software licensed on "free" terms: "open source." Nominally, this term was intended to resolve the ambiguity between "free as in beer" and "free as in speech" - that is, to make it clear that "free software" didn't mean "noncommercial software."

This was said to be necessary to resolve the fears of commercial firms that had been frightened away from free software due to a misunderstanding. As part of this shift, advocates for "open source" shifted their emphasis from free software's ethical proposition ("software that gives you freedom") to an instrumental narrative.

Open source software was claimed to be &lt;em&gt;higher quality&lt;/em&gt; than proprietary software, because it hewed to the Enlightenment values of transparency, replicability and peer review ("with enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow").

Along with this claim, there was a second argument that open source software was &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; to develop because a "community" would gather to help maintain it. Sometimes, this was couched as a "commons" where lots of actors, large and small, would work to produce a community good.

In 2018 Benjamin "Mako" Hill delivered a keynote to the Libreplanet conference that was a kind of postmortem to the 20-year experiment in instrumentalism (open source) over ethics (free software):

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBknF2yUZZ8"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBknF2yUZZ8&lt;/a&gt;

Mako concluded that the experiment was a failure, producing a situation in which the tech giants enjoyed unlimited software freedom (because they ran the cloud servers we all depended on) while the rest of us merely had open source (the right to inspect the software powering the cloud, and to suggest ways to modify it).

In this account, the shift from ethics to instrumentalism paved the way for a series of compromises that turned the commons into a sharecropper's precarious farmstead. When the open community was asked whether cloud software should be subjected to the same copyleft terms as software distributed for users, they weighed this as an instrumental proposition ("will this make the software better"), not an ethical one ("will this give users more freedom?"), and concluded that the answer was "this is fine."

I think there's a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; to this explanation - if nothing else, it explains how such a drastic shift took place without much hue and cry. But there's another phenomenon at work that Mako's account doesn't grapple with: the rise of tech monopolies.

The reason that ethical propositions related to software freedom were sidelined so effectively in the decades after 1998 is the increasing power of tech monopolies: as tech giants gobbled up their competitors or put them out of business with predatory pricing, they gained power over regulators, universities, and individual technologists (increasingly employed by or dependent on a tech giant).

Copyleft - like copyright - breaks down at the event horizon of concentrated corporate power. With copyright, the breakdown manifests as the appropriation of copyright's "power to exclude" by the firms it was supposed to be wielded against. With copyleft, it manifests as "software freedom" being hoarded by the same firms that copyleft licenses were supposed to keep in check.

This phenomenon isn't limited to free software - it also plagues open-licensed "content" - material released under Creative Commons licenses, say. A year ago, Paul Keller and Alek Tarkowski published an important essay on "openness" entitled "The Paradox of Open":

&lt;a href="https://paradox.openfuture.eu/"&gt;https://paradox.openfuture.eu/&lt;/a&gt;

In this essay, the authors - both significant contributors to the world of free software and open content - identify a phenomenon akin to the Mako's observation of "freedom for big companies, openness for the rest of us." From Openstreetmap to CC-licensed creative works, corporate monopolies have supercharged their power by plundering the commons.

This month, Open Future, who published "Paradox," published a series of responses to the original paper:

&lt;a href="https://paradox.openfuture.eu/responses/"&gt;https://paradox.openfuture.eu/responses/&lt;/a&gt;

They are uniformly excellent, but the one that I am most interested in comes from James Boyle, "Misunderestimating Openness":

&lt;a href="https://openfuture.eu/paradox-of-open-responses/misunderestimating-openness/"&gt;https://openfuture.eu/paradox-of-open-responses/misunderestimating-openness/&lt;/a&gt;

Here, Boyle sharply disagrees with Keller and Tarkowski's argument, grouping it with similar claims about content moderation and censorship, arguing that openness was only ever a necessary - but insufficient - precondition for a better world. In the same way, online speech forums might be terrible places, but this is a failure of their moderators and their communities and their business-models, not an indictment of the idea of online discourse itself.

Both papers grapple with concentrated corporate power as a corrupting force, but neither puts it in the center of the breakdown of otherwise sound practices.

Reading all these people whom I respect and admire so much debating whether "openness" is good or bad makes me even more certain that fighting concentrated corporate power is the precondition for success in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; other goals.

Fighting concentrated corporate power may seem like a tall order, and it is, but in that fight, we have comfort in a key idea from Boyle's own work.

Boyle describes the history of the term "ecology." Before this term was in widespread use, it wasn't clear when two people were engaged in the same struggle. If you care about endangered owls and I care about the ozone layer, are we on the same team?

What do charismatic nocturnal avians have to do with the gaseous composition of the upper atmosphere?

The term "ecology" turns these issues (and a thousand more) into a &lt;em&gt;movement&lt;/em&gt;.

Today, there are people of all walks of life living in all kinds of hurt who think their pain is caused by phenomena that are downstream of corporate power. Once we figure that out - once we figure out that to make our tools work again, we need to escape the event horizon of the capitalist singularity - then we can really begin the fight in earnest.

&lt;h1&gt;Freedom of reach IS freedom of speech (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The online debate over free speech &lt;em&gt;suuuuucks&lt;/em&gt;, and, amazingly, it's &lt;em&gt;getting worse&lt;/em&gt;. This week, it's the false dichotomy between "freedom of speech" and "freedom of reach," that is, the debate over whether a platform should override your explicit choices about what you want to see:

&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3849331-musk-meets-twitter-staff-freedom-of-reach-new-ideas-on-human-verification"&gt;https://seekingalpha.com/news/3849331-musk-meets-twitter-staff-freedom-of-reach-new-ideas-on-human-verification&lt;/a&gt;

It's wild that we're still having this fight. It is literally the first internet fight! The modern internet was born out of an epic struggled between "Bellheads" (who believed centralized powers should decide how you used networks) and "Netheads" (who believed that services should be provided and consumed "at the edge"):

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/1996/10/atm-3/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/1996/10/atm-3/&lt;/a&gt;

The Bellheads grew out of the legacy telco system, which was committed to two principles: universal service and monetization. The large telcos were obliged to provide service to everyone (for some value of "everyone"), and in exchange, they enjoyed a monopoly over the phone system and the people who relied on it.

That meant that they could decide which services and features you had, and could ask the government to intervene to block competitors who added services and features they didn't like. They wielded this power without restraint or mercy, targeting, for example, the Hush-A-Phone, a cup you stuck to your phone receiver to muffle your speech and prevent eavesdropping:

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush-A-Phone"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush-A-Phone&lt;/a&gt;

They didn't block new features for shits and giggles, though - the method to this madness was rent-extraction. The iron-clad rule of the Bell System was that anything that improved on the basic service had to have a price-tag attached. Every phone "feature" was a recurring source of monthly revenue for the phone company - even the phone itself, which you couldn't buy, and had to rent, month after month, year after year, until you'd paid for it hundreds of times over.

This is an early and important example of "predatory inclusion": the monopoly carriers delivered universal service to all of us, but that was a prelude to an ugly, parasitic, rent-seeking way of doing business:

&lt;a href="https://lpeproject.org/blog/predatory-inclusion-a-long-view-of-the-race-for-profit/"&gt;https://lpeproject.org/blog/predatory-inclusion-a-long-view-of-the-race-for-profit/&lt;/a&gt;

It wasn't just the phone that came with an unlimited price-tag: everything you did with the phone was also a la carte, like the bananas-high long-distance charges, or even per-minute charges for &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; calls. Features like call waiting were monetized through recurring monthly charges, too.

Remember when Caller ID came in and you had to pay $2.50/month to find out who was calling you before you answered the phone? That's a pure Bellhead play. If we applied this principle to the internet, then you'd have to pay $2.50/month to see the "from" line on an email before you opened it.

Bellheads believed in "smart" networks. Netheads believed in what David Isenberg called "The Stupid Network," a "dumb pipe" whose only job was to let some people send signals to other people, who asked to get them:

&lt;a href="https://www.isen.com/papers/Dawnstupid.html"&gt;https://www.isen.com/papers/Dawnstupid.html&lt;/a&gt;

This is called the End-to-End (E2E) principle: a network is E2E if it lets anyone receive any message from anyone else, without a third party intervening. It's a straightforward idea, though the spam wars brought in an important modification: the message should be &lt;em&gt;consensual&lt;/em&gt; (DoS attacks, spam, etc don't count).

The degradation of the internet into "five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of text from the other four" (h/t Tom Eastman) meant the end of end-to-end. If you're a Youtuber, Tiktoker, tweeter, or Facebooker, the fact that someone &lt;em&gt;explicitly subscribed to your feed&lt;/em&gt; does not mean that they will, in fact, see your feed.

The platforms treat your unambiguous request to receive messages from others as mere suggestions, a "signal" to be mixed into other signals in the content moderation algorithm that orders your feed, mixing in items from strangers whose material you never asked to see.

There's nothing wrong in principle with the idea of a system that recommends items from strangers. Indeed, that's a great way to find people to follow! But "stuff we think you'll like" is not the same category as "stuff you've asked to see."

Why do companies balk at showing you what you've asked to be shown? Sometimes it's because they're trying to be helpful. Maybe their research, or the inferences from their user surveillance, suggests that you actually prefer it that way.

But there's another side to this: a feed composed of things from people is &lt;em&gt;fungible&lt;/em&gt;. Theoretically, you could uproot that feed from one platform and settle it in another one - if everyone you follow on Twitter set up an account on Mastodon, you could use a tool like Movetodon to refollow them there and get the same feed:

&lt;a href="https://www.movetodon.org/"&gt;https://www.movetodon.org/&lt;/a&gt;

A feed that is controlled by a company using secret algorithms is much harder for a rival to replicate. That's why Spotify is so hellbent on getting you to listen to playlists, rather than albums. Your favorite albums are the same no matter where you are, but playlists are integrated into services.

But there's another side to this playlistification of feeds: playlists and other recommendation algorithms are chokepoints: they are a way to durably interpose a company between a creator and their audience. Where you have chokepoints, you get chokepoint capitalism:

&lt;a href="https://chokepointcapitalism.com/"&gt;https://chokepointcapitalism.com/&lt;/a&gt;

That's when a company captures an audience inside a walled garden and then extracts value from creators as a condition of reaching them, even when the audience &lt;em&gt;requests&lt;/em&gt; the creator's work. With Spotify, that manifests as payola, where creators have to pay for inclusion on playlists. Spotify uses playlists to manipulate audiences into listening to sound-alikes, silently replacing the ambient artists that listeners tune in to hear with work-for-hire musicians who aren't entitled to royalties.

Facebook's payola works much the same: when you publish a post on Facebook, you have to pay to boost it if you want it to reach the people who follow you - that is, the people who signed up to see what you post. Facebook may claim that it does this to keep its users' feeds "uncluttered" but that's a very thin pretense. Though you follow friends and family on Facebook, your feed is weighted to accounts willing to cough up the payola to reach you.

The "uncluttering" excuse wears even thinner when you realize that there's no way to tell a platform: "This isn't clutter, show it to me &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; time." Think of how the cartel of giant email providers uses the excuse of spam to block mailing lists and newsletters that their users have &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; signed up for. Those users can fish those messages out of their spam folders, they can add the senders to their address books, they can write an email rule that says, "If sender is X, then mark message as 'not spam'" and the messages &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; go to spam:

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d&lt;/a&gt;

One sign of just how irredeemably stupid the online free expression debate is that we're arguing over stupid shit like whether &lt;em&gt;unsolicited&lt;/em&gt; fundraising emails from politicians should be marked as spam, rather than whether &lt;em&gt;solicited&lt;/em&gt;, double-opt-in newsletters and mailing lists should be:

&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-committee-sues-google-over-email-spam-filters/"&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-committee-sues-google-over-email-spam-filters/&lt;/a&gt;

When it comes to email, the stuff we &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; argue about is so much more important than the stuff we do. Think of how email list providers blithely advertise that they can tell you the "open rate" of the messages that you send - which means that they embed surveillance beacons (tracking pixels) in every message they send:

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-email-open-tracking-quietly-took-over-the-web/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/how-email-open-tracking-quietly-took-over-the-web/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Sending&lt;/em&gt; emails that spy on users is gross, but the &lt;em&gt;fucking disgusting&lt;/em&gt; part is that our email clients &lt;em&gt;don't block spying by default&lt;/em&gt;. Blocking tracking pixels is easy as hell, and almost no one &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to be spied on when they read their email! The onboarding process for webmail accounts should have a dialog box that reads, "Would you like me to tell creepy randos which emails you read?" with the default being "Fuck no!" and the alternative being "Hurt me, Daddy!"

If email providers wanted to "declutter" your inbox, they could offer you a dashboard of senders whose messsages you delete unread most of the time and offer to send those messages straight to spam in future. Instead they nonconsensually intervene to block messages and offer no way to override those blocks.

When it comes to recommendations, companies have an unresolvable conflict of interest: &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; they're interfering with your communications to make your life better, or &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; they're doing it to make money for their shareholders. Sorting one from the other is nigh impossible, because it turns on the company's intent, and it's impossible to read product managers' minds.

This is intrinsic to platform capitalism. When platforms are getting started, their imperative is to increase their user-base. To do that, they shift surpluses to their users - think of how Amazon started off by subsidizing products and deliveries.

That lured in businesses, and shifted some of that surplus to sellers - giving fat compensation to Kindle authors and incredible reach to hard goods sellers in Marketplace. More sellers brought in more customers, who brought in more sellers.

Once sellers couldn't afford to leave Amazon because of customers, and customers couldn't afford to leave Amazon because of sellers, the company shifted the surplus to &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;. It imposed impossible fees on sellers - Amazon's $31b/year "advertising" business is just payola - and when sellers raised prices to cover those fees, Amazon used "Most Favored Nation" contracts to force sellers to raise prices everywhere else.

The enshittification of Amazon - where you search for a specific product and get six screens of ads for different, worse ones - is the natural end-state of chokepoint capitalism:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/28/enshittification/#relentless-payola"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/28/enshittification/#relentless-payola&lt;/a&gt;

That same enshittification is on every platform, and "freedom of speech is not freedom of reach" is just a way of saying, "Now that you're stuck here, we're going to enshittify your experience."

Because while it's hard to tell if &lt;em&gt;recommendations&lt;/em&gt; are fair or not, it's very easy to tell whether blocking end-to-end is unfair. When a person asks for another person to send them messages, and a third party intervenes to block those messages, that is censorship. Even if you call it "freedom of reach," it's still censorship.

For creators, interfering with E2E is also wage-theft. If you're making stuff for Youtube or Tiktok or another platform and that platform's algorithm decides you've broken a rule and therefore your subscribers won't see your video, that means you don't get paid.

It's as if your boss handed you a paycheck with only half your pay in it, and when you asked what happened to the other half, your boss said, "You broke some rules so I docked your pay, but I won't tell you which rules because if I did, you might figure out how to break them without my noticing."

Content moderation is the only part of information security where security-through-obscurity is considered good practice:

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/como-is-infosec-307f87004563"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/como-is-infosec-307f87004563&lt;/a&gt;

That's why content moderation algorithms are a labor issue, and why projects like Tracking Exposed, which reverse-engineer those algorithms to give creative workers and their audiences control over what they see, are fighting for labor rights:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/tracking-exposed-demanding-gods-explain-themselves"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/tracking-exposed-demanding-gods-explain-themselves&lt;/a&gt;

We're at the tail end of a ghastly, 15-year experiment in neo-Bellheadism, with the big platforms treating end-to-end as a relic of a simpler time, rather than as "an elegant weapon from a more civilized age."

The post-Twitter platforms like Mastodon and Tumblr are E2E platforms, designed around the idea that if someone asks to hear what you have to say, they should hear it. Rather than developing algorithms to override your decisions, these platforms have extensive tooling to let you fine-tune what you see.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/08/locus-of-individuation/#publish-then-filter"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/08/locus-of-individuation/#publish-then-filter&lt;/a&gt;

This tooling was once the subject of intense development and innovation, but all that research fell by the wayside with the rise of platforms, who are actively hostile to third party mods that gave users more control over their feeds:

&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/27/og-app-promises-you-an-ad-free-instagram-feed/"&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/27/og-app-promises-you-an-ad-free-instagram-feed/&lt;/a&gt;

Alas, lawmakers are way behind the curve on this, demanding new "online safety" rules that &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; firms to break E2E &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; block third-party de-enshittification tools:

&lt;a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/online-safety-made-dangerous/"&gt;https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/online-safety-made-dangerous/&lt;/a&gt;

The online free speech debate is stupid because it has all the wrong focuses:

&lt;li&gt;Focusing on improving algorithms, not whether you can even &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; a feed of things you asked to see;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on whether unsolicited messages are delivered, not whether &lt;em&gt;solicited&lt;/em&gt; messages reach their readers;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on algorithmic transparency, not whether you can opt out of the behavioral tracking that produces training data for algorithms;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on whether platforms are policing their users well enough, not whether we can leave a platform without losing our important social, professional and personal ties;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on whether the limits on our speech violate the First Amendment, rather than whether they are unfair:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The wholly artificial distinction between "freedom of speech" and "freedom of reach" is just more self-serving nonsense and the only reason we're talking about it is that a billionaire dilettante would like to create chokepoints so he can extract payola from his users and meet his debt obligations to the Saudi royal family.

Billionaire dilettantes have their own stupid definitions of all kinds of important words like "freedom" and "discrimination" and "free speech." Remember: these definitions have &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; to do with how the world's 7,999,997,332 non-billionaires experience these concepts.

&lt;h1&gt;Social Quitting (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/09/watch-the-surpluses/#exogenous-shocks"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In "Social Quitting," my latest &lt;em&gt;Locus Magazine&lt;/em&gt; column, I advance a theory to explain the precipitous vibe shift in how many of us view the once-dominant social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter, and how it is that we have so quickly gone from asking what we can do to get these services out of our lives to where we should go now that we're all ready to leave them:

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/01/commentary-cory-doctorow-social-quitting/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2023/01/commentary-cory-doctorow-social-quitting/&lt;/a&gt;

The core of the argument revolves around surpluses - that is, the value that exists in the service. For a user, surpluses are things like "being able to converse with your friends" and "being able to plan activities with your friends." For advertisers, surpluses are things like "being able to target ads based on the extraction and processing of private user data" and "being able to force users to look at ads before they can talk to one another."

For the platforms, surpluses are things like, "Being able to force advertisers and business customers to monetize their offerings through the platform, blocking rivals like Onlyfans, Patreon, Netflix, Amazon, etc" and things like "Being able to charge more for ads" and "being able to clone your business customers' products and then switch your users to the in-house version."

Platforms control most of the surplus-allocating options. They can tune your feed so that it mostly consists of media and text from people you explicitly chose to follow, or so that it consists of ads, sponsored posts, or posts they think will "boost engagement" by sinking you into a dismal clickhole. They can made ads skippable or unskippable. They can block posts with links to rival sites to force their business customers to transact within their platform, so they can skim fat commissions every time money changes hands and so that they can glean market intelligence about which of their business customers' products they should clone and displace.

But platforms can't just allocate surpluses will-ye or nill-ye. No one would join a brand-new platform whose sales-pitch was, "No matter who you follow, we'll show you other stuff; there will be lots of ads that you can't skip; we will spy on you a lot." Likewise, no one would sign up to advertise or sell services on a platform whose pitch was "Our ads are really expensive. Any business you transact has to go through us, and we'll take all your profits in junk fees. This also lets us clone you and put you out of business."

Instead, platforms have to carefully shift their surpluses around: first they have to lure in users, who will attract business customers, who will generate the fat cash surpluses that can be creamed off for the platforms' investors. All of this has to be orchestrated to lock in each group, so that they won't go elsewhere when the service is enshittified as it processes through its life-cycle.

This is where network effects and switching costs come into play. A service has "network effects" if it gets more valuable as users join it. You joined Twitter to talk to the people who were already using it, and then other people joined so they could talk to you.

"Switching costs" are what you have to give up when you leave a service: if a service is siloed - if it blocks interoperability with rivals - then quitting that service means giving up access to the people whom you left behind. This is the single most important difference between ActivityPub-based Fediverse services like Mastodon and the silos like Twitter and Facebook - you can quit a Fediverse server and set up somewhere else, and still maintain your follows and followers:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/#free-as-in-puppies"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/#free-as-in-puppies&lt;/a&gt;

In the absence of interoperability, network effects impose their own switching cost: the "collective action problem" of deciding when to leave and where to go. If you depend on the people you follow and who follow you - for emotional support, for your livelihood, for community - then the extreme difficulty of convincing everyone to leave at the same time and go somewhere else means that you can be enticed into staying on a service that you no longer enjoy. The platforms can shift the surpluses away from you, provided that doing so makes you less miserable than abandoning your friends or fans or customers would. This is the &lt;em&gt;Fiddler On the Roof&lt;/em&gt; problem: everyone stays put in the shtetl even though the cossacks ride through on the reg and beat the shit out of them, because they can't all agree on where to go if they leave:

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/how-to-leave-dying-social-media-platforms-9fc550fe5abf"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/how-to-leave-dying-social-media-platforms-9fc550fe5abf&lt;/a&gt;

So the first stage of the platform lifecycle is luring in users by allocating lots of surplus to them - making the service fun and great and satisfying to use. Few or no ads, little or no overt data-collection, feeds that emphasize the people you want to hear from, not the people willing to pay to reach you.

This continues until the service attains a critical mass: once it becomes impossible to, say, enroll your kid in a little-league baseball team without having a Facebook account, then Facebook can start shifting its surpluses to advertisers and other business-users of the platform, who will pay Facebook to interpose themselves in your use of the platform. You'll hate it, but you won't leave. Junior loves little-league.

Facebook can enshittify its user experience because the users are now locked in, holding each other hostage. If Facebook can use the courts and technological countermeasures to block interoperable services, it can increase its users' switching costs, producing more opportunities for lucrative enshittification without the risk of losing the users that make Facebook valuable to advertisers. That's why Facebook pioneered so many legal tactics for criminalizing interoperability:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/facebook-v-power-ventures"&gt;https://www.eff.org/cases/facebook-v-power-ventures&lt;/a&gt;

This is the second phase of the toxic platform life-cycle: luring in business customers by shifting surpluses from users to advertisers, sellers, etc. This is the moment when the platforms offer cheap and easy monetization, low transaction fees, few barriers to off-platform monetization, etc. This is when, for example, a news organization can tease an article on its website with an off-platform link, luring users to click through and see the ads it controls.

Because Facebook has locked in its users through mutual hostage-taking, it can pollute their feeds with &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of these posts to news organizations' sites, bumping down the messages from its users' friends, and that means that Facebook can selectively tune how much traffic it gives to different kinds of business customers. If Facebook wants to lure in sports sites, it can cram those sites' posts into millions of users' feeds and send floods of traffic to sports outlets.

Outlets that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; participate in Facebook lose out, and so they join Facebook, start shoveling their content into it, hiring SEO Kremlinologists to help them figure out how to please The Algorithm, in hopes of gaining a permanent, durable source of readers (and thus revenue) for their site.

But ironically, once a critical mass of sports sites are on Facebook, Facebook no longer needs to prioritize sports sites in its users' feeds. Now that the sports sites all believe that a Facebook presence is a competitive necessity, they will hold each other hostage there, egging each other on to put &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; things on Facebook, even as the traffic dwindles.

Once sports sites have taken each other hostage, Facebook can claw back the surplus it allocated to them and use it to rope in another sector - health sites, casual games, employment seekers, financial advisors, etc etc. Each group is ensnared by a similar dynamic to the one that locks in the users.

But there is a difference between users' surpluses and business's surpluses. A user's surplus is &lt;em&gt;attention&lt;/em&gt;, and there is no such thing as an "attention economy." You can't use attention to pay for data-centers, or executive bonuses, or to lobby Congress. Attention is not a currency in the same way that cryptos are not currency - it is not a store of value, nor a unit of exchange, nor a unit of account.

Turning attention into money requires the same tactics as turning crypto into money - you have to lure in people who have real, actual money and convince them to swap it for attention. With crypto, this involved paying Larry David, Matt Damon, Spike Lee and LeBron James to lie about crypto's future in order to rope in suckers who would swap their perfectly cromulent "fiat" money for unspendable crypto tokens.

With platforms, you need to bring in business customers who get paid in actual cash and convince them to give you that cash in exchange for ethereal, fast-evaporating, inconstant, unmeasurable "attention." This works like any Ponzi scheme (that is, it works like cryptos): you can use your shareholders' cash to pay short-term returns to business customers, losing a little money as a convincer that brings in more trade.

That's what Facebook did when it sent enormous amounts of traffic to a select few news-sites that fell for the "pivot to video" fraud, in order to convince their competitors to borrow billions of dollars to finance Facebook's bid to compete with Youtube:

&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/metaverse-means-pivot-to-video-adbe09319038"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/metaverse-means-pivot-to-video-adbe09319038&lt;/a&gt;

This convincer strategy is found in every con. If you go to the county fair, you'll see some poor bastard walking around all day with a giant teddy bear that he "won" by throwing three balls into a peach-basket. The carny who operated that midway game let him win the teddy precisely so that he would walk around all day, advertising the game, which is rigged so that no one else wins the giant teddy-bear:

&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2006/08/27/rigged-carny-game.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2006/08/27/rigged-carny-game.html&lt;/a&gt;

Social media platforms can allocate giant teddy-bears to business-customers, and it can also withdraw them at will. Careful allocations mean that the platform can rope in a critical mass of business customers and then begin the final phase of its life-cycle: allocating surpluses to its shareholders.

We know what this looks like.

That is, once a platform has its users locked in, and has its business customers locked in, it can enshittify its service to the point of near uselessness without losing either, allocating &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the useful surplus in the business to its shareholders.

But this strategy has a problem: users and business customers don't like to be locked in! They will constantly try to find ways to de-enshittify your service and/or leave for greener pastures. And being at war with your users and business customers means that your reputation continuously declines, because every time a user or business customer figures out a way to claw back some surplus, you have to visibly, obviously enshittify your service wrestle it back.

Every time a service makes headlines for blocking an ad-blocker, or increasing its transaction fees, or screwing over its users or business customers in some other way, it makes the case that the price you pay for using the service is not worth the value it delivers.

In other words, the platforms try to establish an equilibrium where they only leave business customers and users with the absolute bare minimum needed to keep them on the service, and extract the rest for their shareholders. But this is a very brittle equilibrium, because the prices that platforms impose on their users and business customers can change very quickly, even if the platforms don't do anything differently.

Users and business customers can revalue the privacy costs, or the risks of staying on the platform based on exogenous factors. Privacy scandals and other ruptures can make the cost you've been paying for years seem higher than you realized and no longer worth it.

This problem isn't unique to social media platforms, either. It's endemic to end-stage capitalism, where companies can go on for years paying their workers just barely enough to survive (or even less, expecting them to get public assistance and/or a side-hustle), and those workers can tolerate it, and tolerate it, and tolerate it - until one day, they stop.

The Great Resignation, Quiet Quitting, the mass desertions from the gig economy - they all prove Stein's Law: "Anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop."

Same for long, brittle supply-chains, where all the surplus has been squeezed out: concentrating all the microchip production in China and Taiwan, all the medical saline in Puerto Rico, all the shipping into three cartels... This strategy works well, and can be perfectly tuned with mathematical models that cut right to the joint, and they work and they work.

Until they stop. Until covid. Or war. Or wildfires. Or floods. Or interest rate hikes. Or revolution. All this stuff works great until you wake up and discover that the delicate balance between paying for guard labor and paying for a fair society has tilted, and now there's a mob building a guillotine outside the gates of your luxury compound.

This is the force underpinning collapse: "gradually, then suddenly" A steady erosion of the failsafes, flensing all the slack out of the system, extracting all the surpluses until there's nothing left in the reservoir, no reason to stay.

It's what caused the near-collapse of Barnes and Noble, and while there are plenty of ways to describe James Daunt's successful turnaround, the most general characterization is, "He has reallocated the company's surpluses to workers, readers, writers and publishers":

&lt;a href="https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/what-can-we-learn-from-barnes-and"&gt;https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/what-can-we-learn-from-barnes-and&lt;/a&gt;

A system can never truly stabilize. This is why utopias are nonsense: even if you design the most perfect society in which everything works brilliantly, it will still have to cope with war and meteors and pandemics and other factors beyond your control. A system can't just work well, it has to fail well.

This is why I object so strenuously to people who characterize my 2017 novel &lt;em&gt;Walkaway&lt;/em&gt; as a "dystopian novel." Yes, the protagonists are eking out survival amidst a climate emergency and a failing state, but they aren't giving up, they're building something new:

&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2017/06/bruce-sterling-reviews-cory-doctorow/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2017/06/bruce-sterling-reviews-cory-doctorow/&lt;/a&gt;

"Dystopia" isn't when things go wrong. Assuming nothing will go wrong doesn't make you an optimist, it makes you an asshole. A &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt; asshole. Assuming nothing will go wrong is why they didn't put enough lifeboats on the &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;. Dystopia isn't where things go wrong. Dystopia is when things go wrong, and &lt;em&gt;nothing can be done about it&lt;/em&gt;.

Anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop. The social media barons who reeled users and business customers into a mutual hostage-taking were confident that their self-licking ice-cream cone - in which we all continued to energetically produce surpluses for them to harvest, because we couldn't afford to leave - would last forever.

They were wrong. The important thing about the Fediverse isn't that it's noncommercial or decentralized - it's that its design impedes surplus harvesting. The Fediverse is designed to keep switching costs as low as possible, by enshrining the "right of exit" into the technical architecture of the system. The ability to leave a service without paying a price is the best defense we have against the scourge of enshittification.

&lt;h1&gt;Why the Fed wants to crush workers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/19/creditors-vs-workers/#finance-colored-glasses"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The US Federal Reserve has two imperatives: keeping employment high and inflation low. But when these come into conflict - when unemployment falls to near-zero - the Fed forgets all about full employment and cranks up interest rates to "cool the economy" (that is, "to destroy jobs and increase unemployment").

An economy "cools down" when workers have less money, which means that the prices offered for goods and services go down, as fewer workers have less money to spend. As with every macroeconomic policy, raising interest rates has "distributional effects," which is economist-speak for "winners and losers."

Predicting who wins and who loses when interest rates go up requires that we understand the economic relations between different kinds of rich people, as well as relations between rich people and working people. Writing today for &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;'s superb Great Inflation Myths series, Gerald Epstein and Aaron Medlin break it down:

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-01-19-inflation-federal-reserve-protects-one-percent/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/2023-01-19-inflation-federal-reserve-protects-one-percent/&lt;/a&gt;

Recall that the Fed has two priorities: full employment and low interest rates. But when it weighs these priorities, it does so through "finance colored" glasses: as an institution, the Fed requires help from banks to carry out its policies, while Fed employees rely on those banks for cushy, high-paid jobs when they rotate out of public service.

Inflation is bad for banks, whose fortunes rise and fall based on the value of the interest payments they collect from debtors. When the value of the dollar declines, lenders lose and borrowers win. Think of it this way: say you borrow $10,000 to buy a car, at a moment when $10k is two months' wages for the average US worker. Then inflation hits: prices go up, workers demand higher pay to keep pace, and a couple years later, $10k is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; month's wages.

If your wages kept pace with inflation, you're now getting twice as many dollars as you were when you took out the loan. Don't get too excited: these dollars buy the same quantity of goods as your pre-inflation salary. However, the share of your income that's eaten by that monthly car-loan payment has been cut in half. You just got a real-terms 50% discount on your car loan!

Inflation is great news for borrowers, bad news for lenders, and any given financial institution is more likely to be a lender than a borrower. The finance sector is the &lt;em&gt;creditor&lt;/em&gt; sector, and the Fed is institutionally and personally loyal to the finance sector. When creditors and debtors have opposing interests, the Fed helps creditors win.

The US is a debtor nation. Not the national debt - federal debt and deficits are just scorekeeping. The US government spends money into existence and taxes it out of existence, every single day. If the USG has a deficit, that means it spent more than than it taxed, which is another way of saying that it left more dollars in the economy this year than it took out of it. If the US runs a "balanced budget," then every dollar that was created this year was matched by another dollar that was annihilated. If the US runs a "surplus," then there are fewer dollars left for us to use than there were at the start of the year.

The US debt that matters isn't the federal debt, it's the private sector's debt. Your debt and mine. We are a debtor nation. Half of Americans have less than $400 in the bank.

&lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/personal-finance/articles/49-of-americans-couldnt-cover-a-400-emergency-expense-today-up-from-32-in-november/"&gt;https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/personal-finance/articles/49-of-americans-couldnt-cover-a-400-emergency-expense-today-up-from-32-in-november/&lt;/a&gt;

Most Americans have little to no retirement savings. Decades of wage stagnation have left Americans with less buying power, and the economy has been running on consumer debt for a generation. Meanwhile, working Americans have been burdened with forms of inflation the Fed doesn't give a shit about, like skyrocketing costs for housing and higher education.

When politicians jawbone about "inflation," they're talking about the inflation that matters to creditors. Debtors - the bottom 90% - have been burdened with three decades' worth of steadily mounting inflation that no one talks about. Yesterday, the &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt; ran Nancy Folbre's outstanding piece on "care inflation" - the skyrocketing costs of day-care, nursing homes, eldercare, etc:

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-01-18-inflation-unfair-costs-of-care/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/2023-01-18-inflation-unfair-costs-of-care/&lt;/a&gt;

As Folbre wrote, these costs are doubly burdensome, because they fall on family members (almost entirely women), who have to sacrifice their own earning potential to care for children, or aging people, or disabled family members. The cost of care has increased every year since &lt;em&gt;1997&lt;/em&gt;:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/18/wages-for-housework/#low-wage-workers-vs-poor-consumers"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/18/wages-for-housework/#low-wage-workers-vs-poor-consumers&lt;/a&gt;

So while politicians and economists talk about rescuing "savers" from having their nest-eggs whittled away by inflation, these savers represent a minuscule and dwindling proportion of the public. The real beneficiaries of interest rate hikes aren't savers, but &lt;em&gt;lenders&lt;/em&gt;.

Full employment is bad for the wealthy. When everyone has a job, wages go up, because bosses can't threaten workers with "exile to the reserve army of the unemployed." If workers are afraid of ending up jobless and homeless, then executives seeking to increase their own firms' profits can shift money from workers to shareholders without their workers quitting (and if the workers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; quit, there are plenty more desperate for their jobs).

What's more, those same executives own huge portfolios of "financialized" assets - that is, they own claims on the interest payments that borrowers in the economy pay to creditors.

The purpose of raising interest rates is to "cool the economy," a euphemism for increasing unemployment and reducing wages. Fighting inflation helps creditors and hurts debtors. The same people who benefit from increased unemployment &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; benefit from low inflation.

Thus: "the current Fed policy of rapidly raising interest rates to fight inflation by throwing people out of work serves as a wealth protection device for the top one percent."

Now, it's also true that high interest rates tend to tank the stock market, and rich people &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; own a lot of stock. This is where it's important to draw distinctions within the capital class: the merely rich do things for a living (and thus care about companies' productive capacity), while the super-rich &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; things for a living, and care about debt service.

Epstein and Medlin are economists at UMass Amherst, and they built a model that looks at the distributional outcomes (that is, the winners and losers) from interest rate hikes, using data from 40 years' worth of Fed rate hikes:

&lt;a href="https://peri.umass.edu/images/Medlin_Epstein_PERI_inflation_conf_WP.pdf"&gt;https://peri.umass.edu/images/Medlin_Epstein_PERI_inflation_conf_WP.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

They concluded that "The net impact of the Fed’s restrictive monetary policy on the wealth of the top one percent depends on the timing and balance of [lower inflation and higher interest]. It turns out that in recent decades the outcome has, on balance, worked out quite well for the wealthy."

How well? "Without intervention by the Fed, a 6 percent acceleration of inflation would erode their wealth by around 30 percent in real terms after three years...when the Fed intervenes with an aggressive tightening, the 1%'s wealth only declines about 16 percent after three years. That is a 14 percent &lt;em&gt;net gain&lt;/em&gt; in real terms."

This is why you see a split between the one-percenters and the ten-percenters in whether the Fed should continue to jack interest rates up. For the 1%, inflation hikes produce massive, long term gains. For the 10%, those gains are smaller and take longer to materialize.

Meanwhile, when there is mass unemployment, both groups benefit from lower wages and are happy to keep interest rates at zero, a rate that (in the absence of a wealth tax) creates massive asset bubbles that drive up the value of houses, stocks and other things that rich people own lots more of than everyone else.

This explains a lot about the current enthusiasm for high interest rates, despite high interest rates' ability to &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; inflation, as Joseph Stiglitz and Ira Regmi wrote in their recent Roosevelt Institute paper:

&lt;a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RI_CausesofandResponsestoTodaysInflation_Report_202212.pdf"&gt;https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RI_CausesofandResponsestoTodaysInflation_Report_202212.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

The two esteemed economists compared interest rate hikes to medieval bloodletting, where "doctors" did "more of the same when their therapy failed until the patient either had a miraculous recovery (for which the bloodletters took credit) or died (which was more likely)."

As they document, workers today aren't recreating the dread "wage-price spiral" of the 1970s: despite low levels of unemployment, workers wages still aren't keeping up with inflation. Inflation itself is falling, for the fairly obvious reason that covid supply-chain shocks are dwindling and substitutes for Russian gas are coming online.

Economic activity is "largely below trend," and with healthy levels of sales in "non-traded goods" (imports), meaning that the stuff that American workers are consuming isn't coming out of America's pool of resources or manufactured goods, and that spending is leaving the US economy, rather than contributing to an American firm's buying power.

Despite this, the Fed has a substantial cheering section for continued interest rates, composed of the ultra-rich and their lickspittle Renfields. While the specifics are quite modern, the underlying dynamic is as old as civilization itself.

Historian Michael Hudson specializes in the role that debt and credit played in different societies. As he's written, ancient civilizations long ago discovered that without periodic debt cancellation, an ever larger share of a societies' productive capacity gets diverted to the whims of a small elite of lenders, until civilization itself collapses:

&lt;a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/07/michael-hudson-from-junk-economics-to-a-false-view-of-history-where-western-civilization-took-a-wrong-turn.html"&gt;https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/07/michael-hudson-from-junk-economics-to-a-false-view-of-history-where-western-civilization-took-a-wrong-turn.html&lt;/a&gt;

Here's how that dynamic goes: to produce things, you need inputs. Farmers need seed, fertilizer, and farm-hands to produce crops. Crucially, you need to acquire these inputs &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the crops come in - which means you need to be able to buy inputs before you sell the crops. You have to borrow.

In good years, this works out fine. You borrow money, buy your inputs, produce and sell your goods, and repay the debt. But even the best-prepared producer can get a bad beat: floods, droughts, blights, pandemics...Play the game long enough and eventually you'll find yourself unable to repay the debt.

In the next round, you go into things owing more money than you can cover, even if you have a bumper crop. You sell your crop, pay as much of the debt as you can, and go into the next season having to borrow more on top of the overhang from the last crisis. This continues over time, until you get another crisis, which you have no reserves to cover because they've all been eaten up paying off the last crisis. You go further into debt.

Over the long run, this dynamic produces a society of creditors whose wealth increases every year, who can make coercive claims on the productive labor of everyone else, who not only owes them money, but will owe even more as a result of doing the work that is demanded of them.

Successful ancient civilizations fought this with Jubilee: periodic festivals of debt-forgiveness, which were announced when new monarchs assumed their thrones, or after successful wars, or just whenever the creditor class was getting too powerful and threatened the crown.

Of course, creditors hated this and fought it bitterly, just as our modern one-percenters do. When rulers managed to hold them at bay, their nations prospered. But when creditors captured the state and abolished Jubilee, as happened in ancient Rome, the state collapsed:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/08/jubilant/#construire-des-passerelles"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/08/jubilant/#construire-des-passerelles&lt;/a&gt;

Are we speedrunning the collapse of Rome? It's not for me to say, but I strongly recommend reading Margaret Coker's in-depth &lt;em&gt;Propublica&lt;/em&gt; investigation on how title lenders (loansharks that hit desperate, low-income borrowers with triple-digit interest loans) fired any employee who explained to a borrower that they needed to make more than the minimum payment, or they'd never pay off their debts:

&lt;h1&gt;Podcasts are hearteningly enshittification resistant (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/27/enshittification-resistance/#ummauerter-garten-nein"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

In the enshittification cycle, a platform lures in users by giving them a good deal at first, then it lures in business customers (advertisers, sellers, performers) by shifting the surplus from users to them; finally, it takes all the surplus for itself, turning the whole thing into a pile of shit:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys&lt;/a&gt;

When a company is neither disciplined by competition nor by regulation, enshittification inevitably ensues. If a user or business customer can't jump ship - because of lock-in, high switching costs or network effects - then companies are powerfully tempted to mistreat them - not out of sadism, but instead to harvest their surplus and goose the company's profits.

Half the results on the first five screens of an Amazon search result are ads. Amazon's business customers spend $31b/year on payola, bidding to be at the top of Amazon's search results: the top results aren't the best matches to your search, they're the matches that are most profitable for Amazon.

But out of the remaining half, many of the results are Amazon's lookalike products: Amazon coerces sellers into shipping via Amazon warehouses (otherwise their products won't be Prime eligible), and this not only lets Amazon extract 45%+ out of every sale in junk fees, it also lets them see the bills-of-lading that identify the manufacturers of products, whom Amazon can approach to make a knock-off.

These Amazon house-brand copycat products are cheaper than the original, because Amazon doesn't charge itself &amp;gt;45% fees. It can allocate some of the surplus to shoppers - offering a discount on the price the OEM has had to inflate to cover Amazon's fees - but keep the majority for its shareholders.

This is enshittification: Amazon is a place where buyers hold the sellers hostage (because Amazon is where all the buyers are, and the buyers are prepaying for shipping a year at a time via Prime), but the buyers can't leave either, because all the sellers are at Amazon. The sellers don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be on Amazon, but all the buyers are there, so...

Hypothetically there's another way to discipline Amazon's appetites as it gorges itself on all of us, buyer or seller: regulation. Much of Amazon's conduct falls under the broad terms "unfair and deceptive," which the FTC has broad authority to prohibit and punish under Section 5 of the FTC Act.

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge&lt;/a&gt;

The FTC is undergoing a renaissance under Lina Khan, its most effective chair in forty years, and she is aggressively wielding her Section 5 powers to hold corporations to account, but the FTC has two generations' worth of policy debt to pay down, and enshittification is everywhere, so Amazon and other firms generally behave as though there was no threat of regulatory punishment for even the most egregious conduct. They don't have to outrun Lina Khan, they just have to outrun all the other firms she has in her crosshairs.

Corporations, unfettered by competition or regulation, are free to pursue enshittification to the bitter end: once they have their users locked in, they use them as bait to lure in business customers, and once &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are locked in, they can grab all the value for themselves, surfing the line between "so useless everyone quits" and "just useful enough that everyone keeps holding each other hostage."

Enshittification is a dangerous strategy, and not just because that's a hard wave to surf. Woe betide a platform that enshittifies prematurely, before its users or business customers are too locked in to simply say, "fuck this, I'm out of here." That's an expensive mistake, one that can cost a company all the consumer and supplier subsidies it bought with its shareholders' cash.

It's a mistake that Spotify just made, when it pursued its podcast exclusivity strategy, blowing more than a billion dollars buying up podcasts and then locking them up inside Spotify's walled garden, unreachable unless you use Spotify's client - other podcatchers need not apply:

&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/spotify-podcast-revenue-loss-2022-1235288180/"&gt;https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/spotify-podcast-revenue-loss-2022-1235288180/&lt;/a&gt;

It's easy to see why Spotify liked this idea. Real podcasts are as open as you could want - encoded in the open MP3 standard, distributed over the open RSS standard - and can be subscribed to and played back by any client. There's no practical way to spy on podcast listeners, nor to enshittify their experience in other ways, say, by blocking ad-skipping.

For eshittification-thirsty corporate sociopaths, this user-centric openness is a bug, not a feature. Apple was the first company to try to enclose podcasts, but while it dominated the sector, it never controlled it fully, not least because anyone could leave Apple's walled garden and subscribe to the same podcasts using another client with just a couple clicks. Competition disciplines companies.

Disciplined by competition and the ease of user switching, the podcast-encloser brigade have proceeded with caution - even where they publish their own podcasts, they haven't tried to make them exclusive to their walled gardens, instead offering real podcast feeds that anyone could subscribe to. One notable - and shameful - exception is the BBC, which has abandoned its leadership on open standards and open protocols and moved its flagship podcasts inside its proprietary BBC Sounds app, presumably because this will help it commericalize its offerings for non-license-fee-payers (part of the long transformation of the BBC from a Public Service Broadcaster focused on Reithian values to a glorified streaming service for Americans, a transformation that started when the BBC killed the Creative Archive in favor of the Iplayer).

Where others were cautious, Spotify was reckless. It bought popular podcasts and podcast networks, then severely enshittified their programs by locking them inside Spotify's walled garden. Audience numbers plummeted, demoralizing podcast creators who were uninterested in the future date when Spotify and its Magic Underpants Gnomes would figure out how to wring more money out of the tiny cohort that stuck around.

Today, podcast advertising rates are falling off a cliff. Short on users and ad dollars, Spotify's enshittification plan is looking like a self-inflicted wound. Even the Obamas cancelled their deal and switched to Audible, a monopolist that leads the world in enshittification but who had the good sense not to make its podcasts platform-exclusive:

&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/obamas-audible-deal-spotify-1235299775/"&gt;https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/obamas-audible-deal-spotify-1235299775/&lt;/a&gt;

Writing in Variety, Tyler Aquilina pens a eulogy for podcast exclusivity, quoting Parcast Union and  Gimlet Union, the unions for Spotify acquisitions Gimlet and Parcast: "[exlusives] caused a steep drop in listeners — as high as three quarters of the audience for some shows."

&lt;a href="https://variety.com/vip/podcast-exclusivity-is-quickly-becoming-an-outdated-strategy-1235495652/"&gt;https://variety.com/vip/podcast-exclusivity-is-quickly-becoming-an-outdated-strategy-1235495652/&lt;/a&gt;

That is a hell of a rush for the exits. What's more, podcasts that &lt;em&gt;leave&lt;/em&gt; Spotify's walled garden - after their exclusive deals expire - &lt;em&gt;gain&lt;/em&gt; listeners (though not as many as they lost).

Podcasting is an open technology built out of open technologies. We have damned few of those left. The openness of podcasts once allowed wild experimentation, with new kinds of audio made by new kinds of creators finding new kinds of audiences.

The drive to enshittify, unfettered by regulation or competition, has allowed many of the world's largest, stupidest tech companies to unhinge their jaws and tempt podcast makers and listeners to traipse blithely onto their slathering tongues. They were &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; going to snap their jaws shut eventually - just because Spotify lacked the executive function to wait for a fully ripened enshittification before biting down, it doesn't mean we're out of the woods.

&lt;h1&gt;Red Team Blues excerpt (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/27/enshittification-resistance/#one-last-job"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

My next novel is &lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt;, a noir technothriller/heist novel about Marty Hench, a forensic accountant who is the most fearsome financial sleuth in Silicon Valley history. Marty has spent 40 years unwinding tech's biggest, sleaziest scams, and now he's ready to retire - but first he has to do one more job:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/13/marty-hench/#red-team-blues"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/13/marty-hench/#red-team-blues&lt;/a&gt;

If you'd like an essay-formatted version of this thread to read or share, here's a link to it on pluralistic.net, my surveillance-free, ad-free, tracker-free blog:

My publisher, Tor Books, has just published the first sneak-peek at &lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt;, an exclusive excerpt from Chapter 4, where Marty explains to his old friend Raza why he's doing this job, and she helps him figure out how to crack it:

&lt;a href="https://www.torforgeblog.com/2023/01/26/excerpt-red-team-blues-by-cory-doctorow/"&gt;https://www.torforgeblog.com/2023/01/26/excerpt-red-team-blues-by-cory-doctorow/&lt;/a&gt;

I haven't been this excited about a book since 2006, when &lt;em&gt;Little Brother&lt;/em&gt; battered its way out of my fingertips in eight weeks flat (the first draft of &lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt; took only &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; weeks!). Tor agreed - they bought this book and two prequels: &lt;em&gt;The Bezzle&lt;/em&gt; (about private prison tech) and &lt;em&gt;Picks and Shovels&lt;/em&gt; (about affinity scams in the heroic age of the PC).

The early reviews have been spectacular: &lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; got there first, calling it "Another winner from an sf wizard who has always proved himself adept at blending genres for both adults and teens."

Next was &lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;, who wrote, "This absorbing and ruthless cyberpunk thriller from Doctorow tackles modern concerns involving cryptocurrency, security, and the daunting omnipotence of technology."

&lt;a href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/review/red-team-blues-1794647"&gt;https://www.libraryjournal.com/review/red-team-blues-1794647&lt;/a&gt;

Then came &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, with "Doctorow brings a thoroughness and honesty to a subject masked by techno-babble and emotional hype ('all that blockchain for good shit') to deliver a clear-eyed warning about how crypto is used (money laundering) and what it costs (billions of tons of CO2)."

I can't wait for this one to drop in April!

&lt;h1&gt;Excuseflation (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

The decision to pass modest sums out to working people to prevent them from starving or losing their homes during the covid lockdowns made the right furious, especially inflation hawks who insist that any improvement in everyday people's material lives will transform America into an amateur revival of Weimar, complete with wheelbarrows full of useless bank-notes.

"Democrats" like Larry Summers - a Clintonite ghoul who is on record as saying that women are biologically incapable of doing science - insisted that preserving workers' living standards was a terrible mistake, only prolonging the inevitable day when they would be shoveled into the furnace that keeps The Economy running.

And indeed, the lockdowns &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; followed by a series of price rises. Some of these were obviously the result of capacity problems:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/01/factories-to-condos-pipeline/#stuff-not-money"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/01/factories-to-condos-pipeline/#stuff-not-money&lt;/a&gt;

Cars got more expensive because panicked car executives canceled their microchip orders. That's a problem, because they redesigned our cars to be mobile surveillance platforms stuffed full of anti-repair digital locks, which means that cars need dozens of chips just to function:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms&lt;/a&gt;

As a result, fully assembled, chipless cars piled up in warehouses around the world, inert and immobile, awaiting the breath of life to be kindled by semiconductors. At one point, car makers even bought up &lt;em&gt;washing machines&lt;/em&gt; to shell them for the chips inside, discarding the husk of the machine:

&lt;a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/desperate-times-companies-buy-washing-machines-just-to-rip-out-the-chips-187033.html"&gt;https://www.autoevolution.com/news/desperate-times-companies-buy-washing-machines-just-to-rip-out-the-chips-187033.html&lt;/a&gt;

With fewer cars being made, and some cars being scrapped or retired, there was more demand than supply, and car prices rose, temporarily. This is obviously a &lt;em&gt;capacity&lt;/em&gt; problem, not a &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt; problem. Working people don't cause capacity problems. &lt;em&gt;Bosses do&lt;/em&gt;: by selling off buffer stocks, eliminating redundancies and safety margins, and chasing lax labor and environmental regulations to the corners of the world, stretching out supply chains across vast distances.

But not all the price rises were temporary, nor could they all be attributed to supply shocks. Reporters who tuned into earnings calls from large, monopolistic packaged goods companies like Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever and Procter and Gamble were amazed to hear CEOs and CFOs boasting about how they were able to use the &lt;em&gt;excuse&lt;/em&gt; of inflation to raise prices:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering&lt;/a&gt;

Talk about saying the quiet part out loud! Here's the eminently guillotineable Colgate CEO Noel Wallace: "What we are very good at is pricing." Or the tumbril-ready Kroger CEO Gary Millerchip: "We’ve been very comfortable with our ability to pass on the increases that we’ve seen at this point, and we would expect that to continue to be the case."

Despite the CEOs literally &lt;em&gt;boasting in public&lt;/em&gt; about how they were able to raise prices far in excess of any increase in their costs and rake in windfall profits, neoclassic economists kept pushing their perfectly spherical cows of uniform density around on their frictionless planes, insisting that the models predicted that this was impossible, therefore it wasn't happening.

Specifically, establishment economists claimed that since market concentration hadn't increased significantly over two years, that the inflation seen over that point couldn't be blamed on monopolies. But as Hal Singer wrote, that's not how monopolies raise prices: they wait for &lt;em&gt;excuses&lt;/em&gt; to price-gouge, and then they use their market power to make us all poorer:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#overinflated"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#overinflated&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Two thirds&lt;/em&gt; of US companies increased their margins over the first two years of the pandemic. Prices didn't go up because poor people overspent their CARES Act money. Inflation wasn't just a matter of supply-shocks. I accuse monopolies, in the economy, with the profiteering:

&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-yellen-biden-price-increase-cost-shipping-supply-chain-labor-shortage-pandemic-11636934826"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-yellen-biden-price-increase-cost-shipping-supply-chain-labor-shortage-pandemic-11636934826&lt;/a&gt;

There is no evidence of a "wage-price spiral." Wage growth peaked in June at 4.8% and by October it had declined to 4.2%, making real wages 2.3% lower than they were in Oct 2021. As Joseph Stiglitz and Regmi Ira wrote for the Roosevelt Institute last December, "Weak unions, globalization, and changes in the structure of the economy" mean that workers generally can't demand inflation-tracking wage increases:

&lt;a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RI_CausesofandResponsestoTodaysInflation_Report_202212.pdf"&gt;https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RI_CausesofandResponsestoTodaysInflation_Report_202212.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

Stiglitz and Ira lay out five causes of inflation: energy and food spikes, changes in what we want, supply interruptions, higher rents - and price-gouging (notably, none of these can be fixed by jacking up the interest rate at the central bank).

As the Stiglitz/Ira list of five causes shows, it's not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; price-fixing that causes prices to go up - but every one of these causes feeds into price-fixing, thanks to a phenomenon called excuseflation, which Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal discuss in the latest OddLots podcast:

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/corporate-earnings-calls-provide-clues-on-inflation-odd-lots-podcast"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/corporate-earnings-calls-provide-clues-on-inflation-odd-lots-podcast&lt;/a&gt;

In the accompanying &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article, Alloway and Weisenthal run down innumerable examples in which executives boast about how real crises - war, climate events, blockages in the Suez Canal, bird flu - provide ready-made excuses for raising prices and then keeping them high:

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/how-excuseflation-is-keeping-prices-and-corporate-profits-high"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/how-excuseflation-is-keeping-prices-and-corporate-profits-high&lt;/a&gt;

Take Ken Jarosch, owner of Chicago's Jarosch Bakery, who told investors, "Whether it’s rye flour, or bird flu that impacts eggs, when it makes national news, just running a business, it’s an opportunity to increase the prices without getting a whole bunch of complaining from the customers":

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-22/transcript-what-a-bakery-can-tell-us-about-the-economy-right-now"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-22/transcript-what-a-bakery-can-tell-us-about-the-economy-right-now&lt;/a&gt;

The analyst Samuel Rines describes this as a "Price Over Volume" (POV) strategy: companies know that if they raise prices, they'll sell fewer goods, because many working people won't be able to afford their products. But - thanks to inequality - these merchants can make up the losses by extracting much larger sums from the professional and managerial class.

Rines singles out several large American companies as hotspots of POV: Pepsi, Home Depot, and even discounters like Walmart and Dollar Tree. POV makes everyone worse off: low-income people are priced out of the market, and high-income people are ripped off. Only the shareholders benefit.

Take Pepsi: after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Pepsi pulled out of Russia. But its profits remained steady, because Pepsi was able to raise its prices in the rest of the world - blaming the war, of course. Rines calls this PPP: Pepsi Pricing Power. The pitchfork-friendly Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta describes this as "trying to create brands that can stand for higher value to consumers and consumers are willing to pay more for our brands."

&lt;a href="https://investors.pepsico.com/docs/default-source/investors/q3-2022/q3-2022-pep_transcript_r9ltxf2sicuqx5kn.pdf"&gt;https://investors.pepsico.com/docs/default-source/investors/q3-2022/q3-2022-pep_transcript_r9ltxf2sicuqx5kn.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

(Why don't customers switch to Coke? It turns out that duopolies like Pepsi-Coke are able to tacitly collude on pricing, and Coke is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; raking in massive profits.)

UMass Amherst economists Isabella Weber and Evan Wasner call this "sellers inflation," documenting how "overlapping emergencies" allow companies to raise prices far in excess of their cost increases, and then keep them high even when the emergencies end:

&lt;a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/econ_workingpaper/343/"&gt;https://scholarworks.umass.edu/econ_workingpaper/343/&lt;/a&gt;

Take Wingstop, whose chicken prices have shot up by 125% in a year, with "zero pushback from the consumer." Wholesale chicken prices are down 50%, but Wingstop's prices are still high, and its stock is up 250% from its Covid crisis low.

The power of excuseflation is that it allows apologists to, well, make excuses. When egg prices shot up in January, Big Egg was able to blame it all on bird-flu. There really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a bird-flu problem, but there's also a single company that sells all the eggs: Cal-Maine foods, a monopolist that increased its margins by &lt;em&gt;110%&lt;/em&gt; in a single year. Wholesale prices stabilized, but prices kept going up, and CALM's share price climbed by 47%:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on&lt;/a&gt;

CALM owns nearly every egg brand you've ever heard of: Farmhouse Eggs, Sunups, Sunny Meadow, Egg-Land’s Best and Land O’ Lakes eggs and more. When all those brands' prices shot up - conventional eggs hit $2.88/doz in Jan, a 100% increase over Jan 2022 - that was just one company raising prices.

If the price spikes were caused solely by bird flu, then you'd expect margins to &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt;, not rise. But bird-flu was the &lt;em&gt;excuse&lt;/em&gt; for eggflation, not the cause.

&lt;h1&gt;California to smash prison e-profiteers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/08/captive-audience/#good-at-their-jobs"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

It's a double-whammy that defines 21st century American life: a corporation gets caught doing something terrible, exploitative or even murderous, and a government agency steps in - only to discover that there's nothing it can do, because Reagan/Trump/Clinton/Bush I/Bush II deregulated that industry and stripped the agency of enforcement powers.

If you'd like an essay-formatted version of this post to read or share, here's a link to it on pluralistic.net, my surveillance-free, ad-free, tracker-free blog:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/08/captive-audience/#good-at-their-jobs"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/08/captive-audience/#good-at-their-jobs&lt;/a&gt;

Man, that feels &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;. The idea that extremists gutted our democratically accountable institutions so that there's &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; they can do, no matter how egregious a corporation's conduct is so demoralizing. Makes me feel like giving up.

But the law is a complex and mysterious thing. Regulators aren't &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; helpless. There are authorities, powers and systems that the corporate wreckers passed over, failed to notice, or failed to neuter. Take Section 5 of the FTC Act, which gives the Commission broad powers to prevent "unfair and deceptive" practices. Since the &lt;em&gt;1970s&lt;/em&gt;, the FTC just acted like this didn't exist, even though it was right there all along, between Section 4 and Section 6.

Then, under the directorship of FTC chair Lina Khan, Section 5 was rediscovered and mobilized, first to end the practice of noncompete "agreements" for workers nationwide:

&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/antitrust-enforcers-to-ban-indentured"&gt;https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/antitrust-enforcers-to-ban-indentured&lt;/a&gt;

A new breed of supremely competent, progressive regulators are dusting off those old lawbooks and figuring out what powers they have, and they're &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; those powers to Get Stuff Done. It's like that old joke:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Office manager: $75 to kick the photocopier?
  
  Repair person: No, it's $5 to kick the photocopier, $70 to know where to kick it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There's a whole generation of expert photocopier-kickers in public life, and they've got their boots on:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/18/administrative-competence/#i-know-stuff"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/18/administrative-competence/#i-know-stuff&lt;/a&gt;

This is the upside of technocracy - where you have people who are appointed to do good things, and who want to do good things, and who figure out how to do good things. There are dormant powers &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; in law. Remember when Southwest Air stranded a million passengers over Christmas week and Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg responded by talking sternly about doing better, but without opening any enforcement actions against SWA?

At the time, Buttigieg's defenders said that was all he &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do: "Pete isn't the boss of Southwest's IT department, you know!" He's not - but he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in possession of identical powers to the FTC to regulate "unfair and deceptive" practices, thanks to USC40 Section 41712(a), which copy-pastes the language from Article 5 of the FTC Act into the DOT's legislative basis:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge&lt;/a&gt;

The failures of SWA were a long time coming, and were driven by the company's shifting of costs from shareholders to employees and fliers. SWA schedules many flights for which they have no aircraft or crew, and when the time to fly those jets comes, the company simply cancels the emptiest flights. This is great for SWA's shareholders, who don't have to pay for fuel and crew for half-empty planes - but it's terrible for crew and fliers.

What's more, selling tickets for planes that don't exist is &lt;em&gt;plainly&lt;/em&gt; unfair and deceptive. A good photocopier-kicker in charge of the DOT would have arrived with a "first 100 days" plan that included opening hearings into this practice, as a prelude to directly regulating this conduct out of existence, averting the worst aviation scheduling crisis in US history. That's what Buttigieg's critics wanted from him: a competent assessment of his powers, followed by the vigorous use of those powers to protect the American people.

One domain that's been in sore need of a photocopier-kicker for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; is prison tech. America ("the land of the free") incarcerates more people than any nation in the history of the world - more than the USSR, more than China, more than Apartheid-era South Africa.

For corporate prison profiteers, those prisoners are a literal captive audience, easy pickings for gouging on telephone calls, books, music, and food. For years, companies like Securus have been behind an incredibly imaginative array of sadistic tactics that strip prisoners of the contact, education and nutrition that governments normally provide to incarcerated people, and then sells those prisoners and their families poor substitutes for those necessities at markups that cost many multiples of the equivalent services in the free world.

Think of prisons that reduce the amount of food served to sub-starvation levels, then sell food at high markups in the prison commissary. For prisoners whose families can afford commissary fees, this is merely extortion. But for prisoners who don't have anyone to top up their commissary accounts, it's literal starvation.

This is the shape of every prison profiteer's grift: take something vital away and then sell it back at a massive markup, dooming the prisoners who can't afford it. The most obvious way to gouge prisoners is by charging huge markups for phone calls. Prisoners who can afford to pay many dollars per minute can stay in touch with their families, while the rest rot in isolation.

In 2015, the FCC tried to halt this practice, passing an order capping the price of calls, but in 2017, the DC District Court struck down the order, ruling that the FCC couldn't regulate in-state call tariffs, which are the majority of prison calls:

&lt;a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0/C62A026B396DD4C78525813E004F3BC5/%24file/15-1461-1679364.pdf"&gt;https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0/C62A026B396DD4C78525813E004F3BC5/%24file/15-1461-1679364.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

This was a bonanza for prison profiteers. Companies like Jpay (now a division of Securus) cranked up the price of prisoners' calls. At the same time, dark-money lobbying campaigns urged prisons to get rid of their in-person visitation programs in the name of "safety":

&lt;a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/142779/the-end-of-prison-visitation"&gt;https://www.mic.com/articles/142779/the-end-of-prison-visitation&lt;/a&gt;

Not just visitation: prisons shuttered their libraries and banned shipments of letters, cards and books - again, in the same of "safety." Jpay an its competitors stepped in with "free tablets" - cheap, badly made Chinese tablets. Instead of checking out books from the prison library or having them mailed to you by a friend or family member, prisoners had to buy DRM-locked ebooks at many multiples of the outside world price (these same prices were slapped on public domain books ganked from Project Gutenberg):

&lt;a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2018/07/24/no-cost-contract/"&gt;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2018/07/24/no-cost-contract/&lt;/a&gt;

Instead of getting letters and cards from your family members and friends, you had to pay to look at scans of them, buying "virtual stamps" that had to accompany every page (they even charged by the "page" for text messages):

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/jpay-securus-prison-email-charging-millions/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/jpay-securus-prison-email-charging-millions/&lt;/a&gt;

Enshittification is my name for service-decay, where companies that have some kind of lock-in make things worse and worse for their customers, secure in the knowledge that they'll keep paying because the lock-in keeps them from leaving. When your customers are &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; locked in (that is, behind bars), the enshittification comes fast and furious.

Securus/Jpay and its competitors found all kinds of ways to make their services worse, like harvesting recordings of their calls to produce biometric voice-prints that could be used to track prisoners after they were released:

&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/01/30/prison-voice-prints-databases-securus/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2019/01/30/prison-voice-prints-databases-securus/&lt;/a&gt;

Of course, once the prison phone-carriers started harvesting prisoners' phone calls, it was inevitable that they would leak those calls, including intimate calls with family members and privileged calls with lawyers:

&lt;a href="https://www.aaronswartzday.org/securedrop-prisoner-data/"&gt;https://www.aaronswartzday.org/securedrop-prisoner-data/&lt;/a&gt;

Prison-tech companies know they can extract huge fortunes from their captive audience, so they are shameless about offering bribes (ahem, "profit-sharing") to prison authorities and sheriffs' offices to switch vendors. When that happens, prisoners inevitably suffer, as happened in 2018, when Florida state prisons changed tech providers and wiped out $11.8m worth of prisoners purchased media - every song prisoners had paid for:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/captive-audience-how-floridas-prisons-and-drm-made-113m-worth-prisoners-music"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/captive-audience-how-floridas-prisons-and-drm-made-113m-worth-prisoners-music&lt;/a&gt;

As bad as these deals are for prisoners, they're great for jailers, who are personally and institutionally enriched by prison-tech giants. This is textbook corruption, in which small groups of individuals are enriched while vast, diffuse costs are extracted from large groups of people. Naturally, the deals themselves are swathed in secrecy, and public records requests for their details are met with blank, illegal refusals:

&lt;a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2018/may/25/laramie-county-prison-phones/"&gt;https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2018/may/25/laramie-county-prison-phones/&lt;/a&gt;

The "shitty technology adoption curve" predicts that technological harms that are first visited upon prisoners and other low-privilege people will gradually work its way up the privilege gradient:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/29/impunity-corrodes/#arise-ye-prisoners"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/29/impunity-corrodes/#arise-ye-prisoners&lt;/a&gt;

Securus &lt;em&gt;powered&lt;/em&gt; up the Shitty Tech Adoption Curve. They don't just spy on and exploit prisoners - they leveraged that surveillance empire into a line of product lines that touch us &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. Securus transformed their prisoner telephone tracking business into an off-the-books, warrantless tracking tool that cops everywhere use to illegally track people:

&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/cellphone-tracking-law-enforcement.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/cellphone-tracking-law-enforcement.html&lt;/a&gt;

In other words, our jails and prisons are incubators that breed digital pathogens that infect all of us eventually. It's past time we got in the exterminators and flushed out those nests.

That's where California's new photocopier-kickers come in. Like many states, California has a Public Utility Commission (PUC), which regulates private companies that provide utilities, like telecoms. That means that the state of California can reach into every jail and prison in the state and grab the prison profiteers by the throats and toss 'em out the window.

Writing in &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, Kalena Thomhave does an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; job on the technical ins-and-outs of calling on PUCs to regulate prison-tech, both in California and in other states where PUCs haven't yet been neutered or eliminated by deregulation-crazed Republicans:

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/justice/2023-05-08-california-prison-phone-calls-free/"&gt;https://prospect.org/justice/2023-05-08-california-prison-phone-calls-free/&lt;/a&gt;

Thomhave describes how California's county sheriffs have waxed fat on kickbacks from the prison-tech sector: "for example, the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office receives 25 percent of GTL/ViaPath’s gross revenue on video calls made from tablets."  Small wonder that sheriffs' offices lobby against free calls from jail, claiming that prisoners' phone tariffs are needed to fund their operations.

It's true that the majority of this kickback money (51%) goes into "inmate welfare funds," but these funds don't have to go to inmates - they can and are diverted to "maintenance, salaries, travel, and equipment like security cameras."

But limiting contact between prisoners and their families in order to pay for operating expenses is a foolish bargain. Isolation from friends and family is closely linked to recidivism. If we want prisoners to live productive lives after their serve their time, we should maximize their contact with the outside, not link it to their families' ability to spend 50 times more per minute than anyone making a normal call.

The covid lockdowns were a boon to prison-tech profiteers, whose video-calling products were used to replace in-person visits. But when pandemic restrictions lifted, the in-person visits didn't come back. Instead, jails continued to ban in-person visits and replace them with expensive video calls.

Even with new power, the FCC can't directly regulate this activity, especially not in county jails. But PUCs can. Not every state has a PUC: ALEC, the right-wing legislation factory, has pushed laws that gut or eliminate PUCs across the country:

&lt;a href="https://alec.org/model-policy/telecommunications-deregulation-policy-statement/"&gt;https://alec.org/model-policy/telecommunications-deregulation-policy-statement/&lt;/a&gt;

But California has a PUC, and it is gathering information now in advance of an order that could rein in these extractive businesses and halt the shitty tech adoption curve in its tracks:

&lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M478/K075/478075894.PDF"&gt;https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M478/K075/478075894.PDF&lt;/a&gt;

That's some top-notch photocopier-kicking, right there.

&lt;h1&gt;Ireland's privacy regulator is a gamekeeper-turned-poacher (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze#dirty-old-town"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

When the EU passed its landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it seemed like a privacy miracle. Despite the most aggressive lobbying Europe had ever seen, 500 million Europeans were now guaranteed a digital private life. Could this really be?

Well, yes...and no. Despite flaws (Right to Be Forgotten), the GDPR has strong, well-crafted, badly needed privacy protections. But to get those protections, Europeans need their privacy regulators to enforce the rules.

That's where the GDPR miracle founders. Europe includes several tax-havens - Malta, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland - that compete to offer the most favorable terms to international corporations and other criminals. For these havens, paying little to no tax is just table-stakes. As these countries vie to sell themselves out to giant companies, they compete to offer a favorable regulatory environment, insulating companies from lawsuits over corruption, labor abuses and other crimes.

All of this is made possible - and even encouraged - by the design of European federalism, which lets companies easily shift which flag of convenience they fly. Once a company re-homes in a country, it can force Europeans across the union to seek justice in that country's courts, under the looming threat that the company will up sticks for another haven if the law doesn't bend over backwards to protect corporate citizens from the grievances of flesh-and-blood humans.

Big Tech's most aggressive privacy invaders have long flown Irish flags. Ireland is "headquarters" to Google, Meta, Tinder, Apple, Airbnb, Yahoo and many other tech companies. In exchange for locating a handful of jobs to Ireland, these companies are allowed to maintain the pretense that their global earnings are afloat in the Irish Sea, in a state of perfect, untaxable grace.

That cozy relationship meant that the US tech giants were well-situated to sabotage Ireland's privacy regulator, who would be the first port of call for Europeans whose privacy had been violated by American firms. For many years, it's been obvious that the Irish Data Protection Commission was a sleeping watchdog, with infinite tolerance for the companies that pretend to make Ireland their homes. &lt;em&gt;87%&lt;/em&gt; of Irish data protection claims involve just eight giant US companies (that pretend to be Irish).

But even among hardened GDPR warriors, the real extent of the Data Protection Commissioner's uselessness is genuinely shocking. A new report from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties reveals that the DPC isn't merely tolerant of privacy crimes, they're gamekeepers turned poachers, active collaborators in privacy abuse:

&lt;a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-years-GDPR-crisis.pdf"&gt;https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-years-GDPR-crisis.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

The report's headline figure really tells the story: the European Data Protection Board - which oversees Ireland's DPC - overturns the Irish regulator's judgments &lt;em&gt;75% of the time&lt;/em&gt;. It's actually worse than it appears: that figure only includes appeals of the DPC's enforcement actions, where the DPC bestirred itself to put on trousers and show up for work to investigate a privacy claim, only to find that the corporation was utterly blameless.

But the DPC almost never takes enforcement actions. Instead, the regulator remains in its pajamas, watching cartoons and eating breakfast cereal, and offers an "amicable resolution" (that is, a settlement) to the accused company. 83% of the cases brought before the DPC are settled with an "amicable resolution."

Corporations can bargain for multiple, consecutive amicable resolutions, allowing them to repeatedly break the law and treat the fines - which they negotiate themselves - as part of the price of doing business.

This is illegal. European law demands that cases that involve repeat offenders, or that are likely to affect many people, &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be fully investigated.

Ireland's government has stonewalled on calls for an independent review of the DPC. The DPC continues to abet lawlessness, allowing corporations to use privacy invasive techniques for surveillance, discrimination and manipulation. In 2022, the DPC concluded 64% of its cases with mere reprimands - not even a slap on the wrist.

Meanwhile, the DPC trails the EU in issuing "compliance orders" - which directly regulate the conduct of privacy-invading companies - only issuing &lt;em&gt;49&lt;/em&gt; such orders in the past 4.5 years. The DPC has only issued &lt;em&gt;28&lt;/em&gt; of the GDPR's "one-stop-shop" fines.

The EU has 26 other national privacy regulators, but under the GDPR, they aren't allowed to act until the DPC delivers its draft decisions. The DPC is lavishly funded, with a budget in the EU's top five, but all that money gets pissed up against a wall, with inaction ruling the day.

Despite the collusion between the tech giants and the Irish state, time is running out for America's surveillance-crazed tech monopolists. The GDPR &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; allow Europeans to challenge the DPR's do-nothing rulings in European court, after a long, meandering process. That process is finally bearing fruit: in 2021, Johnny Ryan and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties brought a case in Germany against the ad-tech lobby group IAB:

And the activist Max Schrems and the group NOYB brought a case against Google in Austria:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/#noyb"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/#noyb&lt;/a&gt;

But Europeans should not have to drag tech giants out of Ireland to get justice. It's long past time for the EU to force Ireland to clean up its act. The EU Commission is set to publish a proposal on how to reform Ireland's DPA, but more muscular action is needed. In the new report, the Irish Council For Civil Liberties calls on the European Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, to treat this issue with the urgency and seriousness that it warrants. As the ICCL says, "the EU can not be a regulatory superpower unless it enforces its own laws."

Welcome to my Saturday linkdump, the third in an occasional series that may or may not be restricted to Saturdays, but which will ever be a celebration of olde-timey linkblogging of the sort practiced by our blogfathers, blogmothers, and assorted other blogparents:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/&lt;/a&gt;

Any fule kno that Saturday is Caturday, and today's woke felinism comes courtesy of Dr Eleanor Janega, the earthiest of all the Medievalist Bloggers, author of the superb &lt;em&gt;Once and Future Sex&lt;/em&gt;, all about dirty dirty medieval people and their filthy filthy habits:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/17/ren-faire/#going-medieval"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/17/ren-faire/#going-medieval&lt;/a&gt;

One of Janega's winningest formulas is "Find a dopey thing about medieval people racing around social media and then set the ignorant straight in a world-beating, &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; well-informed rant."

See, for example, "I assure you, medieval people bathed":

&lt;a href="https://going-medieval.com/2019/08/02/i-assure-you-medieval-people-bathed/"&gt;https://going-medieval.com/2019/08/02/i-assure-you-medieval-people-bathed/&lt;/a&gt;

This week, Janega addresses herself to the burning question, "Did 14th C religious leaders label cats evil, precipitating a mass European cull of poor moggies?"

The answer, you will not be surprised to learn, is: "No."

&lt;a href="https://going-medieval.com/2023/05/16/on-cats/"&gt;https://going-medieval.com/2023/05/16/on-cats/&lt;/a&gt;

Rather, medieval people - including those in the 14th century - just &lt;em&gt;adored&lt;/em&gt; cats. That goes double for the religious leaders, as is evidenced by all the cats monks drew in the margins of religious manuscripts. Janega also reproduces painstakingly inked manuscripts crisscrossed by pawprints left by a cat that did the medieval version of walking back and forth over your keyboard while you're trying to enter your password.

There's also a manuscript with a large blotch that is labeled by a monk who identifies it as a piss-stain left behind by a cat (presumably a cat that wanted to go out and was tired of the monk not taking the walking-back-and-forth-over-the-manuscript hint).

In case there's any doubt about how monks felt about cats, there's a freaking &lt;em&gt;adorable&lt;/em&gt; manuscript margin-doodle of cat in a little monk's outfit. There's doodles of cats with nuns, illustrations of cats hanging out with 14th century monks, and of course, drawings of working cats keeping down the rats in the barns and kitchens of the day.

As if that wasn't enough, Janega closes with this banger: 14th century didn't kill all their cats in a witch panic, because "&lt;em&gt;witch panics are not a feature of medieval society&lt;/em&gt;":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Indeed, medieval people didn’t really believe in the concept at all. Even in the fifteenth century when the Malleus Maleficarum, or Hammer of Witches, a witch-hunting guide was written it had to justify its very existence because no one believed that ol’ Heinrich Kramer was right about witches existing.
  
  When people think that the Middle Ages is a place full of superstitious backwards religious fanatics it allows them to think they can just ignore over a thousand years of history because all you are going to see is disease and cat murder. This then allows stupid ideas like this to perpetuate and exacerbates the problem further. Suddenly the only people paying attention to medieval history are weirdo trad people who can bend the truth to suit their own aims, and baby, we cannot have that.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Happy caturday all, and especially to Dr Janega, may her quill never blunt.

Caturday - even a caturday about people being Very Wrong About Cats - is a reminder that the internet is often great, and not a cesspit of awful. Here is one way in which that is true: Mohit Bhoite builds tiny, perfect electronic sculptures that are both gorgeous little artworks and supremely functional exemplars of the hardware hacker's noble art:

&lt;a href="https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/"&gt;https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/&lt;/a&gt;

Oh. My. God. These are so great. The tiny temperature monitor with the 7-seg digital display:

&lt;a href="https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/tiny-temp-monitor/"&gt;https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/tiny-temp-monitor/&lt;/a&gt;

This stunning 7-seg counter:

&lt;a href="https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/seven-segment-counter/"&gt;https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/seven-segment-counter/&lt;/a&gt;

This 555 Demux, with its delicate tracery of chassis and pins:

&lt;a href="https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/555-bcd-demux/"&gt;https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/555-bcd-demux/&lt;/a&gt;

Each one a delightful morsel, made seemingly for the artist's own pleasure and self-expression. I'm slightly disappointed that these aren't for sale (because I want &lt;em&gt;all of them&lt;/em&gt;), but even happier that these are pure works of art, unsullied by commerce.

An important note about Bhoite's sculptures is that they're built on open source hardware, notably kits from Adafruit, often based on Arduinos and other open designs. This openness leads to "generativity," the ability of follow-on creators and inventors to make new things based on existing things.

Generativity is the heart of the early explosive growth of the internet. From "view source" teaching millions of us to make the web to the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, Mysql and python/perl) forming the substrate for billions of projects, the generative internet was - and is - the creative internet.

Despite a decade of energetic commons-enclosing, some of the staunchest bastions of openness and generativity continue to thrive, like Wikipedia, an encyclopedia that isn't just "free as in beer," it's also "free as in speech" - free to mix and remix as you choose.

Here's a whole passel of delightful Wikipedia-generated search tools, the Search Gizmos, a whole suite of special-purpose search tools that mine Wikipedia for informational goodies:

&lt;a href="https://searchgizmos.com/"&gt;https://searchgizmos.com/&lt;/a&gt;

They're the creation of Tara Calishain, and there are so many of them that's it's hard to choose just one to highlight, but I'm enormously fond of "Gossip Machine":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  A powerful tool that uses Wikipedia page views to surface potential “news days” in a given year for any topic with a Wikipedia page. By analyzing daily page views and flagging dates with significantly higher-than-average views, Gossip Machine provides you with pre-filled Google News and Google Web search links, taking you straight to valuable and insightful information about your chosen topic.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the bitter ironies of companies like Open AI is the co-opting of generativity for "Generative AI," a set of products that could not be more unlike the generative projects of Bhoite or Calishain.

This kind of language game is a hallmark of every scam (not for nothing: Open AI isn't open, and its product is neither artificial nor is it intelligent). As debates over "Generative AI" (which neither "generative," nor "artificial," etc, etc) rage, it's worth revisiting how earlier debates about automation, creativity and appropriation played out.

This week in &lt;em&gt;Clot Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, Estela Oliva interviews electronic music pioneers Jennifer Walshe and Jon "Wobbly" Leidecker (Negativland):

&lt;a href="https://clotmag.com/interviews/jennifer-walshe-jon-leidecker-on-collaboration"&gt;https://clotmag.com/interviews/jennifer-walshe-jon-leidecker-on-collaboration&lt;/a&gt;

The whole interview is great, but it really starts to smoke when Leidecker describes "Morover" a Negativland project built on samples of billionaires' own fevered rants about AI:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  With Negativland, we sample those CEO quotes directly – with Jennifer, those quotes also wind up in her notebooks, which she uses live as a source – it turns out CEO &amp;amp; EA musings make for an excellent libretto.  Our deliverable is the ecosystem itself!  Image diversity is more useful than photorealism!  Sometimes the original sample is unbeatable, such as when Sam Altman’s voice falters when he says he feels terrible that AI is the reason his Rationalist friends have decided not to have kids. He thinks in the future, so many jobs will be lost to AI that our economy will be forced to come up with new solutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, Leidecker digs into the meat of the debate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Electronic music has been dealing with issues of generative music and cybernetics since the 1940s, with Louis and Bebe Barron working out the creative potential of these new tools, making self-playing instruments capable of observing their own behaviour.  I take the core questions faced by creative electronic musicians to involve issues of automation.  What can be automated that points one in unheard musical directions?
  
  Can networks involve more people, as opposed to replacing them?  What new roles open up for humans once the old decisions are being handled?  Electronic music has over 70 years’ worth of deeply moral and very creative responses to the issue of automation, and these patent-chasing corporations aren’t likely to bring up any of that work during their product demos.  They need you to believe they invented this.  But there’s a long and helpful history, and there’s still time to learn it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are the interesting discussions we could be having about these tools, if we could stop letting mediocre billionaire live rent-free in our heads as they hold flashlights under their chins and intone "Aaaaaaaay Eyeeeeeeee" in their spookiest voices. These guys are pumping their upcoming dump, and all the biggest disaster-stories are part of the scam: "AI will become sentient" and "AI will do your job as well as you" are both statements whose primary purpose is to increase the value of the stock in companies making "AI" technology (neither "artificial" nor you get the idea).

I mean, sure, our bosses will fire our asses and replace us with shell-scripts, but they don't need &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; AI to do that - no more than they needed working voice response systems to replace human operators. They just enshittify their products and services, and do it under cover of chasing amazing new technology, and reap the stock gains bequeathed by keyword-drunk investors.

But the endless repetition of this vision of Fully Automated Austerity Pronatalist Space Neofeudalism gives people absolute &lt;em&gt;brain-worms&lt;/em&gt;. The entire passive-income/rise-and-grind subculture has been convinced that they can use AI (neither etc etc) to make a fortune by...uh...generating plausible paragraphs.

Only problem: there's no market for plausible paragraphs. The closest anyone comes is the tiny, low-dollar market for short science fiction and fantasy, which is pretty much the last bastion of paid short fiction markets. Now, these are amazing publications, and they do wonderful work, but they pay $0.01 to $0.25/word, and - more importantly - are edited by humans who sift through 1,000+ manuscripts per month looking for &lt;em&gt;brilliant&lt;/em&gt; work to publish.

These editors are handily capable of distinguishing between extruded verbal slurry and actual short fiction, but the brain-worm bros are convinced that if they hammer these editors hard enough with enough algorithm-wrought word-salad, eventually, they'll sell a "story" (netting a princely sum in the tens of dollars!).

This is objectively very stupid, but it's also very terrible, because the human editors doing this labor of love are &lt;em&gt;drowning in aishit&lt;/em&gt;. The most vocal among these LLM-blighted publishers is Neil Clarke, editor of the great Clarkesworld, who is waging a one-man war on spammy LLM submissions. His latest dispatch from the front lines (ominously titled "It continues…") would be hacky sf, if it wasn't real:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The one thing that is presently missing from the equation is integration with any of the existing AI detection tools. Despite their grand claims, we’ve found them to be stunningly unreliable, primitive, significantly overpriced, and easily outwitted by even the most basic of approaches.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="http://neil-clarke.com/it-continues/"&gt;http://neil-clarke.com/it-continues/&lt;/a&gt;

This is not the future we dreamt of. It's been stolen from us by the brain-worms. Writing in &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;, the great Nathan Proctor describes how automation lets companies bring about the "death of ownership":

&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-software-legal-tricks-subscriptions-customers-money-pay-death-ownership-2023-5"&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-software-legal-tricks-subscriptions-customers-money-pay-death-ownership-2023-5&lt;/a&gt;

When your device won't accept the ink you chose, or run the software you prefer, or let you repair it at the depot of your choosing (or even on your own kitchen table), do you really own it?

This is the theme of much of my work, of course, including my novella "Unauthorized Bread," which performs the science-fictional trick of building a world around a single technical conceit to magnify and clarify the underlying issues:

&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/&lt;/a&gt;

Proctor leads PIRG's Right to Repair campaign, and he's a comrade. He's got these companies' numbers and he's a tireless fighter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I believe in truth in advertising. If you're going to sell somebody something, sell it to them. If you are going to lease something to somebody, lease it to them. If you tether their future purchases to a secret "agreement" that you baked into the technology that they don't know about, that is deceptive. Not to mention, tinkering and fixing are American traditions. The ethos of "if it's broke, then fix it" has other benefits, too. Repair teaches critical skills, it saves consumers money, it helps cut waste and product obsolescence. Tinkering and fixing also leads to product innovations that can benefit everyone.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Preach on, brother!

For ever tech bro who took cyberpunk dystopia as a suggestion, there are a dozen more who took it as a warning. Technologists like Micah Lee are on the front lines with Proctor and others. Lee was my colleague at EFF when Snowden contacted him privately, identifying himself as a would-be whistleblower who was trying to securely deliver a trove of US government leaks to some journalists who were struggling with the technology.

Now Lee is at the Freedom of the Press Foundation and &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;, and he's working on a book: "Hacks, Leaks and Revelations," is a practical manual for whistleblowers, reporters and investigators. Subtitled "The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data," it's out in November:

&lt;a href="https://nostarch.com/hacks-leaks-and-revelations"&gt;https://nostarch.com/hacks-leaks-and-revelations&lt;/a&gt;

Meanwhile, Lee has put swathes of the book online for early perusal:

&lt;a href="https://staging.hacksandleaks.com/introduction.html"&gt;https://staging.hacksandleaks.com/introduction.html&lt;/a&gt;

This book isn't a mere manifesto - it's a manual, and it contains exercises for the reader to help them build a secure process for communicating and publishing in a way that protects sources.

Micah's work is a reminder that the internet is made of people. Take the people away, all you've got is algorithms spamming each other (this is the plot of my short story, "When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth"):

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/14/masque-of-the-red-death/#eschatology-watch"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/14/masque-of-the-red-death/#eschatology-watch&lt;/a&gt;

People matter. Everything people make - corporations, cities, workplaces, networks - only matter to the extent that they help people. Here's a useful rule of thumb: when you're trying to figure out whether a cause deserves your support, ask yourself, "Does this help people? Does it help more people than the alternative? Does it help people who need help?"

Asking that question made me a union man. That's why I've been walking the WGA picket-lines in my neighborhood on my home-days while touring. It's also why I cheered the dancers at LA's Star Garden Topless Dive Bar when they became the first topless dancers in America to win recognition for their union:

&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/strippers-union-los-angeles-star-garden-4069df93b149076dc2e23a0bff16438b"&gt;https://apnews.com/article/strippers-union-los-angeles-star-garden-4069df93b149076dc2e23a0bff16438b&lt;/a&gt;

The Star Garden workers are organized under the Actors’ Equity Association, the same union I wrote a check to when I paid Wil Wheaton to record the audiobook of &lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt; (Wil's a union man, too:)

&lt;a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1093201/jeopardy-wil-wheaton-ken-jennings-writers-strike/"&gt;https://www.tvinsider.com/1093201/jeopardy-wil-wheaton-ken-jennings-writers-strike/&lt;/a&gt;

There's been a lot of "ha ha the strippers unionized ha ha" nonsense in response to this news, but fuck that. Sex work is work. These are workers. They work in a field that is physically demanding, potentially dangerous, and rife with exploitative practices. Damned right they need a union. Go, sisters, go!

People who think they understand ironic laughter because they made a snotty remark about a stripper's union are absolute amateurs. To see how it's done, check out &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt;, a publication that is consistently &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; funny, but also reliably &lt;em&gt;screamingly, viciously, incredibly&lt;/em&gt; funny, especially about the things that hurt the most.

The canonical example of this, of course, is &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt;'s first issue after the 9/11 attacks, headlined "HOLY FUCKING SHIT" and containing such articles as "Not Knowing What Else To Do, Woman Bakes American-Flag Cake":

&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2001/09/onions-bitter-tears-of-irony/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2001/09/onions-bitter-tears-of-irony/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt; continues to be America's leading ha-ha-only-serious forum, serving, somehow, as both escape valve and flame-fanner for the nation's bitterest ailments. For years, they've run their "‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens" headline after every major mass shooting:

&lt;a href="https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1819576527"&gt;https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1819576527&lt;/a&gt;

But as America continues to record multiple, daily, mass shootings, &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt;'s writers needed something else. Yesterday, they ran "Americans Describe What It’s Like Surviving A Mass Shooting," and oh shit is it a doozy:

&lt;a href="https://www.theonion.com/surviving-a-mass-shooting-americans-describe-what-it-s-1850438794"&gt;https://www.theonion.com/surviving-a-mass-shooting-americans-describe-what-it-s-1850438794&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  “It makes you really appreciate how free we are as a country when you’re hiding under a desk with bullets flying over your head.”
  
  “Those 15 minutes standing a safe distance away from the school while the suspect finished shooting were the most harrowing of my life.” (picture of a cop)
  
  “There’s nothing like a brush with death to remind you that all your previously held beliefs are correct and should not be questioned.” (Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA))
  
  “My boss let me use one of my three unpaid sick days to get sewed up.”
  
  “Only two of my three kids came home from school, but Texas has no property taxes, so it’s a wash.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I mean.

Shit.

The new Gilded American Age is already looking a little tarnished. The unholy alliance between the infinite greed of the capital classes and the sadistic indifference of the terrified, authoritarian, musket-fucking Bible-bashers has us racing for the precipice.

It's wild to see the parties fiddle while the Shining City on the Hill burns. I think we all expect it of the Republicans, but watching the Democrats fail working people and continue to climb into bed with the ultra-wealthy and their priorities is demoralizing, especially for those of us hoping for more from the party of the New Deal.

There's been a lot of ink spilled on the Trump transformation of the GOP, but Dems' transformation from a party representing labor to a party representing McKinsey consultants is less well understood.

A new book, &lt;em&gt;Left Behind: The Democrats’ Failed Attempt to Solve Inequality,&lt;/em&gt; by Lily Geismer, tells that story:

&lt;a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/lily-geismer/left-behind/9781541757004/"&gt;https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/lily-geismer/left-behind/9781541757004/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; gets a fascinating review by Ruby Ray Daily in &lt;em&gt;Public Books&lt;/em&gt;, where it is contrasted with &lt;em&gt;Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s&lt;/em&gt; by Nicole Hemmer:

&lt;a href="https://www.publicbooks.org/what-the-1990s-did-to-america/"&gt;https://www.publicbooks.org/what-the-1990s-did-to-america/&lt;/a&gt;

Both books grapple with way that the end of the Cold War and the Reagan era transformed both major US parties. In Hemmer's telling, Reagan wasn't the "dawn of the free-market conservative," but rather, the "late summer" of that brand of conservativism. Without "anticommunism" to animate it, the Reagan Right coalition thrashed in a void, eventually gelling into today's "nativism, racial resentment, and media hysteria."

Meanwhile, the Dems under Clinton turned their backs on state-backed programs and towards market-based initiatives, making today's "lopsided, unfair economic gains" inevitable. The Atari Democrats of the Clinton years were - in the words of one bitter union organizer - "crypto-Republicans."

Clinton isn't the Democrats' Eisenhower ("accommodating his party to, and sanding the radical edges off, a new consensus"). He's the Democrats' Reagan, "shaping and even leading this new market-oriented consensus."

For Geismer, Clinton wasn't simply jettisoning the New Deal - rather, he was embracing its technocratic, expertise-worshiping aspect. It was this tendency that produced Clinton's ghastly "welfare reform" and other attacks on working people. It's a stark reminder that ideology without a moral center sows the seeds of its own ruin.

Meanwhile, we live today in the Atari Democrats' world, where wealthy professionals play a high-speed game of musical chairs for the few remaining opportunities to survive the coming polycrisis with intact shelter, food and comfort. One way this plays out is in the surreal, vicious fights over college admissions.

It's only been a minute since the Varsity Blues scandal erupted: wealthy parents (including some celebrities) bribed college officials to pretend that nepobabies and failsons were elite athletes, letting them ooze into top college slots reserved for sports prodigies (slots that often represent the only chance for poor teens of color to enter these universities):

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Blues_scandal"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Blues_scandal&lt;/a&gt;

The scandal touched a nerve, perhaps because it punctured the already-fragile bubble of pretense that  top colleges were full of the smartest kids in America - rather than, say, the kids whose parents attended those institutions ("legacies"), or made giant donations, or were coached and polished by tutors and consultants.

Well, there's never just one ant. Varsity Blues wasn't the only way for rich, status-obsessed parents to buy their kids' way into college. The latest rot exposed is a doozy of a scam: parents pay academics to pretend to collaborate with high-schoolers so they can put their names on papers published in peer-reviewed journals:

&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/college-high-school-research-peer-review-publications"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/college-high-school-research-peer-review-publications&lt;/a&gt;

The story was broken last week by Dan Golden and Kunal Purhorit for &lt;em&gt;Propublica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;, in a long-read that details all the variations on this scam. For example, sometimes the kid does actually do some original research, but the "journal" is a fake outlet run by the "service" that connects academics and kids.

Bottom line is it works: college admissions officers are deluged with applications and don't have time to look up the "peer reviewed" publications claimed by applicants. Faculty don't have the time or inclination to do it either. The stakes are incredibly high, the costs are very high, and the institutions that do the evaluations are weak afterthoughts.

I wonder if we won't just eventually give up and admit that a degree from a Big Ten or an Ivy is just a thing you buy, like a Picasso or a blood diamond. We could just turn it into a half million dollar blue tick and have done with it.

Anyway.

Hate to end this linkdump on a down-note, but there you have it. Next time I do one of these, I'll try to remember to hold back one of the upbeat links for a palate cleanser.

&lt;h1&gt;Why they're smearing Lina Khan (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/14/making-good-trouble/#the-peoples-champion"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

My god, they sure &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; Lina Khan. This once-in-a-generation, groundbreaking, brilliant legal scholar and fighter for the public interest, the slayer of Reaganomics, has attracted more vitriol, mockery, and dismissal than any of her predecessors in living memory.

She sure must be doing something right, huh?

A quick refresher. In 2017, Khan - then a law student - published &lt;em&gt;Amazon's Antitrust Paradox&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Yale Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;. It was a brilliant, blistering analysis showing how the Reagan-era theory of antitrust (which celebrates monopolies as "efficient") had failed on its own terms, using Amazon as Exhibit A of the ways in which post-Reagan antitrust had left Americans vulnerable to corporate abuse:

&lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox&lt;/a&gt;

The paper sent seismic shocks through both legal and economic circles, and goosed the neo-Brandeisian movement (sneeringly dismissed as "hipster antitrust"). This movement is a rebuke to Reaganomics, with its celebration of monopolies, trickle-down, offshoring, corporate dark money, revolving-door regulatory capture, and companies that are simultaneously too big to fail and too big to jail.

This movement has many proponents, of course - not just Khan - but Khan's careful scholarship, combined with her encyclopedic knowledge of the long-dormant statutory powers that federal agencies had to make change, and a strategy for reviving those powers to protect Americans from corporate predators made her a powerful, inspirational figure.

When Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, he surprised everyone by appointing Khan to the FTC. It wasn't just that she had such a radical vision - it was also that she lacked the usual corporate law experience that such an appointee would normally require (experience that would ensure that the FTC was helmed by people whose default view of the world is that it should be structured and regulated by powerful, wealthy people in corporate boardrooms).

Even more surprising was that Khan was made &lt;em&gt;chair&lt;/em&gt; of the FTC, something that was only possible because a few Republican Senators broke with their party to support her candidacy:

&lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1171/vote_117_1_00233.htm"&gt;https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1171/vote_117_1_00233.htm&lt;/a&gt;

These Republicans saw in Khan an ally in their fight against "woke" Big Tech. For these senators, the problem wasn't that tech had got too big and powerful - it was that there were a few limited instances in which tech leaders failed to wield that power in the ways they preferred.

The Republican project is a matter of getting turkeys to vote for Christmas by doing a lot of culture war bullshit, cruelly abusing disfavored sexual and racial minorities. This wins support from low-information voters who'll vote against their class interests and support more monopolies, more tax cuts for the rich, and more cuts to the services they rely on.

But while tech leaders are 100% committed to the project of permanent oligarchic takeover of every sphere of American life, they are less full-throated in their support for hateful, cruel discrimination against disfavored minorities (in this regard, tech leaders resemble the corporate wing of the Democrats, which is where we get the "Silicon Valley is a Democratic Party stronghold" narrative).

This failure to unquestioningly and unstintingly back culture war bullshit put tech leaders in the GOP's crosshairs. Some GOP politicians actually believe in the culture war bullshit, and are grossly offended that tech is "woke." Others are smart enough not to get high on their own supply, but worry that any tech obstruction in the bullshit culture wars will make it harder to get sufficient turkey votes for a big fat Christmas surprise.

Biden's ceding of antitrust policy to the left wing of the party, combined with disaffected GOP senators viewing Khan as their enemy's enemy, led to Khan's historic appointment as FTC Chair. In that position, she was joined by a slate of Biden trustbusters, including Jonathan Kanter at the DoJ Antitrust Division, Tim Wu at the White House, and other important, skilled and principled fighters like Alvaro Bedoya (FTC), Rebecca Slaughter (FTC), Rohit Chopra (CFPB), and many others.

Crucially, these new appointees weren't just principled, they were &lt;em&gt;good at their jobs&lt;/em&gt;. In 2021, Tim Wu wrote an executive order for Biden that laid out 72 concrete ways in which the administration could act - with no further Congressional authorization - to blunt corporate power and insulate the American people from oligarchs' abusive and extractive practices:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down&lt;/a&gt;

Since then, the antitrust arm of the Biden administration have been &lt;em&gt;fuckin' ninjas&lt;/em&gt;, Getting Shit Done in ways large and small, working - for the first time since Reagan - to protect Americans from predatory businesses:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/18/administrative-competence/#i-know-stuff"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/18/administrative-competence/#i-know-stuff&lt;/a&gt;

This is in marked contrast to the corporate Dems' champions in the administration. People like Pete Buttigieg are heralded as competent
technocrats, "realists" who are too principled to peddle hopium to the base, writing checks they can't cash. All this is cover for a King Log performance, in which Buttigieg's far-reaching regulatory authority sits unused on a shelf while a million Americans are stranded over Christmas and whole towns are endangered by greedy, reckless rail barons straight out of the Gilded Age:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge&lt;/a&gt;

The contrast between the Biden trustbusters and their counterparts from the corporate wing is stark. While the corporate wing insists that every pitch is out of the zone, Khan and her allies are swinging for the stands. They're trying to make life better for you and me, by declaring commercial surveillance to be an unfair business practice and thus illegal:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/12/regulatory-uncapture/#conscious-uncoupling"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/12/regulatory-uncapture/#conscious-uncoupling&lt;/a&gt;

And by declaring noncompete "agreements" that shackle good workers to shitty jobs to be illegal:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#neofeudal"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#neofeudal&lt;/a&gt;

And naturally, this has &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; pissed off all the right people: America's billionaires and their cheerleaders in the press, government, and the hive of scum and villainy that is the Big Law/thinktank industrial-complex.

Take the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;: since Khan took office, they have published &lt;em&gt;67 vicious editorials&lt;/em&gt; attacking her and her policies. Khan is living rent-free in Rupert Murdoch's head. Not only that, he's given her the presidential suite! You &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to see it.

These attacks are worth reading, if only to see how flimsy and frivolous they are. One major subgenre is that Khan shouldn't be bringing any action against Amazon, because her groundbreaking scholarship about the company means she has a conflict of interest. Holy &lt;em&gt;moly&lt;/em&gt; is this a stupid thing to say. The idea that the chair of an expert agency should recuse herself &lt;em&gt;because she is an expert&lt;/em&gt; is what the physicists call &lt;em&gt;not even wrong.&lt;/em&gt;

But these attacks are even more laughable due to who they're coming from: people who have the most outrageous conflicts of interest imaginable, and who were conspicuously silent for years as the FTC's revolving door admitted a bestiary of swamp-creatures so conflicted it's a wonder they managed to dress themselves in the morning.

Writing in &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, David Dayen runs the numbers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Since the late 1990s, 31 out of 41 top FTC officials worked directly for a company that has business before the agency, with 26 of them related to the technology industry.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-06-23-attacks-lina-khans-ethics-reveal-projection/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/2023-06-23-attacks-lina-khans-ethics-reveal-projection/&lt;/a&gt;

Take Christine Wilson, a GOP-appointed FTC Commissioner who quit the agency in a huff because Khan wanted to do things for the American people, and not their self-appointed oligarchic princelings. Wilson wrote an angry break-up letter to Khan that the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; published, presaging their concierge service for Samuel Alito:

&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-im-resigning-from-the-ftc-commissioner-ftc-lina-khan-regulation-rule-violation-antitrust-339f115d"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-im-resigning-from-the-ftc-commissioner-ftc-lina-khan-regulation-rule-violation-antitrust-339f115d&lt;/a&gt;

For Wilson to question Khan's ethics took galactic-scale chutzpah. Wilson, after all, is a commissioner who took cash money from Bristol-Myers Squibb, then voted to approve their merger with Celgene:

&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4365601-Wilson-Christine-Smith-final278.html"&gt;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4365601-Wilson-Christine-Smith-final278.html&lt;/a&gt;

Or take Wilson's GOP FTC predecessor Josh Wright, whose incestuous relationship with the companies he oversaw at the Commission are so intimate he's practically got a Habsburg jaw. Wright went from Google to the US government and back again &lt;em&gt;four times&lt;/em&gt;. He also lobbied the FTC on behalf of Qualcomm (a major donor to Wright's employer, George Mason’s Antonin Scalia Law School) after working "personally and substantially" while serving at the FTC.

George Mason's Scalia center practically &lt;em&gt;owns&lt;/em&gt; the revolving door, counting &lt;em&gt;fourteen&lt;/em&gt; FTC officials among its affliates:

&lt;a href="https://campaignforaccountability.org/ttp-investigation-big-techs-backdoor-to-the-ftc/"&gt;https://campaignforaccountability.org/ttp-investigation-big-techs-backdoor-to-the-ftc/&lt;/a&gt;

Since the 1990s, 31 out of 41 top FTC officials - both GOP appointed and appointees backed by corporate Dems - "worked directly for a company that has business before the agency":

&lt;a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/ftc-big-tech-revolving-door-problem-report/"&gt;https://www.citizen.org/article/ftc-big-tech-revolving-door-problem-report/&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; of FTC and DoJ antitrust lawyers who served between 2014-21 left government service and went straight to work for a Big Law firm, serving the companies they'd regulated just a few months before:

&lt;a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Revolving-Door-In-Federal-Antitrust-Enforcement.pdf"&gt;https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Revolving-Door-In-Federal-Antitrust-Enforcement.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

Take Deborah Feinstein, formerly the head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, now a partner at Arnold &amp;amp; Porter, where she's represented General Electric, NBCUniversal, Unilever, and Pepsi and a whole medicine chest's worth of pharma giants before her former subordinates at the FTC. Michael Moiseyev who was assistant manager of FTC Competition is now in charge of mergers at Weil Gotshal &amp;amp; Manges, working for Microsoft, Meta, and Eli Lilly.

There's a whole bunch more, but Dayen reserves special notice for Andrew Smith, Trump's FTC Consumer Protection boss. Before he was put on the public payroll, Smith represented &lt;em&gt;120 clients&lt;/em&gt; that had business before the Commission, including "nearly every major bank in America, drug industry lobbyist PhRMA, Uber, Equifax, Amazon, Facebook, Verizon, and a variety of payday lenders":

Before Khan, in other words, the FTC was a "conflict-of-interest assembly line, moving through corporate lawyers and industry hangers-on without resistance for decades."

Khan is the first FTC head with no conflicts. This leaves her opponents in the sweaty, desperate position of inventing conflicts out of thin air.

For these corporate lickspittles, Khan's "conflict" is that she has a &lt;em&gt;point of view&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, she thinks that the FTC should do its job.

This makes grifters like Jim Jordan furious. Yesterday, Jordan grilled Khan in a hearing where he accused her of violating an ethics official's advice that she should recuse herself from Big Tech cases. This is a talking point that was created and promoted by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;:

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-16/ftc-rejected-ethics-advice-for-khan-recusal-on-meta-case"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-16/ftc-rejected-ethics-advice-for-khan-recusal-on-meta-case&lt;/a&gt;

That ethics official, Lorielle Pankey, did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, in fact, make this recommendation. It's simply untrue (she &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; say that Khan presiding over cases that she has made public statements about could be used as ammo against her, but did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; say that it violated any ethical standard).

But there's more to this story. Pankey herself has a &lt;em&gt;gigantic&lt;/em&gt; conflict of interest in this case, including a stock portfolio with between $15,001 and $50,000 in Meta stock (Meta is another company that has whined in print and in its briefs that it is a poor defenseless lamb being picked on by big, mean ole Lina Khan):

&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ethics-official-owned-meta-stock-while-recommending-ftc-chair-recuse-herself-from-meta-case-8582a83b"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ethics-official-owned-meta-stock-while-recommending-ftc-chair-recuse-herself-from-meta-case-8582a83b&lt;/a&gt;

Jordan called his hearing on the back of this fake scandal, and then proceeded to show his whole damned ass, even as his GOP colleagues got into a substantive and even informative dialog with Khan:

&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/power/2023-07-14-jim-jordan-misfires-attacks-lina-khan/"&gt;https://prospect.org/power/2023-07-14-jim-jordan-misfires-attacks-lina-khan/&lt;/a&gt;

Mostly what came out of that hearing was news about how Khan is doing her job, working on behalf of the American people. For example, she confirmed that she's investigating OpenAI for nonconsensually harvesting a mountain of Americans' personal information:

&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8ce04d67-069b-4c9d-91bf-11649f5adc74"&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/8ce04d67-069b-4c9d-91bf-11649f5adc74&lt;/a&gt;

Other Republicans, including confirmed swamp creatures like Matt Gaetz, ended up agreeing with Khan that Amazon Ring is a privacy dumpster-fire. Nobodies like Rep Tom Massie gave Khan an opening to discuss how her agency is protecting mom-and-pop grocers from giant, price-gouging, greedflation-drunk national chains. Jeff Van Drew gave her a chance to talk about the FTC's war on robocalls. Lance Gooden let her talk about her fight against horse doping.

But Khan's opponents did manage to repeat a lot of the smears against her, and not just the bogus conflict-of-interest story. They also accused her of being 0-4 in her actions to block mergers, ignoring the &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; number of mergers that have been called off or not initiated &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; M&amp;amp;A professionals now understand they can no longer expect these mergers to be waved through. Indeed, just last night I spoke with a friend who owns a medium-sized tech company that Meta tried to buy out, only to withdraw from the deal because their lawyers told them it would get challenged at the FTC, with an uncertain outcome.

These talking points got picked up by people commenting on Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley's ruling against the FTC in the Microsoft-Activision merger. The FTC was seeking an injunction against the merger, and Corley turned them down flat. The ruling was objectively &lt;em&gt;very bad&lt;/em&gt;. Start with the fact that Corley's son is a Microsoft employee who stands reap massive gains in his stock options if the merger goes through.

But beyond this (real, non-imaginary, not manufactured conflict of interest), Corley's judgment and her remarks in court were &lt;em&gt;inexcusably&lt;/em&gt; bad, as Matt Stoller writes:

&lt;a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/judge-rules-for-microsoft-mergers"&gt;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/judge-rules-for-microsoft-mergers&lt;/a&gt;

In her ruling, Corley explained that she didn't think Microsoft would abuse the market dominance they'd gain by merging their giant videogame platform and studio with one of its largest competitors. Why not? Because Microsoft's execs pinky-swore that they wouldn't abuse that power.

Corely's deference to Microsoft's corporate priorities goes deeper than trusting its execs, though. In denying the FTC's motion, she stated that it would be unfair to put the merger on hold in order to have a full investigation into its competition implications because Microsoft and Activision had set a deadline of July 18 to conclude things, and Microsoft would have to pay a penalty if that deadline passed.

This is surreal: a judge ruled that a corporation's radical, massive merger shouldn't be subject to full investigation because that corporation itself set an arbitrary deadline to conclude the deal before such an investigation could be concluded. That's pretty convenient for future mega-mergers - just set a short deadline and Judge Corely will tell regulators that the merger can't be investigated because the deadline is looming.

And this is all about the future. As Stoller writes, Microsoft isn't exactly subtle about why it wants this merger. Its own execs said that the reason they were spending "dump trucks" of money buying games studios was to "spend Sony out of business."

Now, maybe you hate Sony. Maybe you hate Activision. There's plenty of good reason to hate both - they're run by creeps who do shitty things to gamers and to their employees. But if you think that &lt;em&gt;Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; will be better once it eliminates its competition, then you have the attention span of a goldfish on Adderall.

Microsoft made &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same promises it made on Activision when it bought out another games studio, Zenimax - and it broke every one of those promises.

Microsoft has a long, long, &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; history of being a brutal, abusive monopolist. It is a &lt;em&gt;convicted&lt;/em&gt; monopolist. And its bad conduct didn't end with the browser wars. You remember how the lockdown turned all our homes into rent-free branch offices for our employers? Microsoft seized on that moment to offer our bosses keystroke-and-click level surveillance of our use of our own computers in our own homes, via its Office365 bossware product:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge&lt;/a&gt;

If you think a company that gave your boss a tool to spy on their employees and rank them by "productivity" as a prelude to firing them or cutting their pay is going to treat gamers or game makers well once they have "spent the competition out of business," you're a credulous sucker and you are gonna be &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; disappointed.

The enshittification play is obvious: use investor cash to make things temporarily nice for customers and suppliers, lock both of them in - in this case, it's with a subscription-based service similar to Netflix's - and then claw all that value back until all that's left is a big pile of shit.

The Microsoft case is about the future. Judge Corely doesn't take the future seriously: as she said during the trial, "All of this is for a shooter videogame." The reason Corely greenlit this merger isn't because it won't be harmful - it's because she doesn't think those harms matter.

But it does, and not just because games are an art form that generate billions of dollars, employ a vast workforce, and bring pleasure to millions. It also matters because this is yet another one of the Reaganomic precedents that tacitly endorses monopolies as efficient forces for good. As Stoller writes, Corley's ruling means that "deal bankers are sharpening pencils and saying ‘Great, the government lost! We can get mergers through everywhere else.’ Basically, if you like your high medical prices, you should be cheering on Microsoft’s win today."

Ronald Reagan's antitrust has colonized our brains so thoroughly that commentators were surprised when, immediately after the ruling, the FTC filed an appeal. &lt;em&gt;Don't they know they've lost?&lt;/em&gt; the commentators said:

&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ftc-files-appeal-of-microsoft-activision-deal-ruling-1850640159"&gt;https://gizmodo.com/ftc-files-appeal-of-microsoft-activision-deal-ruling-1850640159&lt;/a&gt;

They echoed the smug words of insufferable Activision boss Mike Ybarra: "Your tax dollars at work."

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1679277251337277440"&gt;https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1679277251337277440&lt;/a&gt;

But &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; Khan is appealing. The only reason that's surprising is that Khan is working for us, the American people, not the giant corporations the FTC is supposed to be defending us from. Sure, I get that this is a major change! But she needs our backing, not our cheap cynicism.

The business lobby and their pathetic Renfields have hoarded all the nice things and they don't want us to have any. Khan and her trustbuster colleagues want the opposite. There is no measure so small that the corporate world won't have a conniption over it. Take click to cancel, the FTC's perfectly reasonable proposal that if you sign up for a recurring payment subscription with a single click, you should be able to cancel it with a single click.

The tooth-gnashing and garment-rending and scenery-chewing over this is &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;. America's biggest companies have wheeled out their biggest guns, claiming that if they make it too easy to unsubscribe, they will lose money. In other words, they are &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; making money not because people want their products, but because it's too hard to stop paying for them!

&lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/12/ftc_cancel_subscriptions/"&gt;https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/12/ftc_cancel_subscriptions/&lt;/a&gt;

We shouldn't have to tolerate this sleaze. And if we back Khan and her team, they'll protect us from these scams. Don't let them convince you to give up hope. This is the start of the fight, not the end. We're trying to reverse 40 years' worth of Reagonmics here. It won't happen overnight. There will be setbacks. But keep your eyes on the prize - this is the most exciting moment for countering corporate power and giving it back to the people in my lifetime. We owe it to ourselves, our kids and our planet to fight one.

&lt;h1&gt;Denazification, truth and reconciliation, and the story of Germany's story (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/19/stolpersteine/#truth-and-reconciliation"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

Germany is the "world champion in remembrance," celebrated for its post-Holocaust policies of ensuring that every German never forgot what had been done in their names, and in holding themselves and future generations accountable for the Nazis' crimes.

All my life, the Germans have been a counterexample to other nations, where the order of the day was to officially forget the sins that stained the land. "Least said, soonest mended," was the Canadian and American approach to the genocide of First Nations people and the theft of their land. It was, famously, how America, especially the American south, dealt with the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.

Silence begets forgetting, which begets revisionism. The founding crimes of our nations receded into the mists of time and acquired a gauzy, romantic veneer. Plantations - slave labor camps where work was obtained through torture, maiming and murder - were recast as the tragiromantic settings of &lt;em&gt;Gone With the Wind&lt;/em&gt;. The deliberate extinction of indigenous peoples was revised as the "taming of the New World." The American Civil War was retold as "The Lost Cause," fought over states' rights, not over the right of the ultra-wealthy to terrorize kidnapped Africans and their descendants into working to death.

This wasn't how they did it in Germany. Nazi symbols and historical revisionism were banned (even the Berlin production of "The Producers" had to be performed without swastikas). The criminals were tried and executed. Every student learned what had been done. Cash reparations were paid - to Jews, and to the people whom the Nazis had conquered and brutalized. Having given in to ghastly barbarism on a terrifyingly industrial scale, the Germans had remade themselves with characteristic efficiency, rooting out the fascist rot and ensuring that it never took hold again.

But Germany's storied reformation was always oversold. As neo-Nazi movements sprang up and organized political parties - like the far-right Alternative für Deutschland - fielded fascist candidates, they also took to the streets in violent mobs. Worse, top German security officials turned out to be allied with AfD:

&lt;a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/08/04/germ-a04.html"&gt;https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/08/04/germ-a04.html&lt;/a&gt;

Neofascists in Germany had fat bankrolls, thanks to generous, secret donations from some of the country's wealthiest billionaires:

&lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/billionaire-backing-may-have-helped-launch-afd-a-1241029.html"&gt;https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/billionaire-backing-may-have-helped-launch-afd-a-1241029.html&lt;/a&gt;

And they broadened their reach by marrying their existing conspiratorial beliefs with Qanon, which made their numbers surge:

&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-fringe-groups-are-using-qanon-to-amplify-their-wild-messages"&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-fringe-groups-are-using-qanon-to-amplify-their-wild-messages&lt;/a&gt;

Today, the far right is surging around Europe, with the rot spreading from Hungary and Poland to Italy and France. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Jacobin&lt;/em&gt;'s David Broder, Tommaso Speccher, a researcher based in Berlin, explores the failure of Germany's storied memory:

&lt;a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/07/germany-nazism-holocaust-federal-republic-memory-culture/"&gt;https://jacobin.com/2023/07/germany-nazism-holocaust-federal-republic-memory-culture/&lt;/a&gt;

Speccher is at pains to remind us that Germany's truth and reconciliation proceeded in fits and starts, and involved compromises that were seldom discussed, even though they left some of the Reich's most vicious criminals untouched by any accountability for their crimes, and denied some victims any justice - or even an apology.

You may know that many queer people who were sent to Nazi concentration camps were immediately re-imprisoned after the camps were liberated. Both Nazi Germany and post-Nazi Germany made homosexuality a crime:

&lt;a href="https://time.com/5953047/lgbtq-holocaust-stories/"&gt;https://time.com/5953047/lgbtq-holocaust-stories/&lt;/a&gt;

But while there's been some recent historical grappling with this jaw-dropping injustice, there's been far less attention given to the plight of the communists, labor organizers, social democrats and other leftists whom the Nazis imprisoned and murdered. These political prisoners (and their survivors) struggled mightily to get the reparations they were due.

Not only was the process punitively complex, but it was administered by bureaucrats who had served in the Reich - the people who had sent them to the camps were in charge of deciding whether they were due compensation.

This is part of a wider pattern. The business-leaders who abetted the Reich through their firms - Siemens, BMW, Hugo Boss, IG Farben, Volkswagon - were largely spared any punishment for their role in the the Holocaust. Many got to keep the riches they acquired through their part in an act of genocide.

Meanwhile, historians grappling with the war through the "Historikerstreit" drew invidious comparisons between communism and fascism, equating the two ideologies and tacitly excusing the torture and killing of political prisoners (this tale is still told today - in America! My kid's AP history course made this exact point last year).

The refusal to consider that extreme wealth, inequality, and the lust for profits - not blood - provided the Nazis with the budget, materiel and backing they needed to seize control in Germany is of a piece with the decision not to hold Germany's Nazi-enabling plutocrats to account.

The impunity for business leaders who collaborated with the Nazis in exploiting slave labor is hard to believe. Take IG Farben, a company still doing a merry business today. Farben ran a rubber factory on Auschwitz slave labor, but its executives were frustrated by the delays occasioned by the daily 4.5m forced march from the death-camp to its factory:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/02/plunderers/#farben"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/02/plunderers/#farben&lt;/a&gt;

So Farben built Monowitz, its own, private-sector concentration camp. IG Farben purchased 25,000 slaves from the Reich, among them as many children as possible (the Reich charged less for child slaves).

Even by the standards of Nazi death camps, Monowitz was a charnel house. Monowitz's inmates were worked to death in just &lt;em&gt;three months&lt;/em&gt;. The conditions were so brutal that &lt;em&gt;the SS guards sent official complaints to Berlin&lt;/em&gt;. Among their complaints: Farben refused to fund extra hospital beds for the slaves who were beaten so badly they required immediate medical attention.

Farben broke the historical orthodoxy about slavery: until Monowitz, historians widely believed that enslavers would - at the very least - seek to maintain the health of their slaves, simply as a matter of economic efficiency. But the Reich's rock-bottom rates for fresh slaves liberated Farben from the need to preserve their slaves' ability to work. Instead, the slaves of Monowitz became disposable, and the bloodless logic of profit maximization dictated that more work could be attained at lower prices by working them to death over twelve short weeks.

Few of us know about Monowitz today, but in the last years of the war, it shocked the world. Joseph Borkin - a US antitrust lawyer who was sent to Germany after the war as part of the legal team overseeing the denazification program - wrote a seminal history of IG Farben, "The Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben":

&lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/517797736/The-Crime-and-Punishment-of-I-G-Farben"&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/517797736/The-Crime-and-Punishment-of-I-G-Farben&lt;/a&gt;

Borkin's book was a bestseller, which enraged America's business lobby. The book made the connection between Farben's commercial strategies and the rise of the Reich (Farben helped manipulate global commodity prices in the runup to the war, which let the Reich fund its war preparations). He argued that big business constituted a danger to democracy and human rights, because its leaders would always sideline both in service to profits.

US companies like Standard Oil and Dow Chemicals poured resources into discrediting the book and smearing Borkin, forcing him into retirement and obscurity in 1945, the same year his publisher withdrew his book from stores.

When we speak of Germany's denazification effort, it's as a German program, but of course that's not right. Denazification was initiated, designed and overseen by the war's winners - in West Germany, that was the USA.

Those US prosecutors and bureaucrats wanted justice, but not &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; of it. For them, denazification had to be balanced against anticommunism, and the imperatives of American business. Nazi war criminals must go on trial - but not if they were rocket scientists, especially not if the USSR might make use of them:

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun&lt;/a&gt;

Recall that in the USA, the bizarre epithet "premature antifascist" was used to condemn Americans who opposed Nazism (and fascism elsewhere in Europe) too &lt;em&gt;soon&lt;/em&gt;, because these antifascists opposed the authoritarian politics of big business in America, too:

&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jul-15-bk-22387-story.html"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jul-15-bk-22387-story.html&lt;/a&gt;

When 24 Farben executives were tried at Nuremberg for the slaughter at Monowitz, then argued that they had no choice but to pursue slave labor - it was their duty to their shareholders. The judges agreed: 19 of those executives walked.

Anticommunism hamstrung denazification. There was no question that German elites and its largest businesses were complicit in Nazi crimes - not mere suppliers, but active collaborators. Antifacism wasn't formally integrated into the denazification framework until the 1980s with "constitutional patriotism," which took until the 1990s to take firm root.

The requirement for a denazification program that didn't condemn capitalism meant that there would always be holes in Germany's truth and reconciliation process. The newly formed Federal Republic set aside Article 10 of the Nuremberg Charter, which would hold all members of the Nazi Party and SS responsible for their crimes. Article 10 didn't survive contact with the Federal Republic: immediately upon taking office, Konrad Adenauer suspended Article 10, sparing 10 million war criminals.

While those spared included many rank-and-file order-followers, it also included many of the Reich's most notorious criminals. The Nazi judge who sent Erika von Brockdorff to her death for her leftist politics was given a judge's pension after the war, and lived out his days in a luxurious mansion.

Not every Nazi was pensioned off - many continued to serve in the post-war West German government. Even as Willy Brandt was demonstrating historic remorse for Germany's crimes, his foreign ministry was riddled with ex-Nazi bureaucrats who'd served in Hitler's foreign ministry. We still remember Brandt's brilliant 1973 UN speech on the Holocaust:

&lt;a href="https://www.willy-brandt-biography.com/historical-sources/videos/speech-uno-new-york-1973/"&gt;https://www.willy-brandt-biography.com/historical-sources/videos/speech-uno-new-york-1973/&lt;/a&gt;

But recollections of Brandt's speech are seldom accompanied by historian Götz Aly's observation that Brandt couldn't have given that speech in Germany without serious blowback from the country's still numerous and emboldened antisemites (Brandt donated his Nobel prize money to restore Venice's Scuola Grande Tedesca synagogue, but ensured that this was kept secret until after his death).

All this to say that Germany's reputation as "world champions of memory" is based on acts undertaken decades after the war. Some of Germany's best-known Holocaust memorials are very recent, like the Wannsee Conference House (1992), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe (2005), and the Topography of Terror Museum in (2010).

Germany's remembering includes an explicit act of forgetting - forgetting the role Germany's business leaders and elites played in Hitler's rise to power and the Nazi crimes that followed. For Speccher, the rise of neofacist movements in Germany can't be separated from this selective memory, weighed down by anticommunist fervor.

And in East Germany, there was a different kind of incomplete rememberance. While the DDR's historians and teachings emphasized the role of business in the rise of fascism, they excluded all the elements of Nazism rooted in bigotry: antisemitism, homophobia, sectarianism, and racism. For East German historians, Nazism wasn't about these, it was solely "the ultimate end point of the history of capitalism."

Neither is sufficient to prevent authoritarianism and repression, obviously. But the DDR is dust, and the anticommunism-tainted version of denazification is triumphant. Today, Europe's wealthiest families and largest businesses are funneling vast sums into far-right "populist" parties that trade in antisemitic "Great Replacement" tropes and Holocaust denial:

&lt;a href="https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/Europe%E2%80%99s%20two-faced%20authoritarian%20right%20FINAL_1.pdf"&gt;https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/Europe%E2%80%99s%20two-faced%20authoritarian%20right%20FINAL_1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

And Germany's coddled aristocratic families and their wealthy benefactors - whose Nazi ties were quietly forgiven after the war - conspire to overthrow the government and install a far-right autocracy:

&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/25-suspected-members-german-far-right-group-arrested-raids-prosecutors-office-2022-12-07/"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/25-suspected-members-german-far-right-group-arrested-raids-prosecutors-office-2022-12-07/&lt;/a&gt;

In recent years, I've spent a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time thinking about denazification. For all the flaws in Germany's remembrance, it stands apart as one of the brightest lights in national reckonings with unforgivable crimes. Compare this with, say, Spain, where the remains of fascist dictator Francisco Franco were housed in a hero's monument, amidst his victims' bones, until &lt;em&gt;2019&lt;/em&gt;:

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S%C3%A1nchez#Domestic_policy"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S%C3%A1nchez#Domestic_policy&lt;/a&gt;

What do you do with the losers of a just war? "Least said soonest mended" was never a plausible answer, and has been a historical failure - as the fields of fluttering Confederate flags across the American south can attest (to say nothing of the failure of American de-ba'athification in Iraq):

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba%27athification"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba%27athification&lt;/a&gt;

But on the other hand, people who lose the war aren't going to dig a hole, climb in and pull the dirt down on top of themselves. Just because I think Germany's denazification was hobbled by the decision to let its architects and perpetrators walk free, I don't know that I would have supported prison for all ten &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; people captured by Article 10.

And it's not clear that an explicit antifascism from the start would have patched the holes in German denazification. As Speccher points out, Italy's postwar constitution was explicitly antifascist, the nation "steeped in institutional anti-fascism." Postwar Italian governments included prominent resistance fighters who'd fought Mussolini and his brownshirts.

But in the 1990s, "the end of the First Republic" saw constitutional reforms that removed antifascism - reforms that preceded the rise of the corrupt authoritarian Silvio Berlusconi - and there's a line from him to the neofascists in today's ruling Italian coalition.

Is there &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; hope for creating a durable, democratic, anti-authoritarian state out of a world run by the descendants of plunderers and killers? Can &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; revolution - political, military or technological - hope to reckon with (let alone make peace with!) the people who have brought us to this terrifying juncture?

&lt;img alt="The Tor Books cover for 'The Lost Cause,' designed by Will Staehle, featuring the head of the snake on the Gadsen 'Don't Tread on Me' flag, shedding a tear." src="https://craphound.com/images/9781250865939.jpg"/&gt;

Like I say, this is something I've spent a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time thinking about - not just how we might get out of this current mess, but how we'll &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; out of it. As is my wont, I've worked out my anxieties on the page. My next novel, &lt;em&gt;The Lost Cause&lt;/em&gt;, comes out from Tor Books and Head of Zeus in November:

&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Lost Cause&lt;/em&gt; is a post-GND utopian novel about a near-future world where the climate emergency is finally being treated with the seriousness and urgency it warrants. It's a world wracked by fire, flood, scorching heat, mass extinctions and rolling refugee crises - but it's also a world where we're &lt;em&gt;doing something about all this&lt;/em&gt;. It's not an optimistic book, but it is a &lt;em&gt;hopeful&lt;/em&gt; one. As Kim Stanley Robinson says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  This book looks like our future and feels like our present—it’s an unforgettable vision of what could be.  Even a partly good future will require wicked political battles and steadfast solidarity among those fighting for a better world, and here I lived it along with Brooks, Ana Lucía, Phuong, and their comrades in the struggle.  Along with the rush of adrenaline I felt a solid surge of hope.  May it go like this.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The Lost Cause&lt;/em&gt; is a hopeful book, but it's also a worried one. The book is set during a counter-reformation, where an unholy alliance of seagoing anarcho-capitalist wreckers and white nationalist militias are trying to seize power, snatching defeat from the jaws of the fragile climate victory. It's a book about the need for truth and reconciliation - and its limits.

As Bill McKibben says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The first great YIMBY novel, this chronicle of mutual aid is politically perceptive, scientifically sound, and extraordinarily hopeful even amidst the smoke. Forget the Silicon Valley bros--these are the California techsters we need rebuilding our world, one solar panel and prefab insulated wall at a time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We're currently in the midst of a decidedly unjust war - the war to continue roasting the planet, a war waged in the name of continuing enrichment of the world's already-obscenely-rich oligarchs. That war requires increasingly authoritarian measures, increasing violence and repression.

I believe we can win this war and secure a habitable planet for all of us - hell, I believe we can build a world of comfort and abundance out of its ashes, far better than this one:

&lt;a href="https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry/letters/metafoundry-75-resilience-abundance-decentralization"&gt;https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry/letters/metafoundry-75-resilience-abundance-decentralization&lt;/a&gt;

But even if that world comes to being, there will be millions of people who &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; it, a counter-revolution in waiting. These are our friends, our relatives, our neighbors. Figuring out how to make peace with them - and how to hold their most culpable, most powerful leaders to account - is a project that's as important, and gigantic, and uncertain, as a just transition is.

Private equity is &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; a racket. PE managers pile up other peoples' money - pension funds, plutes, other pools of money - and then "invest" it (buying businesses, loading them with debt, cutting wages, lowering quality and setting traps for customers). For this, they get an annual fee - 2% - of the money they manage, and a bonus for any profits they make.

On top of this, private equity bosses get to use the carried interest tax loophole, a scam that lets them treat this ordinary income as a capital gain, so they can pay half the taxes that a working stiff would pay on a regular salary. If you don't know much about carried interest, you might think it has to do with "interest" on a loan or a deposit, but it's &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; weirder. "Carried interest" is a tax regime designed for &lt;em&gt;16th century sea captains&lt;/em&gt; and their "interest" in the cargo they "carried":

Private equity is a cancer. Its profits come from buying productive firms, loading them with debt, abusing their suppliers, workers and customers, and driving them into ground, stiffing all of them - and the company's creditors. The mafia have a name for this. They call it a "bust out":

Private equity destroyed Toys R Us, Sears, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and many more companies beloved of Main Street, bled dry for Wall Street:

And they're coming for more. PE funds are "rolling up" thousands of Boomer-owned business as their owners retire. There's a good chance that every funeral home, pet groomer and urgent care clinic within an hour's drive of you is owned by a single PE firm. There's 2.9m more Boomer-owned businesses going up for sale in the coming years, with 32m employees, and PE is set to buy 'em all:

PE funds get their money from "institutional investors." It shouldn't surprise you to learn they treat their investors no better than their creditors, nor the customers, employees or suppliers of the businesses they buy.

Pension funds, in particular, are the perennial suckers at the poker table. My parent's pension fund, the Ontario Teachers' Fund, are every grifter's favorite patsy, losing $90m to Sam Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency scam:

&lt;a href="https://www.otpp.com/en-ca/about-us/news-and-insights/2022/ontario-teachers--statement-on-ftx/"&gt;https://www.otpp.com/en-ca/about-us/news-and-insights/2022/ontario-teachers--statement-on-ftx/&lt;/a&gt;

Pension funds are neck-deep in private equity, paying steep fees for shitty returns. Imagine knowing that the reason you can't afford your apartment anymore is your pension fund gambled with the private equity firm that bought your building and jacked up the rent - and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; lost money:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/25/pluralistic-your-daily-link-dose-25-feb-2020/"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/25/pluralistic-your-daily-link-dose-25-feb-2020/&lt;/a&gt;

But there's no depth too low for PE looters to sink to. They've found an exciting new way to steal from their investors, a scam called a "continuation fund." Writing in his latest newsletter, the great Matt Levine breaks it down:

&lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/matt-levines-money-stuff-buyout-funds-buy-from-themselves"&gt;https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/matt-levines-money-stuff-buyout-funds-buy-from-themselves&lt;/a&gt;

Here's the deal: say you're a PE guy who's raised a $1b fund. That entitles you to a 2% annual "carry" on the fund: $20,000,000/year. But you've managed to buy and asset strip so many productive businesses that it's now worth $5b. Your carry doesn't go up fivefold. You could sell the company and collect your 20% commission - $800m - but you stop collecting that annual carry.

But what if you do &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;? Here's how: you create a "continuation fund" - a fund that buys your old fund's portfolio. Now you've got $5b under management and your carry quintuples, to $100m/year. Levine dryly notes that the FT calls this "a controversial type of transaction":

&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11549c33-b97d-468b-8990-e6fd64294f85"&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/11549c33-b97d-468b-8990-e6fd64294f85&lt;/a&gt;

These deals "look like a pyramid scheme" - one fund flips its assets to another fund, with the same manager running both funds. It's a way to make the pie bigger, but to decrease the share (in both real and proportional terms) going to the pension funds and other institutional investors who backed the fund.

A PE boss is supposed to be a fiduciary, with a legal requirement to do what's best for their investors. But when the same PE manager is the buyer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the seller, and when the sale takes place without inviting any outside bidders, how can they possibly resolve their conflict of interest?

They can't: 42% of continuation fund deals involve a sale at a value lower than the one that the PE fund told their investors the assets were worth. Now, this may sound weird - if a PE boss wants to set a high initial value for their fund in order to maximize their carry, why would they sell its assets to the new fund at a discount?

Here's Levine's theory: if you're a PE guy going back to your investors for money to put in a new fund, you're more likely to succeed if you can show that they're getting a bargain. So you raise $1b, build it up to $5b, and then tell your investors they can buy the new fund for only $3b. Sure, they can get out - and lose big. Or they can take the deal, get the new fund at a 40% discount - and the PE boss gets $60m/year for the next ten years, instead of the $20m they were getting before the continuation fund deal.

PE is devouring the productive economy and making the world's richest people even richer. The one bright light? The FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division just published new merger guidelines that would make the PE acquire/debt-load/asset-strip model illegal:

&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/07/ftc-doj-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/07/ftc-doj-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines&lt;/a&gt;

The bad news is that some sneaky fuck just slipped a 20% FTC budget cut - $50m/year - into the new appropriations bill:

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1681830706488438785"&gt;https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1681830706488438785&lt;/a&gt;

They're scared, and they're fighting dirty.

&lt;img alt="My forthcoming book 'The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation' in various editions: Verso hardcover, audiobook displayed on a phone, and ebook displayed on an e-ink reader." src="https://craphound.com/images/internet-con-ks.jpg"/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Kickstarting a book to end enshittification, because Amazon will not carry it (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/31/seize-the-means-of-computation/#the-internet-con"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

My next book is &lt;em&gt;The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation&lt;/em&gt;: it's a Big Tech disassembly manual that explains how to disenshittify the web and bring back the old good internet. The hardcover comes from Verso on Sept 5, but the audiobook comes from me - because Amazon refuses to sell my audio:

&lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation"&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="This book is the instruction manual Big Tech doesn't want you to read. It deconstructs their crummy products, undemocratic business models, rigged legal regimes, and lies. Crack this book and help build something better. -Astra Taylor, author of Democracy May Not Exist, but We'll Miss It When Its Gone" src="https://craphound.com/images/hero.png"/&gt;

Amazon owns Audible, the monopoly audiobook platform that controls &amp;gt;90% of the audio market. They require &lt;em&gt;mandatory&lt;/em&gt; DRM for every book sold, locking those books forever to Amazon's monopoly platform. If you break up with Amazon, you have to throw away your entire audiobook library.

That's a hell of a lot of leverage to hand to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; company, let alone a rapacious monopoly that ran a program targeting small publishers called "Project Gazelle," where execs were ordered to attack indie publishers "the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle":

&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sadistic-amazon-treated-book-sellers-the-way-a-cheetah-would-pursue-a-sickly-gazelle-2013-10"&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/sadistic-amazon-treated-book-sellers-the-way-a-cheetah-would-pursue-a-sickly-gazelle-2013-10&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="Journalist and novelist Doctorow (Red Team Blues) details a plan for how to break up Big Tech in this impassioned and perceptive manifesto….Doctorow's sense of urgency is contagious -Publishers Weekly" src="https://craphound.com/images/pw.png"/&gt;

I won't sell my work with DRM, because DRM is key to the enshittification of the internet. Enshittification is why the old, good internet died and became "five giant websites filled with screenshots of the other four" (h/t Tom Eastman). When a tech company can lock in its users and suppliers, it can drain value from both sides, using DRM and other lock-in gimmicks to keep their business even as they grow ever more miserable on the platform.

Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="A brilliant barn burner of a book. Cory is one of the sharpest tech critics, and he shows with fierce clarity how our computational future could be otherwise -Kate Crawford, author of The Atlas of AI" src="https://craphound.com/images/crawford.png"/&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The Internet Con&lt;/em&gt; isn't just an analysis of where enshittification comes from: it's a detailed, shovel-ready policy prescription for halting enshittification, throwing it into reverse and bringing back the old, good internet.

How do we do that? With interoperability: the ability to plug new technology into those crapulent, decaying platform. Interop lets you choose which parts of the service you want and block the parts you don't (think of how an adblocker lets you take the take-it-or-leave "offer" from a website and reply with "How about nah?"):

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah&lt;/a&gt;

But interop isn't just about making platforms less terrible - it's an explosive charge that demolishes walled gardens. With interop, you can leave a social media service, but keep talking to the people who stay. With interop, you can leave your mobile platform, but bring your apps and media with you to a rival's service. With interop, you can break up with Amazon, and still keep your audiobooks.

So, if interop is so great, why isn't it everywhere?

Well, it &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be. Interop is how Microsoft became the dominant operating system:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="Nobody gets the internet-both the nuts and bolts that make it hum and the laws that shaped it into the mess it is-quite like Cory, and no one's better qualified to deliver us a user manual for fixing it. That's The Internet Con: a rousing, imaginative, and accessible treatise for correcting our curdled online world. If you care about the internet, get ready to dedicate yourself to making interoperability a reality. -Brian Merchant, author of Blood in the Machine" src="https://craphound.com/images/merchant.png"/&gt;
It's how Apple saved itself from Microsoft's vicious campaign to destroy it:

&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay&lt;/a&gt;

Every tech giant used interop to grow, and then every tech giant promptly turned around and attacked interoperators. Every pirate wants to be an admiral. When Big Tech did it, that was progress; when you do it back to Big Tech, that's &lt;em&gt;piracy&lt;/em&gt;. The tech giants used their monopoly power to make interop without permission illegal, creating a kind of "felony contempt of business model" (h/t Jay Freeman).

&lt;em&gt;The Internet Con&lt;/em&gt; describes how this came to pass, but, more importantly, it tells us how to fix it. It lays out how we can combine different kinds of interop requirements (like the EU's Digital Markets Act and Massachusetts's Right to Repair law) with protections for reverse-engineering and other guerrilla tactics to create a system that is strong without being brittle, hard to cheat on and easy to enforce.

What's more, this book explains &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to get these policies: what existing legislative, regulatory and judicial powers can be invoked to make them a reality. Because we are living through the Great Enshittification, and crises erupt every ten seconds, and when those crises occur, the "good ideas lying around" can move from the fringes to the center in an eyeblink:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/12/only-a-crisis/#lets-gooooo"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/12/only-a-crisis/#lets-gooooo&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="Thoughtfully written and patiently presented, The Internet Con explains how the promise of a free and open internet was lost to predatory business practices and the rush to commodify every aspect of our lives. An essential read for anyone that wants to understand how we lost control of our digital spaces and infrastructure to Silicon Valley’s tech giants, and how we can start fighting to get it back. -Tim Maughan, author of INFINITE DETAIL" src="https://craphound.com/images/maughan.png"/&gt;

After all, we've known Big Tech was rotten for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;, but we had no idea what to do about it. Every time a Big Tech colossus did something ghastly to millions or billions of people, we tried to &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; the tech company. There's no fixing the tech companies. They need to &lt;em&gt;burn&lt;/em&gt;. The way to make users safe from Big Tech predators isn't to make those predators behave better - it's to &lt;em&gt;evacuate those users&lt;/em&gt;:

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/18/urban-wildlife-interface/#combustible-walled-gardens"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/18/urban-wildlife-interface/#combustible-walled-gardens&lt;/a&gt;

I've been campaigning for human rights in the digital world for more than 20 years; I've been EFF's European Director, representing the public interest at the EU, the UN, Westminster, Ottawa and DC. This is the subject I've devoted my life to, and I live my principles. I won't let my books be sold with DRM, which means that Audible won't carry my audiobooks. My agent tells me that this decision has cost me enough money to pay off my mortgage and put my kid through college. That's a price I'm willing to pay if it means that my books aren't enshittification bait.

But not selling on Audible has another cost, one that's more important to me: a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of readers prefer audiobooks and 9 out of 10 of those readers start and end their searches on Audible. When they don't find an author there, they assume no audiobook exists, period. It got so bad I put up an audiobook on Amazon - me, reading an essay, explaining how Audible rips off writers and readers. It's called "Why None of My Audiobooks Are For Sale on Audible":

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="Doctorow has been thinking longer and smarter than anyone else I know about how we create and exchange value in a digital age. -Douglas Rushkoff, author of Present Shock" src="https://craphound.com/images/rushkoff.png"/&gt;

To get my audiobooks into readers' ears, I pre-sell them on Kickstarter. This has been &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt; successful, both financially and as a means of getting other prominent authors to break up with Amazon and use crowdfunding to fill the gap. Writers like Brandon Sanderson are doing heroic work, smashing Amazon's monopoly:

&lt;a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/guest-editorial-cory-doctorow-is-a-bestselling-author-but-audible-wont-carry-his-audiobooks/"&gt;https://www.brandonsanderson.com/guest-editorial-cory-doctorow-is-a-bestselling-author-but-audible-wont-carry-his-audiobooks/&lt;/a&gt;

And to be frank, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; audiobooks, too. I swim every day as physio for a chronic pain condition, and I listen to 2-3 books/month on my underwater MP3 player, disappearing into an imaginary world as I scull back and forth in my public pool. I'm able to get those audiobooks on my MP3 player thanks to Libro.fm, a DRM-free store that supports indie booksellers all over the world:

&lt;a href="https://blog.libro.fm/a-qa-with-mark-pearson-libro-fm-ceo-and-co-founder/"&gt;https://blog.libro.fm/a-qa-with-mark-pearson-libro-fm-ceo-and-co-founder/&lt;/a&gt;

Producing my own audiobooks has been a dream. Working with Skyboat Media, I've gotten narrators like Wil Wheaton, Amber Benson, Neil Gaiman and Stefan Rudnicki for my work:

&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/shop/"&gt;https://craphound.com/shop/&lt;/a&gt;

But for this title, I decided that I would read it myself. After all, I've been podcasting since &lt;em&gt;2006&lt;/em&gt;, reading my own work aloud every week or so, even as I traveled the world and gave &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of speeches about the subject of this book. I was excited (and a little trepedatious) at the prospect, but how could I pass up a chance to work with director Gabrielle de Cuir, who has directed everyone from Anne Hathaway to LeVar Burton to Eric Idle?

Reader, I &lt;em&gt;fucking nailed it&lt;/em&gt;. I went back to those daily recordings fully prepared to hate them, but they were &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; - even &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; (especially after my engineer John Taylor Williams mastered them). Listen for yourself!

&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/cory_doctorow_internet_con_chapter_01"&gt;https://archive.org/details/cory_doctorow_internet_con_chapter_01&lt;/a&gt;

I hope you'll consider backing this Kickstarter. If you've ever read my free, open access, CC-licensed blog posts and novels, or listened to my podcasts, or come to one of my talks and wished there was a way to say thank you, &lt;em&gt;this is it&lt;/em&gt;. These crowdfunders make my DRM-free publishing program viable, even as audiobooks grow more central to a writer's income and even as a single company takes over nearly the entire audiobook market.

Backers can choose from the DRM-free audiobook, DRM-free ebook (EPUB and MOBI) and a hardcover - including a signed, personalized option, fulfilled through the great LA indie bookstore Book Soup:

&lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation"&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation&lt;/a&gt;

What's more, these ebooks and audiobooks are unlike any you'll get anywhere else because they are sold &lt;em&gt;without any terms of service or license agreements&lt;/em&gt;. As has been the case since time immemorial, when you buy these books, they're &lt;em&gt;yours&lt;/em&gt;, and you are allowed to do anything with them that copyright law permits - give them away, lend them to friends, or simply read them with any technology you choose.

As with my previous Kickstarters, backers can get their audiobooks delivered with an app (from libro.fm) or as a folder of MP3s. That helps people who struggle with "sideloading," a process that Apple and Google have made progressively harder, even as they force audiobook and ebook sellers to hand over a 30% app tax on every dollar they make:

&lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/red-team-blues-another-audiobook-that-amazon-wont-sell/posts/3788112"&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/red-team-blues-another-audiobook-that-amazon-wont-sell/posts/3788112&lt;/a&gt;

Enshittification is rotting &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; layer of the tech stack: mobile, payments, hosting, social, delivery, playback. Every tech company is pulling the rug out from under us, using the chokepoints they built between audiences and speakers, artists and fans, to pick all of our pockets.

&lt;em&gt;The Internet Con&lt;/em&gt; isn't just a lament for the internet we lost - it's a plan to get it back. I hope you'll get a copy and share it with the people you love, even as the tech platforms choke off your communities to pad their quarterly numbers.

&lt;img alt="A CCTV observation room, in which a blurry male figure watches a large bank of monitors.

&lt;h1&gt;Supervised AI isn't (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/23/automation-blindness/#humans-in-the-loop"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;

It wasn't just Ottawa: Microsoft Travel published a whole &lt;em&gt;bushel&lt;/em&gt; of absurd articles, including the notorious Ottawa guide recommending that tourists dine at the Ottawa Food Bank ("go on an empty stomach"):

&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/parismarx/status/1692233111260582161"&gt;https://twitter.com/parismarx/status/1692233111260582161&lt;/a&gt;

After Paris Marx pointed out the Ottawa article, &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;'s Nathan McAlone found several more howlers:

&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-removes-embarrassing-offensive-ai-assisted-travel-articles-2023-8"&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-removes-embarrassing-offensive-ai-assisted-travel-articles-2023-8&lt;/a&gt;

There was the article recommending that visitors to Montreal try "a hamburger" and went on to explain that a hamburger was a "sandwich comprised of a ground beef patty, a sliced bun of some kind, and toppings such as lettuce, tomato, cheese, etc" and that some of the best hamburgers in Montreal could be had at McDonald's.

For Anchorage, Microsoft recommended trying the local delicacy known as "seafood," which it defined as "basically any form of sea life regarded as food by humans, prominently including fish and shellfish," going on to say, "seafood is a versatile ingredient, so it makes sense that we eat it worldwide."

In Tokyo, visitors seeking "photo-worthy spots" were advised to "eat Wagyu beef."

There were more.

Microsoft insisted that this wasn't an issue of "unsupervised AI," but rather "human error." On its face, this presents a head-scratcher: is Microsoft saying that a human being erroneously decided to recommend the dining at Ottawa's food bank?

But a close parsing of the mealy-mouthed disclaimer reveals the truth. The unnamed Microsoft spokesdroid only &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to be claiming that this wasn't written by an AI, but they're &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; just saying that the AI that wrote it wasn't "unsupervised." It was a &lt;em&gt;supervised&lt;/em&gt; AI, overseen by a human. Who made an error. Thus: the problem was human error.

This deliberate misdirection actually reveals a deep truth about AI: that the story of AI being managed by a "human in the loop" is a fantasy, because humans are neurologically incapable of maintaining vigilance in watching for rare occurrences.

Our brains wire together neurons that we recruit when we practice a task. When we &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; practice a task, the parts of our brain that we optimized for it get reused. Our brains are finite and so don't have the luxury of reserving precious cells for things we don't do.

That's why the TSA sucks so hard at its job - why they are the world's most skilled water-bottle-detecting X-ray readers, but consistently fail to spot the bombs and guns that red teams successfully smuggle past their checkpoints:

&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/investigation-breaches-us-airports-allowed-weapons-through-n367851"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/investigation-breaches-us-airports-allowed-weapons-through-n367851&lt;/a&gt;

TSA agents (not "officers," please - they're bureaucrats, not cops) spend &lt;em&gt;all day&lt;/em&gt; spotting water bottles that we forget in our carry-ons, but almost &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; tries to smuggle a weapons through a checkpoint - 99.999999% of the guns and knives they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; seize are the result of flier forgetfulness, not a planned hijacking.

In other words, they train &lt;em&gt;all day&lt;/em&gt; to spot water bottles, and the only training they get in spotting knives, guns and bombs is in exercises, or the odd time someone forgets about the hand-cannon they shlep around in their day-pack. Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; they're excellent at spotting water bottles and shit at spotting weapons.

This is an inescapable, biological aspect of human cognition: we &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; maintain vigilance for rare outcomes. This has long been understood in automation circles, where it is called "automation blindness" or "automation inattention":

&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29939767/"&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29939767/&lt;/a&gt;

Here's the thing: if nearly all of the time the machine does the right thing, the human "supervisor" who oversees it becomes &lt;em&gt;incapable&lt;/em&gt; of spotting its error. The job of "review every machine decision and press the green button if it's correct" &lt;em&gt;inevitably&lt;/em&gt; becomes "just press the green button," assuming that the machine is usually right.

This is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; problem. It's why people just click "OK" when they get a bad certificate error in their browsers. 99.99% of the time, the error was caused by someone forgetting to replace an expired certificate, but the problem is, the other 0.01% of the time, it's because criminals are waiting for you to click "OK" so they can steal all your money:

&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ema-report-finds-nearly-80-130300983.html"&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ema-report-finds-nearly-80-130300983.html&lt;/a&gt;

Automation blindness can't be automated away. From interpreting radiographic scans:

&lt;a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/ai-could-safely-automate-some-x-ray-interpretation"&gt;https://healthitanalytics.com/news/ai-could-safely-automate-some-x-ray-interpretation&lt;/a&gt;

to autonomous vehicles:

&lt;a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/automated-vehicles-may-encourage-new-breed-distracted-drivers"&gt;https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/automated-vehicles-may-encourage-new-breed-distracted-drivers&lt;/a&gt;

The "human in the loop" is a figleaf. The &lt;em&gt;whole point&lt;/em&gt; of automation is to create a system that operates at superhuman scale - you don't buy an LLM to write &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; Microsoft Travel article, you get it to write &lt;em&gt;a million&lt;/em&gt; of them, to flood the zone, top the search engines, and dominate the space.

As I wrote earlier: "There's no market for a machine-learning autopilot, or content moderation algorithm, or loan officer, if all it does is cough up a recommendation for a human to evaluate. Either that system will work so poorly that it gets thrown away, or it works so well that the inattentive human just button-mashes 'OK' every time a dialog box appears":

&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/21/let-me-summarize/#i-read-the-abstract"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/21/let-me-summarize/#i-read-the-abstract&lt;/a&gt;

Microsoft - like every corporation - is insatiably horny for firing workers. It has spent the past three years cutting its writing staff to the bone, with the express intention of having AI fill its pages, with humans relegated to skimming the output of the plausible sentence-generators and clicking "OK":

&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-news-cuts-dozens-of-staffers-in-shift-to-ai-2020-5"&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-news-cuts-dozens-of-staffers-in-shift-to-ai-2020-5&lt;/a&gt;

We know about the howlers and the clunkers that Microsoft published, but what about all the other travel articles that don't contain any (obvious) mistakes? These were very likely written by a stochastic parrot, and they comprised training data for a &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; intelligence, the poor schmucks who are supposed to remain vigilant for the "hallucinations" (that is, the habitual, confidently told lies that are the hallmark of AI) in the torrent of "content" that scrolled past their screens:

&lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922&lt;/a&gt;

Like the TSA agents who are fed a steady stream of training data to hone their water-bottle-detection skills, Microsoft's humans in the loop are being asked to pluck atoms of difference out of a raging river of otherwise characterless slurry. They are expected to remain vigilant for something that almost never happens - all while they are racing the clock, charged with preventing a slurry backlog at all costs.

Automation blindness is inescapable - and it's the inconvenient truth that AI boosters conspicuously fail to mention when they are discussing how they will justify the trillion-dollar valuations they ascribe to super-advanced autocomplete systems. Instead, they wave around "humans in the loop," using low-waged workers as props in a Big Store con, just a way to (temporarily) cool the marks.

And what of the people who lose their (vital) jobs to (terminally unsuitable) AI in the course of this long-running, high-stakes infomercial?

&lt;a href="https://crowdfundr.com/queenwest"&gt;https://crowdfundr.com/queenwest&lt;/a&gt;

Steele himself is as extraordinary as his book. I first ran into him through Mackerel Multimedia, the pioneering Canadian multimedia shop that he co-founded in the early 1990s - one of those art-school kids who discovered the Mac, fell in love with the radical possibilities of digital art, and changed the world:

&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/nonfic/mackerel.html"&gt;https://craphound.com/nonfic/mackerel.html&lt;/a&gt;

Steele's pioneering work - in Hypercard, then CDROMs, then Flash - helped define the look-and-feel of the old, good internet; an urbanist feel that owed a debt to Toronto's most beloved adopted urbanist, Jane Jacobs. Steele and Mackerel made things that were beautiful and human-centered, human-scaled and human-adaptable.

Not for nothing, Hypercard presaged the web's critical "view source" affordance, which allowed people to copy, modify, customize and improve on the things that they found delightful or useful; this affordance was later adapted by other human-centered projects like Scratch, and is a powerful tonic against enshittification.

Mackerel didn't survive the first great multimedia mass extinction, but it launched the careers of a whole generation of talented web-writers and builders, and not just its former employees, but also the millions who were touched by its work.

I haven't seen Steele in person in decades, but I follow his work - not as a multimedia artist, but as an urban photographer. Kevin and I follow each other on Flickr - the once great and great again photo-sharing site that survived decades of abuse from Yahoo and Verizon before being taken indie and rescued by the Smugmug folks.

Back in November 2010, Kevin started posting photos of individual storefronts on Queen Street West to Flickr. They were painstakingly labeled and dated, and they multiplied. By the end of the year, there were a couple dozen of them:

&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-posted-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=queenstreetwest&amp;amp;amp;user_id=92518741%40N00&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1&amp;amp;amp;min_upload_date=1073368800&amp;amp;amp;max_upload_date=1294552799"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-posted-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=queenstreetwest&amp;amp;amp;user_id=92518741%40N00&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1&amp;amp;amp;min_upload_date=1073368800&amp;amp;amp;max_upload_date=1294552799&lt;/a&gt;

A year later, there were hundreds:

&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-posted-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=queenstreetwest&amp;amp;amp;user_id=92518741%40N00&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1&amp;amp;amp;min_upload_date=1073368800&amp;amp;amp;max_upload_date=1326088799"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-posted-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=queenstreetwest&amp;amp;amp;user_id=92518741%40N00&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1&amp;amp;amp;min_upload_date=1073368800&amp;amp;amp;max_upload_date=1326088799&lt;/a&gt;

Today, there are over 1,200 of these:

&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=queenstreetwest&amp;amp;amp;user_id=92518741%40N00&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=queenstreetwest&amp;amp;amp;user_id=92518741%40N00&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1&lt;/a&gt;

Now, I know Queen Street West very well. It was once one of Toronto's most bohemian neighborhoods, where my paternal grandfather's fellow refugee Benny Yack has his schmata shop and where my maternal grandfather took my mother and her siblings to trade in their comics for credit at cramped, crammed used bookstores.

I discovered Queen West as a pre-teen, thanks to Bakka Books - now Bakka Phoenix - the oldest science fiction bookstore in the world. I haunted Bakka, and, on the way, found myself drawn into the other stores around it:

&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/48476314831/in/photolist-2gRFMvz-2oJJDCY"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/48476314831/in/photolist-2gRFMvz-2oJJDCY&lt;/a&gt;

There was Silver Snail, a massive comics shop, but a bounty of used bookstores, vintage clothing stores, thrift shops, the indescribably great electronics store Active Surplus and, later, nightclubs like the Rivoli, the Diamond, the Bovine Sex Club and the Zoo Bar.

For a critical decade of my life and more, the stretch of Queen Street that Steele obsessively documented in his Flickr feed had been the center of my life. I watched it thrive and grow - and then collapse into a kind of self-parody, as the original landlords (like Bakka's landlord) died, and their failsons and faildaughters kicked out longstanding tenants and replaced them with multinational "brands" that turned Queen West into a less-convenient, open-air version of the sterile Eaton Centre mall.

Steele, it turns out, was having similar feelings of dismay as the organic, grown, chaotic delight became groomed, sterile and homogenized. After a 2008 fire wiped out an entire block of Queen West - including Duke's Cycle, a city institution that eventually shuttered after more than a century of service - Steele began his documentation project.

Steele had started documenting the street in 2001, but that fire turned a hobby into a &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;. Over and over again, Steele returned to the street, meticulously photographing the same storefronts, capturing a time-series that eventually spanned 16 years, from 2001-2017. Steele gradually stitched these photos together into panoramic collages, reproducing whole blocks:

&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=linearpanorama&amp;amp;amp;user_id=92518741%40N00&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;amp;safe_search=1&amp;amp;amp;tags=linearpanorama&amp;amp;amp;user_id=92518741%40N00&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1&lt;/a&gt;

It is these "linear panoramas" that form the backbone of &lt;em&gt;Portraits of Queen West&lt;/em&gt;. The book runs 162 pages, and it's meant to be read forwards and backwards - start from the front cover and turn the pages to see the north side of the street, along with insets showing details (like the storied Graffiti Alley), and then flip the book over and start again, seeing the south side.

For more than a decade, I've thrilled to my unexpected trips through Steele's time-machine, as he posted his space-and-time-series images of a vanished urbanism, an old, good city that paralleled the old, good web. I got a peek at a PDF of the new book that collects these extraordinary images and immediately pre-ordered a copy.

Steele and his publisher Black Eye Books are crowdfunding presales of the book on Crowdfundr; the book is CAD40 with shipping (there's also a deluxe edition at CAD55, which comes with a signed bookplate and six postcards):

&lt;a href="https://crowdfundr.com/queenwest"&gt;https://crowdfundr.com/queenwest&lt;/a&gt;

After a string of ghastly mayors - each finding new depths of depravity, selfishness and mismanagement to plumb - Toronto just elected its first progressive mayor in a generation, the wonderful Olivia Chow, for whom I used to ring doorbells support of her city council campaigns:

&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/27/olivia-chow-wins-election-as-torontos-first-chinese-canadian-mayor"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/27/olivia-chow-wins-election-as-torontos-first-chinese-canadian-mayor&lt;/a&gt;

Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops. The enshittification of the old, good web continues apace, but there has never been more energy to build a new, good internet - and banish the enshitternet of Big Tech to the scrapheap of history.

In the same way, Toronto's much eroded urbanism, pluralism and livability are both at their lowest ebb in my lifetime - and also at their most hopeful moment of the century. In 1998, the dead-eyed Romneyoid Premier of Ontario Mike Harris "amalgamated" Toronto with its suburbs, putting it at the mercy of car-addled out-of-towners in an act of gerrymandering that all-but-guaranteed that city residents' political choices would be swamped by suburbanites who could be convinced to vote for laughable Tory bumblefucks like Rob Ford.

Overcoming the gerrymander required a massive turnout - not merely a supermajority, but an &lt;em&gt;ultramajority&lt;/em&gt; of politically motivated, organized, committed, &lt;em&gt;pissed off&lt;/em&gt; Torontonians; Chow's election is a minor miracle that is part of the wave of other historic reversals, like the DoJ awakening from its coma to drag Google into court on antitrust charges.

We are a long way away from making a new, good internet that's a worthy successor to the old, good internet, and at least as far from a new, good Toronto that the people of the old, good Toronto would have built but for Tory wreckers and the Christmas-voting turkeys who elevated them to office. But both are possible - and both demand that we fight for them.

Steele's beautiful photodocumentary of one slice of that old, good city doesn't just memorialize the world we lost - it is inspiration for a world that is ours to win.
