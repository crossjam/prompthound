&lt;h1&gt;Powered wheelchairs and Right to Repair (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/08/chair-ish/#r2r"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Here's a miserable story with a mostly happy ending, one that leaves us with work to do, sure, but also with clarity on what to do next and how to do it. It's about Colorado's HB22-1031, "Consumer Right To Repair Powered Wheelchairs," which Governor Jared Polis signed into law last week:
&lt;a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1031#:~:text=Concerning%20a%20requirement%20that%20a,repair%20the%20manufacturer%27s%20powered%20wheelchairs"&gt;https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1031#:~:text=Concerning%20a%20requirement%20that%20a,repair%20the%20manufacturer%27s%20powered%20wheelchairs&lt;/a&gt;
Three million Americans rely on wheelchairs, and many of them use powered wheelchairs. A wheelchair is an amazing assistive device, one that can mean the difference between being stuck at home - or even in bed - and being able to work, go to school, shop, and see family and friends.
Even if you don't use a powered wheelchair, it won't surprise you to learn that they break. A lot. Anyone with a phone or a laptop - tech that travels with us out of the home, into the great and wild outdoors - knows that stuff you take with you into the world takes a lot of knocks.
But when it comes to powered wheelchairs, there are a lot of complicated - and frankly awful - structural factors that virtually guarantee that the chairs will get broken, and then getting them fixed is an incredible hassle. These structural factors are detailed in "Stranded," the US Public Interest Research Group's new report:
&lt;a href="https://uspirgedfund.org/reports/usp/stranded"&gt;https://uspirgedfund.org/reports/usp/stranded&lt;/a&gt;
Stranded's foundation is 141 interviews US wheelchair users about their experiences with wheelchairs, which informs its commercial and legal analysis of the structural problems that underpin those experiences.
The report explains how Medicare narrowly interprets its statutory duties, allowing it to exclude outdoor powered wheelchairs from its program. That means that the majority of Americans who rely on powered wheelchairs have to use indoor wheelchairs, even when outdoors.
No wonder that these chairs break. A lot. As Mark Schmeler from U Pitt told Markian Hawryluk from &lt;em&gt;Kaiser Health News&lt;/em&gt;, "It’s like you’re outside walking around all day with your slippers on."
&lt;a href="https://khn.org/news/article/power-wheelchair-users-right-to-repair-law-no-easy-fix/"&gt;https://khn.org/news/article/power-wheelchair-users-right-to-repair-law-no-easy-fix/&lt;/a&gt;
But it's not just a problem of fragile indoor chairs in a rugged outdoor world. The chairs aren't just indoor chairs, they're &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; indoor chairs. That's down to Medicare's policy of using nationwide low bidders to supply chairs, which produced a winner-take-all duopoly where two private equity-backed manufacturers dominate.
These two companies - Numotion and National Seating and Mobility - have presided over a decline in the quality and durability of chairs, which means that the chairs they make break more often. Because these are PE-backed rollups - companies that used private equity capital and debt leverage to buy all their competitors - they need very high margins to meet investor expectations and cover their debts. That has resulted in deep cuts to the companies' service budgets.
Medicare also has a policy of not funding preventative maintenance and only replacing chairs every five years, which means that these fragile, undermaintained, badly made indoor chairs must last for half a decade. That's why 93% of respondents to the PIRG survey reported broken chairs in the previous year.
But also, the duopoly - whose anticompetitive mergers were waved through by the FTC - refuses to invest in repair, which is why 62% of repairs take 4+ weeks, while &lt;em&gt;40% take 7+ weeks&lt;/em&gt;. That's 7 weeks of being stuck in your home - or even in your bed - while you wait for a technician to get your chair running again. Many of the people interviewed for Stranded can't wait, and continue to use broken chairs. Some of them were severely injured as a result.
Unsurprisingly, wheelchair users and their trusted technicians often end up fixing their own chairs. Fixing a flat tire - or even swapping the little skateboard wheel used to stabilize a chair with a heavy control unit and respirator - is not rocket science. Stranded quotes a wheelchair technician who works for the duopoly: "most repairs to wheelchairs are straightforward and don’t require specialized skills or training, just a familiarity with mechanical devices."
But there are deep structural impediments to independent powered wheelchair repair, impediments that are familiar from other #RightToRepair fights: parts, and DRM. As with mobile phones, tractors, cars, and appliances, parts for powered wheelchairs can be hard to source because the cartel that manufactures them refuses to make them available except to authorized technicians. As is the case with other repair monopolies - like Apple's authorized independent repair program - technicians are not allowed to keep parts in inventory, which means that nearly every repair includes a lengthy delay while parts are ordered and shipped.
Beyond parts, there are the problems of #DigitalRightsManagement (#DRM) in the chairs' electronics. As with GM cars, John Deere tractors, and Apple iPhones, access to these electronics is digitally restricted to authorized technicians with passwords and specialized hardware tokens. Under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (#DMCA), making tools to bypass these access controls is a felony carrying a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison and a $500,000 fine:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors-bc93f471b9c8"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors-bc93f471b9c8&lt;/a&gt;
That means that wheelchair users and independent technicians can't access the diagnostic information from their own chairs, and when they swap in new components, they can't access the configuration tools to get them working, including changing a chair's grip parameters after changing to all-weather tires.
Powered wheelchair users need routine access to these electronics, just to tweak the settings of their chairs. For example, a wheelchair user who gains ability and confidence might want to change the delay settings for their control unit. One of the interview subjects in Stranded compares bad delay settings to "driving with bungee cords." Without access to their electronics, wheelchair users are at the mercy of the under-resourced, delay-prone official technicians, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; at the mercy of Medicare's willingness to authorize payment for tuning this setting.
Now, finally, we come to Colorado's #HB221031, the new right to repair wheelchair laws. Like the model R2R laws that a coalition of monopolistic manufacturers have defeated time and again, in states across America, the law requires manufacturers to supply parts, manuals, and unlock codes to chair owners and independent technicians.
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/apples-cement-overshoes-329856288d13"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/apples-cement-overshoes-329856288d13&lt;/a&gt;
Many of the commentators quoted in the &lt;em&gt;KHN&lt;/em&gt; story and in Stranded make the point that making it easier to fix wheelchairs won't solve all the other problems - a monopolized chair manufacturing market, Medicare policies on preventative maintenance, outdoor chairs, and replacements, etc. They're right.
But this law &lt;em&gt;will make it easier for wheelchair users to repair the chairs they rely on.&lt;/em&gt; It will free them from endless bureaucratic nightmares, from enforced immobility, from isolation from work and school and family and friends. It will remove a burden - a burden that impairs wheelchair users and their families from advocating for the structural fixes we need.
Right to repair laws have been defeated again and again in statehouses across America, thanks to the solidarity of monopolists, who have formed seemingly unbeatable coalitions devoted to ripping off their customers and destroying the planet with infinite mountains of e-waste.
But, as this bill shows, the anti-repair axis &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be defeated. In Massachusetts, Bay Staters overwhelmingly voted in an automotive right to repair laws in a 2020 ballot measure. In New York, the governor just signed an unprecedented right to repair electronics law. And in Colorado, we have the first successful right to repair wheelchairs law.
These successes tell us what we need to do next: replicate New York's electronics repair law, Massachusetts' automotive repair law, and Colorado's wheelchair repair law in other states. Go from strength to strength, victory to victory, shattering the anti-repair axis by picking off its members, one at a time.
All of this will create the political will and the political space for realizing the promise of the FTC's landmark "Nixing the Fix" report:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/07/pro-act-class-war/#we-fixit"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/07/pro-act-class-war/#we-fixit&lt;/a&gt;
And Biden's &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; executive order on Right to Repair:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/10/unnixing-the-fix/#r2r-plus-plus"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/10/unnixing-the-fix/#r2r-plus-plus&lt;/a&gt;
The anti-repair axis's lies - that only they can perform safe and effective repairs - grow thinner every day. The true motivation - extracting monopoly rents - grows more undeniable. As ever, rights for people with disability redound to all of us.
It's not that we're all merely "temporarily able-bodied" (as Liz Henry once memorably put it to me), either. Just as curb-cuts help people with strollers and bikes and grocery buggies, just as subtitles help language learners and people in noisy environments, protecting people with disabilities protects us all. That's why the activism of people with disabilities is activism that we benefits us all.

&lt;h1&gt;Squeeze Me (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#disappearing-act"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
One of America's great novelists is Carl Hiaasen, who manages that brilliant trick of being howlingly funny and brutally scathing in the same breath, the "ha ha only serious" mode that gets me to buy his novels the instant I see them on a shelf.
I discovered Hiaasen through his introductions to John D MacDonald's Travis McGee books, which highlighted the connection between McDonald's enduring lament for the lost, wild, Florida of the pre-tourism era and Hiaasen's own novelistic eulogies for Florida's natural wonders.
Through more than 20 novels for adults and young readers, Hiaasen has married a naturalist's ability to describe the savage beauty of the dwindling pockets of untamed Florida wilderness with a Miami crime reporter's rich stock of absurd-but-true Florida tales.
Florida Man isn't a single character - he's a pantheon: real-estate developer, timeshare hustler, unlicensed zoo owner, crooked politician, racist snowbird, idiot tourist. Hiaasen's books are like anthropological case-studies, but as Twain might have written them.
Each of them is a comeuppance story of some venal person - with a deliciously Dickensian name - getting what they deserve, often at the hands of Skink, Hiaasen's greatest hero: a former reformist governor who quit over corruption and disappeared into Everglades legend.
But though Hiaasen's revenge-plays are absurdist farces, they are realistic in one regard. At the end of each, Florida is no less imperilled. No amount of panther- or gator-devoured Florida Men can dent their population, nor cool their destructive love for Florida itself.
On Saturday, I took a special trip to Vroman's, Pasadena's beloved, century-old institution of a bookstore, now itself on the endangered species list thanks to covid, and there I found a signed hardcover of Hiaasen's latest: SQUEEZE ME.
&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/558233/squeeze-me-by-carl-hiaasen/"&gt;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/558233/squeeze-me-by-carl-hiaasen/&lt;/a&gt;
Naturally, I read it in a single sitting. It is a work of superb, comic genius, concerning as it does the ultimate Florida Man - Donald Trump - being threatened by an invasive incursions of gigantic, plute-devouring Burmese pythons.
SQUEEZE ME is a caper novel that starts when a wealthy Palm Beach heiress - she is a member of the POTUS Pussies, proud septugenarian GOP megadonors - goes missing at a country club fundraiser.
The next day, Angie Armstrong - a disgraced former wildlife cop who lost her job and went to jail for feeding a poacher's hand to a gator - is called in to catch a massive invasive python on the club grounds.
She decapitates it and takes it to her storage-locker freezer, preparatory to turning it over to a state agency for dissection (after all, there's something weird about that massive lump it is digesting).
Meanwhile, the club's ruthless manager has put two and two together and understands that if that snake is dissected and the partially digested Trumpette inside is discovered, it'll be the end of his job.
So begins the caper: a tale of stolen snakes, idiot inheritors, racist Palm Beach aristocrats, presidential tanning-bed servicemen, petty criminals, an amorous Secret Service agent who's been seduced by Melania...
...And a hapless Honduran undocumented migrant whom the President publicly accuses of being the leader of a terrorist anti-Trump militia that murdered the old lady.
All swirling around Angie, a kickass heroine who uses her animal-control noose to collar opossums, pythons, and Florida Men.
SQUEEZE ME makes a sterling case for Trump as the ultimate Florida Man: a snowbird &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a real-estate developer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a white supremacist &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a conspiracist &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a climate denier &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a blowhard. The whole package.
And while SQUEEZE ME is a Hiaasen revenge play of enormous verve and absurdity, it is also true to Hiaasen's core dictum that the unstoppable invasion of Florida Man will be Florida's doom - that the state's spectacular wild places will not be saved.
Hiaasen's traditional version of this doom is two parts real-estate development, one part climate crisis, but, as befits this moment, SQUEEZE ME is more like five parts climate emergency, one part condo development.
By pitting two invasive species - Burmese pythons and Florida Man - against each other, with a background soundtrack of white nationalist Trumpian bleating about "invaders," Hiaasen makes a good case for us &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; being Florida Man.
I discovered Hiaasen through Travis McGee, and this book feels like the later McGee novels: funny and hard-charging, with an undercurrent of sad exhaustion -  taking stock of a life spent trying to change our direction, watching as we continue our cliffwards hurdle.
I laughed aloud in so many places in this book, and cheered for the revenge and just devoured the tale, but it left me with a strange mix of feelings - sadness, rage, delight, like chocolate with a pinch of salt and some habanero.
Hiaasen is one of this country's best, a writer who smuggles in so much under cover of comedy, and this is one of Hiaasen's best.

&lt;a name="user-agents"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/ietfendusers.png"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Internet is for End-Users (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#user-agents"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
One of the most profound latent political statements in internet history was the decision to make "user-agent" the technical term for a web-browser - implying that the browser should work on behalf of its user - and not on behalf of the owner of the server it connects to.
This implication underpins so many of the key struggles over the web's destiny: ad-blocking, stream-ripping, DRM bypassing, tracker-blocking, anonymization, etc. All of these technologies stem from the idea that a browser's first duty is to serve its user.
This duty surpasses any duty to rightsholders, publishers, cops, advertisers, university exam proctors or other third parties, irrespective of the legitimacy of their claims to primacy.
"User-agent" is a way of saying that while users can be foolish (clicking on phishing links), or wicked (posting phishing links) that trying to avert these outcomes by using the browser to control users is a cure that's worse than the disease.
That when you have a system that you use to communicate with your loved ones, get your education, meet with doctors, transmit trade secrets, and do your banking, it should respond to your needs above all others.
Naturally, this is a hotly contested proposition: there are so many entities who could solve their problems by making your browser take orders from THEM, not you.
This desire to control users through the browser was the source of one of the most bitter tech-policy fights I've ever been in: EME, the fight over whether DRM should be part of the W3C's standards for web browsers.
This was a frankly brutal fight over the very soul of the web and the web-browser: a fight over whether the canonical browser spec would say, "The user is in charge of the browser" or "The browser is in charge of the user."
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/07/amid-unprecedented-controversy-w3c-greenlights-drm-web"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/07/amid-unprecedented-controversy-w3c-greenlights-drm-web&lt;/a&gt;
And we lost it. The W3C's reasoning was that the major browser vendors had already made that call, and the users had already lost. Better to have a standardized version of user-control than a wild west of one-off "solutions."
Three years later, our lives are being lived through the browser in a way that surpasses even our most dire warnings in the EME fight, and every petty tyrant is hijacking the browser to extend tendrils of control right into our homes.
Sometimes that's your school, spying on you and your family in the name of "invigilation":
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/20/great-danes/#proctorio"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/20/great-danes/#proctorio&lt;/a&gt;
And sometimes it's your boss, who turned your home into a rent-free branch office and uses your browser to make it stick:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/01/bossware/#bossware"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/01/bossware/#bossware&lt;/a&gt;
All of this has reinvigorated the question of who the web is for: the people who run the servers, or the people who run the browsers.
The IETF, another standards body, has waded into the fray, with Mark Nottingham - an internet pioneer who chairs the IETF HTTP group - weighing in with RFC 8890, AKA "The Internet is for End-Users."
&lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8890.txt"&gt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8890.txt&lt;/a&gt;
Nottingham cites the browser's status as a "user-agent" as central to the Internet Architecture Board's philosophy, that end-users' interests should be favored over those of other parties.
Nottingham has an admirably expansive view of end-users, including parents of children using the internet, people pictured in photos that traverse the internet, people being sensed by internet-connected sensors in a room they've just entered.
He says that the IETF's success lies not in the mere expansion or perfection of the internet - more users, faster speeds, lower latency - but rather in whether the net empowers users, rather than controlling them.
To make users central to IETF work, Nottingham advises engaging with the "internet community" and points of the shortcomings and difficulties of this principle:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many affected users lack the technical knowledge to engage in discussions about IETF work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government representatives are imperfect proxies for the users in their jurisdictions and even worse for users in other countries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Civil society groups - while often technically clued in and a good match for user interests - are resource constrained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nottingham proposes specific outreach to affected user groups whose lives might be affected by IETF work, with the IETF meeting those users where they gather, rather than requiring users to come to the IETF (in the broadest sense).
Nottingham acknowledges that some decisions involve tradeoffs in the wellbeing of different users groups, but cautions against using this as an excuse for failing to try to come up with positive-sum solutions.
The role of computer as obedient helpmeet or unblinking overseer has never been more salient, and Nottingham's intervention here is a really important, thoughtful bridging of the technical and policy implications of that fight.

&lt;h1&gt;Ad-tech is a bubble (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
"Subprime Attention Crisis" is a new book by Tim Hwang that argues that the ad-tech market is a bubble created by an ad industry doing what it does best: convincing advertisers that it is really, really good at selling its products.
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ad-tech-could-be-the-next-internet-bubble/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/ad-tech-could-be-the-next-internet-bubble/&lt;/a&gt;
Think of department story magnate John Wanamaker's infamous "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don’t know which half' and consider what a sell-job he got from his ad-agency if he thought that &lt;em&gt;only half&lt;/em&gt; of his ad spending was wasted!
Writing for Wired, Gilad Edelman praises Hwang's book, which identifies the huge share of ad spending that's siphoned off by the ad-tech industry, which has interposed itself between advertisers and publishers without delivering real value to either.
This is becoming increasingly apparent: consider the Dutch public broadcaster NPO, which swapped out "behavioral ads" (chosen by profiling you) with "contextual ads" (chosen by profiling the web-page it appears on):
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/05/behavioral-v-contextual/#contextual-ads"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/05/behavioral-v-contextual/#contextual-ads&lt;/a&gt;
Not only did NPO see similar or better click-through rates on ads that were served without knowing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about the user, but more users saw those ads because the ads didn't have to get through a tracker blocker.
And, to Hwang's point, these high-performing, highly visible ads each delivered double the money to NPO, because there was no scammy ad-tech industry in the middle raking off a 50% vig for behavioral analysis, real-time auctions and other socially useless smoke-and-mirrors.
Hwang argues that this all adds up to a bubble, where the spending is coming from purchasers who don't know what they're buying - literally, as programmatic ads are placed in realtime, so advertisers don't know which publications run their ads or how they're displayed.
As with every bubble, there's an army of associated huxters pumping away to keep the bubble inflated: ad agencies arbitraging between advertisers and publishers, ad-tech platforms touting their devastating accuracy, and a captured rating agency controlled by FB and Google.
And Hwang points out that ad-tech isn't standalone: it's integral to the entire tech industry, woven into Amazon, Google, FB and even Apple's platforms, subsidizing them and publishers.
When that bubble pops, it will be systemic - like the crash of 2008, which revealed how mortgages had been turned into structural elements of the entire economy.
Hwang wants to avert this calamity with a controlled deflation, with researchers aggressively calling BS on ad-tech claims, and the creation of a better, less scammy advertising ecosystem.
Based on this review, I just bumped Hwang's book to the top of my pile. It certainly seems complementary to my own recent short book, HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM.
&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59&lt;/a&gt;
That book's core thesis is that Big Tech lies about the efficacy of its surveillance/persuasion products and achieves its dominance through common-or-garden monopolization of the sort that mediocre sociopaths have mastered since the days of the Rail Barons.
That surveillance capitalism isn't a "rogue" capitalism, it's just "capitalism" - with surveillance, which it gets away with by creating monopolies that can capture their regulators and enmesh themselves in the national security complex.
This isn't identical to Hwang's formulation, but it's not so divergent, either. From the review, I think the big difference is that Hwang doesn't call for a reinvigoration of traditional antitrust, nor for a renewed and muscular interoperability:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Schools! Libraries! Classrooms! Get free Attack Surface hardcovers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#figuring-it-out"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Figuring out how to tour a book in the lockdown age is hard. Many authors have opted to do a handful of essentially identical events with a couple of stores as a way of spreading out the times so that readers with different work-schedules, etc can make it.
But not me. My next novel, Attack Surface (the third Little Brother book) comes out in the US/Canada on Oct 13 and it touches on so many burning contemporary issues that I rounded up 16 guests for 8 different themed "Attack Surface Lectures."
&lt;a href="https://read.macmillan.com/torforge/cory-doctorow-virtual-lecture-series/"&gt;https://read.macmillan.com/torforge/cory-doctorow-virtual-lecture-series/&lt;/a&gt;
This has many advantages: it allows me to really explore a wide variety of subjects without trying to cram them all into a single event and it allows me to spread out the love to eight fantastic booksellers.
Half of those bookstores (the ones WITHOUT asterices in the listing) have opted to have ME fulfil their orders, meaning that Tor is shipping me all their copies, and I'm going to sign, personalize and mail them from home the day after each event!
(The other half will be sending out books with adhesive-backed bookplates I've signed for them)
All of that is obviously really cool, but there is a huge fly in the ointment: given that all these events are different, what if you want to attend more than one?
This is where things get broken. Each of these booksellers is under severe strain from the pandemic (and the whole sector was under severe strain even before the pandemic), and they're allocating resources - payrolled staff - to after-hours events that cost them real money.
So each of them has a "you have to buy a book to attend" policy. These were pretty common in pre-pandemic times, too, because so many attendees showed up at indie stores that were being destroyed by Amazon, having bought the books on Amazon.
What's more, booksellers with in-person events at least got the possibility that attendees would buy another book while in the store, and/or that people would discover their store through the event and come back - stuff that's not gonna happen with virtual events.
There is, frankly, no good answer to this: no one in the chain has the resources to create and deploy a season's pass system (let alone agree on how the money from it should be divided among booksellers) - and no reader has any use for 8 (or even 2!) copies of the book.
It was my stupid mistake, as I explain here:
&lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/attack-surface-audiobook-for-the-third-little-brother-book/posts/2968670"&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/attack-surface-audiobook-for-the-third-little-brother-book/posts/2968670&lt;/a&gt;
After I posted, several readers suggested one small way I could make this better: let readers who want to attend more than one event donate their extra copies to schools, libraries and other institutions.
Which I am now doing. If you WANT to attend more than one event and you are seeking to gift a copy to an institution, I have a list for you! It's here:
&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/littlebrother/2020/10/05/as-freebies/#thelist"&gt;https://craphound.com/littlebrother/2020/10/05/as-freebies/#thelist&lt;/a&gt;
And if you are affiliated with an institution and you want to put yourself on this list, please complete this form:
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uIXO0iV2RyVN6AtDYd1C7ImxS6V0jHWnMNFK179g6H4/"&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uIXO0iV2RyVN6AtDYd1C7ImxS6V0jHWnMNFK179g6H4/&lt;/a&gt;
If you want to attend more than one event and you want to donate your copy of the book to one of these organizations, choose one from the list and fill its name in on the ticket-purchase page, then email me so I can cross it off the list: doctorow@craphound.com
I know this isn't great, and I apologize. We're all figuring out this book-launch-in-a-pandemic business here, and it was really my mistake. I can't promise I won't make different mistakes if I have to do another virtual tour, but I can promise I won't make this one again.

&lt;h1&gt;Facebook's living will (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#dnr"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
After years of slumber, US and EU antitrust enforcers are beginning to stir, calling tech CEOs in for hearings, opening investigations, and hinting darkly at the possibility of future breakups.
The tech companies have seen this day coming. Many believe the reason Google restructured as Alphabet was to create clean cleavage lines for a future breakup, a means to steer future enforcers (for example, away from forcing Google to split search from advertising).
Now, a leaked internal memo obtained by the WSJ lays out Facebook's plan to avoid breakup. It's a really stupid plan.
&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-government-breakup-of-instagram-whatsapp-would-be-complete-nonstarter-11601803800"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-government-breakup-of-instagram-whatsapp-would-be-complete-nonstarter-11601803800&lt;/a&gt;
As reported on Engadget, the memo basically says, "If you didn't want us to monopolize the sector, you shouldn't have allowed us to buy Whatsapp and Instagram and now that you have, it's too late, nyah."
&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-government-antitrust-breakup-defense-214554210.html"&gt;https://www.engadget.com/facebook-government-antitrust-breakup-defense-214554210.html&lt;/a&gt;
No, really: FB's defense is that because the initial mergers were permitted, that permission can't be subsequently withdrawn.
What this defense fails to account for is:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the subsequent revelation that Zuckerberg undertook the Insta acquisition for illegal anticompetitive purposes (to snuff out a potential future competitor);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the fact that FB defrauded the EU when it promised not to merge the backends of Whatsapp, Insta and Messenger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, FB emphasizes that it spent a lot of money integrating these companies it acquired under false, illegal pretenses, and it would cost a lot to unwind them.
tldr: If we'd known your approval of these mergers was contingent on us not breaking the law, we'd never have committed the resources to buy these services and do illegal frauds with them. It's totally unfair to ask us to stop now.

&lt;h1&gt;Part 17 of Someone Comes to Town Someone Leaves Town (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#scttlst"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
This week on my podcast, part 17 of my reading of my 2006 novel "Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town," a book Gene Wolfe called "a glorious book unlike any book you’ve ever read."
&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/podcast/2020/10/05/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town-part-17/"&gt;https://craphound.com/podcast/2020/10/05/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town-part-17/&lt;/a&gt;
Part 17 comes with a content warning (there's a super grisly murder I hardly remember writing and which shocked me to re-read now) and a bonus (~60 seconds of Ken Campbell's incredible Wol Wontok, a translation of Macbeth into Malakulan pidgin).

&lt;h1&gt;Seeking home call-center workers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#chickenized"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
On Friday, I wrote up Propublica's astounding long-read about Arise, a "work-from-home call-center" where workers end up paying to work - under incredibly abusive conditions - for blue-chips like Disney and Airbnb.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/02/chickenized-by-arise/#arise"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/02/chickenized-by-arise/#arise&lt;/a&gt;
Workers at Arise - almost all women, mostly Black women - are tricked into the deal, then encouraged to make ends meet by recruiting their friends. When they've finally had enough, they have to PAY TO QUIT ("contract termination fees").
Both Propublica's original article and my summary got a lot of attention and now I've heard from Ariana Tobin,  one of the writers on the original story, who writes:
"We’re still collecting stories from call center workers, especially people who work from home regardless of pandemics. If you’ve heard responses from anyone who says they work in the industry, we’ve got a survey they can fill out."
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/have-you-worked-in-customer-service-intuit-apple-concentrix"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/have-you-worked-in-customer-service-intuit-apple-concentrix&lt;/a&gt;
If you or someone you know has been roped into one of these arrangements, please help Propublica and Tobin's team continue to do their excellent work in blowing the lid off this modern-day form of sweatshop labor.

&lt;h1&gt;Podcasting "About Those Killswitched Ukrainian Tractors" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/20/self-destruct-button/#monkeys-paw"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
This week on my podcast, I read my Medium column, "About Those Killswitched Ukrainian Tractors," in which I am a bit of a buzzkill about that feel-good story of a Ukrainian John Deere dealership bricking $5m worth of tractors stolen by Russian looters:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors-bc93f471b9c8"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors-bc93f471b9c8&lt;/a&gt;
In case you missed the underlying story, here's a quick recap. Russian looters, abetted by the Russian military, stole $5m worth of tractors and combines from a Deere dealership in Melitopol, Ukraine. The dealership was able to use the tractors' own electronics to track them to Chechnya - and they were able to send out a self-destruct code that bricked the tractors, rendering them inoperable.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/europe/russia-farm-vehicles-ukraine-disabled-melitopol-intl/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/europe/russia-farm-vehicles-ukraine-disabled-melitopol-intl/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people sent me this story. It's a perfect cyberpunk nugget! But despite the superficial appeal of this electronically delivered comeuppance to Russian looters, this isn't a feel-good story. The underlying lesson here is: "Anyone who can pressure, hack, or convince John Deere can brick any Deere tractor, anywhere."
Who might do such a thing? Well, possibly Russia, whose militarized hacker teams honed their tactics by successfully effecting remote takeovers of critical Ukrainian infrastructure. The same kill-switch that Ukraine used to take down some petty Russian looters could be used by Russian hackers to attack the entire Ukrainian agriculture sector:
&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-11-01/sandworm-andy-greenberg-cybersecurity"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-11-01/sandworm-andy-greenberg-cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;
Which raises the question: why are there kill-switches in Deere tractors? This is a good question to ask about &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kill-switch. As an sf writer, I just &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; those sci-fi movies where someone accidentally hits the self-destruct button on the bridge of a spaceship. I always think, "You know, I'm no aerospace engineer, but wouldn't this be a better spaceship if it wasn't designed to explode?"
The kill-switches in Deere tractors weren't designed to thwart Russian looters - they were designed to thwart &lt;em&gt;American farmers.&lt;/em&gt; Deere's industrial strategy takes its cues from other industries - mobile phones, cars, med-tech, etc: they use tech to lock in their customers, harvest and sell their data, and extract fees from them.
In Deere's case, this started with a data-play: as a top Deere exec boasted to me at a conference some years ago, the company uses the sensors on farmers' tractors to build a centimeter-accurate grid of soil humidity and density. The locks on Deere tractors prevent farmers from accessing this data directly - rather, they are reliant on whatever plans Deere cooks up.
Originally, Deere denied farmers this data, except through their preferred seed partner Monsanto (now Bayer). Deere sold the data - and the farmers - to Monsanto, and farmers who wanted to practice precision agriculture needed to do so with Monsanto seed. Today, Deere allows farmers to download their data from an online portal, but that could change again.
&lt;a href="https://developer-portal.deere.com/#/myjohndeere/field-operations/field-operations-overview"&gt;https://developer-portal.deere.com/#/myjohndeere/field-operations/field-operations-overview&lt;/a&gt;
I'm not surprised to learn that Deere has stopped selling farmers to Bayer, because - as that executive boasted to me - the real money in ag data is in aggregating global soil condition data, from &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Deere customers, and selling it to the finance sector to inform commodity futures trades. Deere sells farmers' data to people making bets against the farmers.
Remember this the next time you hear, "If you're not paying for the product, you're the product." Deere doesn't give away ad-supported tractors. Farmers pay six- and seven-figure sums for Deere equipment - and they're still the product. The thing that determines whether a company can treat you like "product" isn't whether you're paying - it's whether they can get away with it.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/22/mesmer-2-point-oh/#thanks-obama"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/22/mesmer-2-point-oh/#thanks-obama&lt;/a&gt;
Deere can get away with it. Having merged with or acquired so many rivals, they have market power - that is, monopoly power. What's more, the law is on their side. Specifically, they benefit from Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which bans breaking DRM and makes trafficking in DRM-breaking tools a 5-year prison-sentence felony.
This law - and related laws, like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as contract law, trade secrecy, patents, etc - gave rise to a practice called VIN-locking. VIN-locking started in the automotive industry (VIN stands for Vehicle Identification Number), and it's the main battle in the right to repair (R2R) fight.
VINs are the unique identifiers inscribed on cars' engine-blocks, and, these days, indelibly associated with cars' on-board computers. VIN-locking is when new engine parts have to be initialized with a cryptographically signed code that says, "This part is now associated with this engine."
These VIN-locks are protected by the DMCA. Providing a tool to bypass them, which would allow independent mechanics to swap in the part and then initialize it, carries a potential prison sentence of 5 years and a $500K fine for a first offense. Thus, the act of fixing a car without manufacturer authorization becomes a crime.
Manufacturers love the ability to control repair. Not only does being the only game in town mean that you can charge a fortune for parts and service - it also means that you can declare something "beyond repair" and insist that the customer throw away their product and buy a new one.
Farmers have been doing their own repairs since time immemorial - that's why even Roman farmhouse foundations have spaces for forges and workshops. When you're at the end of a country road and the storm is on the horizon, you have to get the crops in, and you can't wait for a mechanic or technician to come and fix the tools you depend on.
Deere owes its business to farmers' tractor modifications and repairs. It once sent field engineers out to farms across America to report back on farmers' innovations, which it then patented (ugh, I know) and incorporated in its future tractors:
&lt;a href="https://securityledger.com/2019/03/opinion-my-grandfathers-john-deere-would-support-our-right-to-repair/"&gt;https://securityledger.com/2019/03/opinion-my-grandfathers-john-deere-would-support-our-right-to-repair/&lt;/a&gt;
Today, Deere says that farmers can't be trusted to use their own tractors after they fix them, and must wait for days or longer for a Deere technician to come out and inspect the fix and type an unlock code into their tractors - after they pay hundreds of dollars for the privilege.
Worse, Deere actually told the US Copyright Office that farmers &lt;em&gt;don't own their tractors&lt;/em&gt; - they &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt;, because the software in the tractor is only &lt;em&gt;licensed&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;sold&lt;/em&gt;, so they have to abide by the tractors' terms of service.
&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2017/04/22/john-deere-just-told-the-copyright-office-that-only-corporations-can-own-property-humans-can-only-license-it/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2017/04/22/john-deere-just-told-the-copyright-office-that-only-corporations-can-own-property-humans-can-only-license-it/&lt;/a&gt;
Deere was joined by other companies in making this claim - notably, GM and other car makers (that is, the companies behind VIN-locking). But it's not just car companies and tractor monopolists who say you can't own (or fix) your stuff. Med-tech companies love this. Take Medtronic, a med-tech monopolist that is one of the lowest-taxed medical companies in the world, thanks to a reverse-merger with an Irish company.
Medtronic makes the workhorse PB840 ventilator, a two decade old product that is widely found in hospitals around the world. Hospital technicians - like farmers - have a long tradition of fixing their own equipment, for much the same reason. When the ventilator breaks, you need to fix it so you can save someone's life, rather than waiting around for a Medtronic technician to show up and charge hundreds of dollars for a service call.
But Medtronic also practices VIN-locking, which means that the simplest, most common repairs - cannibalizing a working part out of a busted ventilator to keep another one going - are no longer possible without breaking the DMCA. That's exactly what hospital med-techs did during lockdown, when demand for ventilators spiked just as Medtronic grounded all its technicians.
This was only possible thanks to a brave, anonymous ex-Medtronic employee, who built illegal circumvention tools inside improvised housings (clock radios, guitar pedals, etc) and mailed them to technicians around the world:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again&lt;/a&gt;
We don't know his name, because the EU's laws - Article 6 of the EUCD - also ban trafficking in circumvention devices.
Whenever right to repair bills come up at the state level, VIN-locking companies team up to defeat them. The ringleader of these anti-repair conspiracies is always Apple, who claimed that letting you fix your phone would lead to your battery exploding and &lt;em&gt;blowing your face off&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia&lt;/a&gt;
These safety claims are repeated by car manufacturers. For example, during the Massachusetts R2R ballot initiative campaign, Big Car ran ads warning that they had built so much spyware into your cars that allowing third party access would lead to you being &lt;em&gt;stalked and murdered&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms&lt;/a&gt;
The automotive sector's claims about defending your security would be more credible if they were better at it. It's hard to take seriously a company's claims that it - not you - understands your security needs when its cars can be hijacked over the internet, allowing randos to steer, break and accelerate your vehicle.
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/&lt;/a&gt;
Kill-switches and VIN-locking go hand-in-hand and they're both security nightmares. In the automotive context, VIN-locking is key to the subprime car lending industry, where trillions of dollars' worth of loans are backed up with ignition immobilizers to make it easier to repo cars when the owner misses a payment.
Owners of subprime cars often miss payments, because the subprime loans are designed for default, offered to people who can't afford them, on deceptive terms, with balloon payments and penalties that allow a dealer to repo and re-sell the same car several times over.
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U2eDJnwz_s"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U2eDJnwz_s&lt;/a&gt;
Dealer kill-switches are a very expedient way to settle disputes over payments. If you claim to be caught up and dealer disagrees, they can just brick your car until you write a check. These kill-switches can be fully autonomous, too: if your lease prohibits you from leaving the county, you will find yourself stranded if you cross the county line.
Among other ghastly outcomes, this has led to families being stranded beyond cellular range after going for a walk in the woods, not realizing that they'd crossed out of the county.
&lt;a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/miss-a-payment-good-luck-moving-that-car/"&gt;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/miss-a-payment-good-luck-moving-that-car/&lt;/a&gt;
But the real problems come when the dealers' own security is compromised. As I often say, no language on Earth contains the phrase "as secure as the IT at a used-car lot." When the dealer gets hacked, every car they've sold gets bricked:
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/03/hacker-bricks-cars/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2010/03/hacker-bricks-cars/&lt;/a&gt;
Deere likes to claim that it plays a vital role in the world's food security because a compromise of its equipment could lead to large-scale ag disruptions. It's half-right: breaking Deere's security &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a nightmare scenario for global food production - but, alas, Deere has &lt;em&gt;very bad security&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/23/reputation-laundry/#deere-john"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/23/reputation-laundry/#deere-john&lt;/a&gt;
Not only is Deere's software riddled with amateur vulnerabilities, the company hasn't submitted any bugs to the CVE database, suggesting that its demonstrably incorrect claims of being capable guardians of the world's food security are actually sincere:
&lt;a href="https://sick.codes/leaky-john-deere-apis-serious-food-supply-chain-vulnerabilities-discovered-by-sick-codes-kevin-kenney-willie-cade/"&gt;https://sick.codes/leaky-john-deere-apis-serious-food-supply-chain-vulnerabilities-discovered-by-sick-codes-kevin-kenney-willie-cade/&lt;/a&gt;
Like car companies, Deere argues that its security duties make independent repair a nonstarter due to the risks this would pose. This is a common argument of companies that use kill-switches and VIN-locks to extract monopoly rents from their customers. It's a claim Medtronic often makes, despite its own terrible security:
&lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/750-000-medtronic-defibrillators-vulnerable-to-hacking/507470932/"&gt;https://www.startribune.com/750-000-medtronic-defibrillators-vulnerable-to-hacking/507470932/&lt;/a&gt;
VIN-locking does resolve some risk. It makes stolen goods a little less valuable to thieves and it makes it harder for third parties to introduce malicious code to devices. But VIN-locking and kill-switching &lt;em&gt;introduce&lt;/em&gt; much graver risks than they offset: the risk that third parties will brick all devices, and the inability of third parties to &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; incompetent code.
You know who understands this? Ukrainian farmers. They lead the world in exporting illegal, alternative firmware for John Deere tractors, which farmers all over the world install to get around Deere's VIN-locking and other odious practices.
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware&lt;/a&gt;
If Russian tractor thieves manage to unbrick their stolen goods, it will likely be with Ukrainian software. Ukrainian farmers live in a low-stability, low-income environment, so it's natural that they would want to escape the rent-seeking and brittleness of Deere's sleazy grift.
We are all living in increasingly unstable times. It's time to put an end to VIN-locking and kill-switching, and start designing our vital systems - phones, cars, medical implants and equipment, and tractors - to be resilient and robust in the face of supply chain breakdowns and hostile takeovers.
The story of Russian hackers getting hoist on their own petard is delicious, I'll grant you, but if you scratch the surface, it's easy to see that this story is only the prelude to a much worse one - where Russians (or crooks, or the US government) shuts down something &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; depend on.

"Saying the quiet part out loud," is a cliche, but like so many shopworn phrases, it has its roots in real truths that bear repetition.
Back in 2017, a bunch of Wall Street bros &lt;em&gt;shouted&lt;/em&gt; the quiet part out loud.
&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/4/29/15471634/american-airlines-raise"&gt;https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/4/29/15471634/american-airlines-raise&lt;/a&gt;
The occasion was an American Airlines earnings call in which management revealed that the company had recorded solid profits and was going to use some of them to bring pilots and flight-attendants wages up to parity with Delta and United.
Wall Street &lt;em&gt;lost its shit&lt;/em&gt;. The iconic example was Citi analyst Kevin Crissey, who whined:
"This is frustrating. Labor is being paid first again."
Wall Street agreed with Crissey. AA's share price plummeted.
&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-american-airlines-raises-20170427-story.html"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-american-airlines-raises-20170427-story.html&lt;/a&gt;
Crissey was voicing a fundamental truth:
Irrespective of how much profit a company makes, the investors' earnings go up when the workers' earnings go down.
Now, it's true that happy, secure workers can be more productive and secure higher profits, but that doesn't automatically mean that paying higher wages will make more money for shareholders.
If the additional sums needed to make workers happy and secure swallow the excess profits that security generates, then investors are better off with miserable, scared, unproductive workers.
Not only that: if the investors' position is short-term, looking for the highest yield over a single quarter or even less, the fact that higher wages will lead to &lt;em&gt;long-term&lt;/em&gt; advantages, like worker retention and productivity, is irrelevant to the investors' interests.
That's the quiet part: between workers and investors, there's a zero-sum game. Forty years of anti-labor policies (undermining unions, workplace protections) culminating in the "gig economy" all-out assault on the &lt;em&gt;idea of employment itself&lt;/em&gt; have papered over this core truth.
While gig economy companies were spending $200m in deceptive scare-ads to pass California's Prop 22 - which formalized worker misclassification, allowing bosses to fire employees and re-hire them as union-ineligible "independent contractors" - they insisted this was good for workers.
"Worker flexibility" has been the rallying cry of the shareholder class for decades - even as they maximized &lt;em&gt;employer&lt;/em&gt; flexibility and bound workers in legal and economic shackles.
The number one source of noncompete agreements in America today is fast-food chains - where a sub-starvation minimum-wage (or tipped minimum) job is likely to come with a legal prohibition on taking a better job in the industry for &lt;em&gt;three years&lt;/em&gt; after you quit this one.
Thus bound over to their employers, workers were subjected to zero-hours contracting terms, where you are not guaranteed &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; shifts in a given week, but must take &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; shifts you are offered.
If you're scheduled for a graveyard shift until 3AM and then a morning shift the next day that starts at 6AM, you have two choices - take the double-shift or look for work elsewhere (just not in the same industry).
This "flexibility" transfers all the value from the employees' side of the ledger to the bosses'. Bosses get to schedule based on demand, or in order to ensure that workers don't cross the weekly hours threshold that would entitle them to benefits.
Workers, meanwhile, can't schedule another job, or childcare, or continuing education. There's a tiny minority of legit freelancers (including me) for whom contract work is genuinely beneficial - but almost every "independent contractor" is actually a misclassified employee.
A new McKinsney-Ipsos poll shows up the myth of the happy, flexible contract worker. 62% of gig workers overall want real jobs - that number rises sharply for PoCs in gig jobs: for immigrant workers, the figure is 76%.
&lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/covid-response-center/covid-19-impact/impact-on-economies/unequal-america-ten-insights-on-the-state-of-economic-opportunity#"&gt;https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/covid-response-center/covid-19-impact/impact-on-economies/unequal-america-ten-insights-on-the-state-of-economic-opportunity#&lt;/a&gt;
As striking as that figure is, it is even more significant when places alongside another finding: 70% of &lt;em&gt;employers&lt;/em&gt; want to fire their workers and replace them with part-timers, temps and gig workers.
Employers have always been comfortable with waging class war - they just don't like to talk about it.
The poll found that most Americans have a poor economic outlook and half of US workers are "on the brink of financial ruin."
Despite neoliberal rhetoric, a firm that replaces jobs with gig/contract/temp roles is not engaged in "job creation."
That is literal job &lt;em&gt;destruction&lt;/em&gt; - turning "jobs" into precarious, sub-starvation contracts with no rights or protections.
Workers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want "flexibility" - like protection from noncompetes (the flexibility to take a better job), from arbitration waivers (the flexibility to sue your abusive boss).
Workers want protection from arbitrary shift assignments (the flexibility to plan your family and other work and life activities), universal health care, child care and sick leave (the flexibility to take care of your health without losing your job and home).
Flexibility is great, but like wages, it's zero-sum. The more flexibility workers have, the less flexibility their employers have. Giving workers flexibility means depriving employers of the flexibility to abuse, underpay and fire those workers.
Workers are wise to that fact. The quiet part has been said out loud, forcefully and for a long time.

Canada's Bill C-10 is a federal regulation of Canadians' online expression, from podcasts, social media and blogs to other user-generated content.
Despite claims from the ruling Liberals that opposition to this bill is Tory partisanship, this is a universal issue.
As always, Michael Geist has had the best analysis of how C-10 goes well beyond the government's claims of modest and sensible rules of the road, instead empowering the CRTC to order blocks and takedowns of otherwise legal content.
Here's Geist on why the bill does not pass muster with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms:

On the inevitability of site-blocking under C-10:

On the incompatibility of C-10 with Net Neutrality:

and on the bad faith, Trumpian cries of "fake news" by the Liberal Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault.
&lt;a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/05/who-is-wearing-a-tin-foil-hat-now-heritage-minister-steven-guilbeault-suggests-corporate-inspired-misinformation-campaign-the-cause-of-bill-c-10-criticism/"&gt;https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/05/who-is-wearing-a-tin-foil-hat-now-heritage-minister-steven-guilbeault-suggests-corporate-inspired-misinformation-campaign-the-cause-of-bill-c-10-criticism/&lt;/a&gt;
Contrary to M Guibeault's smears, opposition to C-10 isn't a Tory conspiracy. I have never carried water for the Tories - I've rung doorbells to campaign against them federally, provincially, municipally, and internationally, when I lived in the UK.
The Liberals' track record on internet regulation is terrible (remember Sam Bulte's jeremiad against "user-rights zealots"?), but the Tories are even worse. Long before Tony Clement was caught sending pictures of his junk to random women, he was ramming through Canada's DMCA.
Indeed, it's precisely because I know how Stephen Harper would have weaponised C-10 that I want it staked through the heart.
(And if you think Harper's C-10 would be bad, imagine PM Doug Ford wielding it - or PM Faith Goldy)
The Heritage Ministry is accepting comments on C-10 until May 31. Today is the #NoSiteBlocking national day of action, organised by Openmedia.ca.
They've got a page of bilingual resources for filing your comments:

Bill C-10 is a gift to Canada's outrageous telecoms monopolies: Bell, Shaw and Rogers. Canada has spent decades treating telecoms and internet laws as political conveniences, ignoring the digital divide, monopolism and the consequences of mass surveillance.
It's time the country treated the care, maintenance and growth of its digital nervous system with the gravitas and public interest it warrants - even if that means slight reductions in profits to the monopolists who have served Canadians so poorly.

Remember when they sneered at Geocities pages for being unusable eyesores? It's true, those old sites had some, uh, &lt;em&gt;idiosyncratic&lt;/em&gt; design choices, but at least they reflected a real person's exuberant ideas about what looked and worked well. Today's web is an unusable eyesore &lt;em&gt;by design&lt;/em&gt;.
Start with those fucking "sign up for our newsletter" interruptors. Email is the last federated protocol standing, so everyone who publishes is desperate to get you to sign up to their newsletter, which nominally bypasses Big Tech's chokepoint on communications between creators and audiences. Worst part: they're wrong, email's also been captured:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d&lt;/a&gt;
Then there's the designer's bizarre and sadistic conceit that "black type on a white background" is ugly and "causes eye-strain." This has led to an epidemic of illegible grey-on-white type that I literally can't read, thanks to a (very common) low-contrast vision disability:
&lt;a href="https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/"&gt;https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/&lt;/a&gt;
Often grey-on-white type sins are compounded with minuscule font sizing. You can correct this by increasing the font size from teeny-weeny-eyestrain-o-rama to something reasonable, but when you do, all the static elements on the page size up with the text, so the useless header and footer bars filled with social media buttons and vanity branding expand to fill the whole screen.
This, in turn, is made a billion times worse by the absurd decision to hide scrollbars (shades of Douglas Adams' description of airports where they "expose the plumbing on the grounds that it is functional, and conceal the location of the departure gates, presumably on the grounds that they are not").
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3205828-it-can-hardly-be-a-coincidence-that-no-language-on"&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3205828-it-can-hardly-be-a-coincidence-that-no-language-on&lt;/a&gt;
Scrolling a window (without using RSI-inflaming trackpad gestures) is now the world's shittiest, most widely played video-game, a hand-eye coordination challenge requiring sub-pixel accuracy and split-second timing to catch the scroll-bar handle in the brief, flashing instant where blips into existence:
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1516136202235043841"&gt;https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1516136202235043841&lt;/a&gt;
One of the scariest things about the precarity of Firefox is the prospect of losing some of the customizations and stock features I rely on to decrapify the web - stuff I use so often that I sometimes forget that it's not how everyone uses the web:
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/firefox-mozilla-2022/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/firefox-mozilla-2022/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="Two side-by-side screenshots comparing the default layout of a wired.com article ('The intoxicating pleasure of conspiratorial thinking' by Virginia Heffernan) with the same article in Firefox's Reader Mode." src="https://craphound.com/images/reader-mode.jpeg"/&gt;
For example, there's Firefox's Reader Mode: a hotkey that strips out all the layout and renders the text of an article as a narrow, readable column in whatever your default font is. I reach for ctrl-alt-r so instinctively that often the publisher's default layout doesn't register for me.
Reader Mode (usually) bypasses interruptors and static elements, but Firefox isn't capable of deploying Reader Mode on every site. The Activate Reader View plugin can sometimes fix this:
&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/activate-reader-view/"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/activate-reader-view/&lt;/a&gt;
But when it can't there's my favorite, indispensable Javascript bookmarklet: Kill Sticky, which hunts through the DOM of the page you've got loaded and nukes any element that is tagged as "sticky" - which generally banishes any permanent top/bottom/side-bars with a single click:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/t-mart/kill-sticky"&gt;https://github.com/t-mart/kill-sticky&lt;/a&gt;
A recent addition to my arsenal is Cookie Remover. Click it once and it deletes all cookies associated with the page you've currently loaded. This resets the counter on every soft paywall, including the ones that block you from using Private Browsing. Click this once, then reload, and you're back in business:
&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-remover/"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-remover/&lt;/a&gt;
Today, I added another plug-in to my decrapification rotation: Consent-O-Matic, created by researchers at Denmark's Aarhus University. Consent-O-Matic identifies about 50 of the most commonly deployed GDPR tracking opt-out dialog boxes and automatically opts you out of all tracking, invisibly and instantaneously:
&lt;a href="https://consentomatic.au.dk/"&gt;https://consentomatic.au.dk/&lt;/a&gt;
We shouldn't need Consent-O-Matic, but we do. The point of the GDPR was to make tracking users painful for internet companies, by forcing them to break down all the different data they wanted to gather and the uses they wanted to put it to into a series of simple, yes/no consent requests. The idea was to create boardroom discussions where one person said, "OK, let's collect this invasive piece of data" and someone else could say, "Fine, but that will require us to display eight additional dialog boxes so we'll lose 95% of users if we do."
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/26/ico-ico/#market-structuring"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/26/ico-ico/#market-structuring&lt;/a&gt;
What's more, the GDPR said that if you just bypassed all those dialog boxes (say, by flipping to Reader Mode), the publisher had to assume you &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; want to be tracked.
But that's not how it's worked. A series of structural weaknesses in European federalism and the text of the GDPR itself have served to encrapify the web to a previously unheard-of degree, subjecting users to endless cookie consent forms that are designed to trick you into opting into surveillance.
Part of this is an enforcement problem. The EU Commission we have today isn't the Commission that created the GDPR, and there's a pervasive belief that the current Commission decided that enforcing their predecessors' policies wasn't a priority. This issue is very hot today, as the Commission considers landmark rules like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), whose enforcement will be at the whim of their successors.
The failures of EU-wide enforcement is compounded by the very nature of European federalism, which gives member states broad latitude to interpret and enforce EU regulations. This is most obviously manifested in EU member states' tax policies, with rogue nations like Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Ireland vying for supreme onshore-offshore tax haven status.
Not surprisingly, countries whose tax-codes have been hijacked by multinational corporations and their enablers in government are likewise subject to having their other regulations captured by the companies that fly their flags of convenience.
America's biggest Big Tech giants all pretend to be headquartered in Ireland (which, in turn, allows them to pretend that their profits are hovering in a state of untaxable grace far above the Irish Sea). These same companies ensured that Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner's Office is starved of cash and resources. Big Tech argues that their Irish domicile means that anyone who wants to complain about their frequent and enthusiastic practice of wiping their asses with the text of the GDPR has to take it up with the starveling regulators of Ireland.
That may change. Max Schrems - whose advocacy gave rise to the GDPR in the first place - has dragged the tech giants in front of &lt;em&gt;German&lt;/em&gt; regulators, who are decidedly more energetic than their Irish counterparts:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/#noyb"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/#noyb&lt;/a&gt;
The new EU tech competition laws - the DMA and DSA - aim to fix this, shoring up enforcement in a way that should end these "consent" popups. They also seek to plug the GDPR's "legitimate purpose" loophole, which lets tech companies spy on you and sell your data without your consent, provided they claim that this is for a "legitimate purpose."
But in the meantime, GDPR consent dialogs remain a hot mess, which is where Consent-O-Matic comes in. Consent-O-Matic automates away the tedious work of locating all the different switches you have to click before you &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; opt out of consent-based tracking. This practice of requiring you to seek out multiple UI elements is often termed a "Dark Pattern":
&lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3313831.3376321"&gt;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3313831.3376321&lt;/a&gt;
But while "Dark Pattern" has some utility as a term-of-art, I think that it's best reserved for truly sneaky tactics. Most of what we call "Dark Patterns" fits comfortably in under the term "fraud." For example, if "Opt Out of All" doesn't opt out of all, unless you find and toggle another "I Really Mean It" box, that's not a fiendish trick, it's just a scam.
Whether you call this "fraud" or a "Dark Pattern," Consent-O-Matic has historic precedent that suggests that it could really make a difference. I'm thinking here of the original browser wars, where Netscape and Internet Explorer (and others like Opera) fought for dominance on the early web.
That early web had its own crapification: the ubiquitous pop-up ad. Merely opening a page could spawn &lt;em&gt;dozens&lt;/em&gt; of pop-ups, some of them invisible 1px-by-1px dots, others that would run away from your cursor across the screen if you tried to close them, and they'd all be tracking you and auto-playing 8-bit music.
The pop-up ad was killed by the pop-up &lt;em&gt;blocker&lt;/em&gt;. When browsers like Mozilla and Opera started blocking pop-ups by default, users switched to them in droves. That meant that an ever-smaller proportion of web users could even &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; a pop-up, which meant that advertisers stopped demanding pop-ups. Publishers - who knew their readers hated pop-ups but were beholden to advertisers to keep the lights on - were finally able to convince advertisers that pop-ups were a bad idea. Why pay for ads that no one will see?
Pop-up blockers are an early example of Adversarial Interoperability, AKA Competitive Compatibility (comcom for short). That's the practice of improving an existing product or service by making an add-on or plug in that changes how it behaves to make it more responsive to its users' interests, without permission from the original manufacturer:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability&lt;/a&gt;
It's been more than 20 years since the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) tried to get tech companies to voluntarily recognize and honor their users' privacy choices. It failed:
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3P"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3P&lt;/a&gt;
Do Not Track, another attempt to do the same, did not fare much better:
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track&lt;/a&gt;
But you know what actually worked? Tracker-blockers and ad-blockers, "the largest consumer boycott in history":
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah&lt;/a&gt;
Making it &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to track users is of great assistance to efforts to make it &lt;em&gt;illegal&lt;/em&gt; to track users. Tools like Consent-O-Matic change the "security economics" of crapification, by turning the consent theater of illegal cookie popups into actual, GDPR-enforceable demands by users not to be tracked:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/automation-is-magic-f4c1401d1f0d"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/automation-is-magic-f4c1401d1f0d&lt;/a&gt;
Decrapifying the web is a long, slow process. It's not just using interoperability to restore pluralism to the web, ending the era of "five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of text from the other four":
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040"&gt;https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040&lt;/a&gt;
It's also using a mix of technology and regulation to fight back against deliberate crapification. Between Consent-O-Matic, Reader Mode, Kill Sticky and Cookie Remover, it's possible to decrapify much of your daily browsing and substantially improve your life.

&lt;h1&gt;The Business Roundtable's climate plan was killed by its arch-rival, the Business Roundtable (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/19/handmaidens-to-extinction/#deeds-not-words"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Three years ago to the day, the Business Roundtable unveiled its "Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation" - a commitment by its 200 member-CEOs and companies to protect the environment. Then they spent three years and millions of dollars lobbying against that goal.
&lt;a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans"&gt;https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans&lt;/a&gt;
Writing in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, Adam Lowenstein rounds up the Business Roundtable's deep-pocketed, highly effective lobbying campaign, which has crushed numerous climate initiatives in the US, possibly dooming the human race to extinction.
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable&lt;/a&gt;
The Roundtable bills itself as "an association of CEOs of leading US companies working to promote a thriving economy &amp;amp; expanded opportunity for all Americans through sound public policy." Its members include the CEOs of the country's most politically connected corporations, including Apple, Pepsi, Walmart and Google - the most powerful people in the nation.
But while the Roundtable continues to trumpet its commitment to addressing the climate emergency, it has mobilized millions of dollars to neutralize our best hopes of dealing with that emergency. The Roundtable's initiatives include spending millions lobbying against Build Back Better and its carbon reduction/clean energy provisions.
The Roundtable has gone to war against a SEC rule requiring publicly listed companies to disclose their carbon emissions and risks from climate change. Instead, the Roundtable prefers "voluntary" disclosures that allow companies to omit emissions and risks in their supply chains. The Roundtable has met with the SEC three times to oppose this rule, and Roundtable chairman Mary Barra (CEO of GM) personally met with SEC chair Gary Gensler.
In the first half of 2022, the Roundtable's lobbying budget was $9.1m, much of which went to opposing a climate disclosure rule. The Roundtable says that measuring supply chain emissions is too burdensome - the fact that the majority of emissions are in the supply chain is just a coincidence.
Meanwhile, the Roundtable continues to insist that "we have to move now," and that the best way to address the climate emergency is through "market-based" solutions where investors choose "green" investments based on reliable information about companies' contribution to imminent human extinction.
The Roundtable insists that "voluntary disclosures" will provide sufficiently accurate information to allow investors to direct their money away from companies that will murder them and their children by rendering the planet unfit for human habitation. Every other stakeholder - "many investors, analysts, academics, voters and experts, even companies themselves" - disagrees vehemently.
The calls for mandatory disclosure aren't emanating from campus Maoists and Greta Thunberg's child army - they're coming from giant, institutional investors, like this group of fund managers who direct $5t in capital:
&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/aoa4f52ok2i4t06/Letter%20to%20SEC_Climate%20Disclosure%20Rule.pdf"&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/aoa4f52ok2i4t06/Letter%20to%20SEC_Climate%20Disclosure%20Rule.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
The Roundtable's most powerful members, like Apple CEO Tim Cook and Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, have also called for mandatory disclosure. I'm sure they're frustrated that the organization won't listen to them - it's just that they're not frustrated enough to pull their funding from the Roundtable. After all, mostly the Roundtable lobbies to be sure they don't pay taxes and can abuse their workers with impunity - weighed against those advantages, the Roundtable's commitment to wiping out the human species is but a trifle.
It's not just that the Roundtable's members won't hold the organization to its environmental commitments - the Roundtable also won't hold the members to account on those commitments. Companies that signed the 2019 declaration were convicted of &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; environmental infractions and emitted &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; carbon that similar firms that didn't sign:
&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3609056"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3609056&lt;/a&gt;
And since 2019, the signatories to the environmental pledge were offered many chances to "formalize the pledge in corporate governance," and virtually every time this happened, those signatories chose &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to make good on their promises:
&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3899421"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3899421&lt;/a&gt;
The Roundtable's opposition to climate action continues to this day. The org came out hard against the Inflation Reduction Act, which has billions in clean energy incentives - they objected to the 15% minimum corporate tax that will offset those billions in the federal budget:
&lt;a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-opposes-the-inflation-reduction-act"&gt;https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-opposes-the-inflation-reduction-act&lt;/a&gt;
To be fair to them, we don't need to tax corporations - or anyone else - to pay for climate action. The US government is constrained by resources (which things are for sale in US dollars), not money (which it can create by typing into a spreadsheet).
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/17/disgracenote/#false-consciousness"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/17/disgracenote/#false-consciousness&lt;/a&gt;
The point of taxing companies is to constrain what their shareholders can buy - because those purchases might consume resources needed for the climate emergency; and, importantly, to prevent them from spending profits to corrupt the government:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/18/bipartisan-consensus/#corruption"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/18/bipartisan-consensus/#corruption&lt;/a&gt;
Meanwhile, the CEOs who keep the Roundtable afloat keep declaring that time is short, action must be taken, and no price is too high for action.
And again, to be fair, there is no course of action so radical that these corporations and CEOs won't promise to take it - provided they never, ever have to lift a finger to follow through on that promise.

&lt;h1&gt;The PRO Act and worker misclassification (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/07/pro-act-class-war/#sectoral-balances"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
One of the Biden admin's most important pieces of legislation is the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act), which reverses decades of union-busting policies and laws that have led to widening inequality, wage stagnation, and working poverty across America.
It's the first pro-worker law since 1935's NLRA, and it restores many of the rights to organize unions and create serious penalties for employers who break the law to prevent their workers from unionizing (today, employers break labor laws with impunity).
For a great, plain-language breakdown of its contours, check out this breakdown by Kim Kelly, Teen Vogue's labor reporter. Note that the law bans many of the dirtiest tricks used by Amazon to defeat the union drive in its Bessemer, Alabama warehouse.
&lt;a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-the-pro-act"&gt;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-the-pro-act&lt;/a&gt;
The PRO Act doesn't just restore the labor rights that have been stripped away from American workers - it also creates new protections to address the epidemic of worker misclassification where "gig economy" employees are falsely characterized as "independent contractors."
The gig companies - who use worker misclassification to pay sub-minimum-wage salaries and deny basic workplace protections - spent $200m to pass California's Proposition 22. Immediately, bosses fired their union workers and replaced them with gig workers.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22&lt;/a&gt;
Companies like Uber and Lyft have already showered $1.2m in a matter of weeks on DC politicians, lobbying against the PRO Act. That's not surprising, but what is interesting is their SEC-mandated disclosures about what they expect from the PRO Act:
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/05/06/pro-act-uber-lyft-doordash-instacart-lobbying/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2021/05/06/pro-act-uber-lyft-doordash-instacart-lobbying/&lt;/a&gt;
“If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs." -Uber.
This is a very frank admission of what's at stake here. Corporations understand that the market allows companies to claim an ever-larger share of the proceeds of workers' labor, and that the only way to reverse that lopsided distribution is for workers to organize.
They acknowledge that when workers speak directly to customers about their labor conditions and withhold their labor in the face of unfair practices, corporations suffer - that is, the corporations win when workers are powerless and customers are ignorant.
Passing the PRO Act will not be easy. Establishment Dems like Mark Warner have signalled that they will side with bosses over workers on this bill.
&lt;a href="https://discourseblog.com/mark-warner-pro-act-labor-democrats/"&gt;https://discourseblog.com/mark-warner-pro-act-labor-democrats/&lt;/a&gt;
Warner falsely claims that the bill will take away the right of gig workers &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be unionized. This is just not true, as More Perfect Union reminds us: "This lets independent contractors join a union. It doesn’t force them to."
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1389587206298341382"&gt;https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1389587206298341382&lt;/a&gt;
The entire gig economy runs on idiotic lies like this one. Take the premise that workers are independent, organized into "two-sided markets" by apps that match workers and work, and that manage the process with cool, machine-like objectivity.
As is always the case with disciplinary technology, the gig work app isn't actually in charge - it's just a convenient way for human beings to hide their sadistic behavior behind a scrim of technology theater.
Think of Amazon Delivery Service Partner (DSP) drivers. Amazon maintains the pretense that these workers aren't employees OR contractors - they say that they're SUBcontractors, working for "entrepreneurs" who contract with Amazon to make deliveries.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex&lt;/a&gt;
DSP drivers wear Amazon uniforms and drive vans with the Amazon logo. They are surveilled by multiple interior and exterior cameras that track their location, their driving, and (checks notes) their facial expressions?!
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/some-amazon-drivers-have-had-enough-can-they-unionize/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/some-amazon-drivers-have-had-enough-can-they-unionize/&lt;/a&gt;
Amazon gives its 2,500 DSP owners impossible delivery goals, and the DSP owners pass those on to their 158,000 drivers. This is why drivers have to piss and shit in bags in their trucks, a fact that Amazon denied even though they knew it was true:
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/25/amazon-delivery-workers-bathrooms-memo"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/25/amazon-delivery-workers-bathrooms-memo&lt;/a&gt;
But for all the electronic monitoring and micromanaging that DSP drivers endure, the exploitation they face is anything but automated. When DSP drivers are forced to work in dangerous and inhumane conditions, it's because human beings are imposing that on them.
Remember all those apps that monitor drivers? The DSP owners instruct their drivers to turn them off whenever there's a delivery crunch, and then order drivers to proceed at unsafe speeds on residential streets to make Amazon's quotas:
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgxx54/amazon-drivers-are-instructed-to-drive-recklessly-to-meet-delivery-quotas"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgxx54/amazon-drivers-are-instructed-to-drive-recklessly-to-meet-delivery-quotas&lt;/a&gt;
Workers who refuse to drive unsafely are disciplined and fired (those automated systems ensure that there's always some excuse for firing a worker, and the worker's misclassification as an independent contractor means they have no recourse in the face of unjust dismissals).
Amazon says this is all the work of rogue contractors, and not the result of its impossible quota system.
Worker misclassification lets Amazon have its cake and eat it too - force workers to shit in bags and risk their lives driving too fast, and then claim innocence.
Worker protections start with being recognized as a worker. Ending worker misclassification isn't incidental to the PRO Act, it's at its heart: without it, every worker who stands up for their rights will be reclassified as a contractor and crushed.

In world of morally compromised technology and markets, a few entities stand out as consistently on the side of right. Consumer Reports is one of them.
For 85 years, they have produced rigorous, unbiased, trustworthy accounts of the manufactured goods in our lives.
As good as they are at this, understanding digital technology requires significant changes, as software-based devices (especially those that interact with remote services) are difficult to evaluate in the lab, since their characteristics can be silently altered at any time.
CR rose to this challenge with a series of excellent, in-depth cybersecurity breakdowns of products and services, but it's still early days.
Enter the CR Digital Lab, with nonresidential fellowships "to uncover and address emerging consumer harms."
&lt;a href="https://digital-lab.consumerreports.org/join/"&gt;https://digital-lab.consumerreports.org/join/&lt;/a&gt;
These are paid ($50k!) one-year fellowships " of interest to engineers, computer scientists, information security professionals, independent researchers, academics, social scientists, and others."
Fellows work with CR's reporters and advocates, get access to its lab facilities, and work with its wide-ranging network of public-interest technologists.
You have until May 21 to apply.

&lt;img alt="EFF's Right to Repair logo: a green flag with a crossed hammer and crescent wrench in a centered yellow circle." src="https://craphound.com/images/tinker-tech.png"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The FTC's (kick-ass) Right to Repair report (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/07/pro-act-class-war/#we-fixit"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
It's been nearly two years since the FTC's Nixing the Fix workshop on how corporations have sabotage our right to repair. Finally, the Commission has issued its report, and it's hugely vindicating for R2R advocates.
&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
If you don't have time to read the 56-page report, check out Ifixit's cheat-sheet, which highlights the salient points, namely:
&lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50251/ftc-report-congress-nixing-fix-repair-restrictions-reactions"&gt;https://www.ifixit.com/News/50251/ftc-report-congress-nixing-fix-repair-restrictions-reactions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies routinely violate federal law by voiding their customers' warranties in retaliation for seeking independent repair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-repair tactics more heavily harm Black people and communities of color&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic made independent repair sabotage even more important&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies sabotage repair by: designing products to make it harder to fix them; withholding parts and manuals; targeting customers with anti-repair FUD; abusing patent and trademark; using DRM; and imposing abusive EULAs on customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission found that the manufacturers claims about why they should monopolize repair are bullshit:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing independent repair info doesn't harm manufacturers' IP rights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data need to make repair doesn't qualify as a trade secret&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission also found that the real safety concern with independent repair is that manufacturers' sabotage makes it harder for indie repairers to fix devices safely, and the answer isn't to ban indie repair - it's to ban sabotage.
The FTC also rejects cybersecurity FUD about independent repair: "the record contains no empirical evidence to suggest that independent repair shops are more or less likely than authorized repair shops to compromise or misuse customer data."
As well as arguments that independent repair inflicts "reputational harm" and liability on manufacturers: "Manufacturers provided no empirical evidence to support their concerns about reputational harm or potential liability resulting from faulty third party repairs."
The FTC wants to hear from you if a manufacturer has voided (or threatened to void) your warranty after you got independent repair. This is illegal.
&lt;a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/"&gt;https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/&lt;/a&gt;
They're also proposing new regulations to ban manufacturers' repair sabotage on the grounds that it represents unfair competition. The Commission's goal is now "[to ensure] consumers have choices when they need to repair products that they purchase and own."

&lt;h1&gt;Solving the Moderator's Trilemma with Federation (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/04/pick-all-three/#agonism"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The classic trilemma goes: "Fast, cheap or good, pick any two." The Moderator's Trilemma goes, "Large, diverse userbase; centralized platforms; don't anger users - pick any two." The Moderator's Trilemma is introduced in "Moderating the Fediverse: Content Moderation on Distributed Social Media," a superb paper from Alan Rozenshtein of U of Minnesota Law, forthcoming in the journal &lt;em&gt;Free Speech Law&lt;/em&gt;, available as a prepub on SSRN:
&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4213674#maincontent"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4213674#maincontent&lt;/a&gt;
Rozenshtein proposes a solution (of sorts) to the Moderator's Trilemma: federation. De-siloing social media, breaking it out of centralized walled gardens and recomposing it as a bunch of small servers run by a diversity of operators with a diversity of content moderation approaches. The Fediverse, in other words.
In Albert Hirschman's classic treatise &lt;em&gt;Exit, Voice, and Loyalty,&lt;/em&gt; stakeholders in an institution who are dissatisfied with its direction have two choices: voice (arguing for changes) or exit (going elsewhere). Rozenshtein argues that Fediverse users (especially users of Mastodon, the most popular part of the Fediverse) have more voice &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more "freedom of exit":
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty&lt;/a&gt;
Large platforms - think Twitter, Facebook, etc - are very unresponsive to users. Most famously, Facebook polled its users on whether they wanted to be spied on. Faced with overwhelming opposition to commercial surveillance, Facebook ignored the poll result and cranked the surveillance dial up to a million:
&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-ignores-minimal-user-vote-adopts-new-privacy-policy-flna1c7559683"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-ignores-minimal-user-vote-adopts-new-privacy-policy-flna1c7559683&lt;/a&gt;
A decade later, Musk performed the same stunt, asking users whether they wanted him to fuck all the way off from the company, then ignored the vox populi, which, in this instance, was not vox Dei:
&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-business-8dac8ae023444ef9c37ca1d8fe1c14df"&gt;https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-business-8dac8ae023444ef9c37ca1d8fe1c14df&lt;/a&gt;
Facebook, Twitter and other walled gardens are designed to be sticky-traps, relying on high switching costs to keep users locked within their garden walls which are really prison walls. Internal memos from the companies reveal that this strategy is deliberate, designed to keep users from defecting even as the service degrades:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs&lt;/a&gt;
By contrast, the Fediverse is designed for ease of exit. With one click, users can export the list of the accounts they follow, block and mute, as well as the accounts that follow &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. With one more click, users can import that data into any other Fediverse server and be back up and running with almost no cost or hassle:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/&lt;/a&gt;
Last month, "Nathan," the volunteer operator of mastodon.lol, announced that he was pulling the plug on the server because he was sick of his users' arguments about the new Harry Potter game. Many commentators pointed to this as a mark against federated social media, "You can't rely on random, thin-skinned volunteer sysops for your online social life!"
&lt;a href="https://mastodon.lol/@nathan/109836633022272265"&gt;https://mastodon.lol/@nathan/109836633022272265&lt;/a&gt;
But the mastodon.lol saga demonstrates the &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; of federated social media, not its weakness. After all, 450 million Twitter users are also at the mercy of a thin-skinned sysop - but when he enshittifies his platform, they can't just export their data and re-establish their social lives elsewhere in two clicks:
Mastodon.lol shows us how, if you don't like your host's content moderation policies, you can exercise voice - even to the extent of making him so upset that he shuts off his server - and where voice fails, exit steps in to fill the gap, providing a soft landing for users who find the moderation policies untenable:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6&lt;/a&gt;
Traditionally, centralization has been posed as beneficial to content moderation. As Rozenshtein writes, there's a received wisdom that a company that can "enclose" its users and lock them in has an incentive to invest in better user experience, while companies whose users can easily migrate to rivals are less invested in those users.
And centralized platforms are more nimble. The operators of centralized systems can add hundreds of knobs and sliders to their back end and twiddle them at will. They act unilaterally, without having to convince other members of a federation to back their changes.
Centralized platforms claim that their most powerful benefit to users is extensive content moderation. As Tarleton Gillespie writes, “Moderation is central to what platforms do, not peripheral... [it] is, in many ways, the commodity that platforms offer":
&lt;a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300261431/custodians-of-the-internet/"&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300261431/custodians-of-the-internet/&lt;/a&gt;
Centralized systems claim that their enclosure keeps users safe - from bad code and bad people. Though Rozenshtein doesn't say so, it's important to note that this claim is wildly oversold. Platforms routinely fail at preventing abuse:
&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/sexual-assault-harassment-bullying-trans-students-say-targeted-school-rcna7803"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/sexual-assault-harassment-bullying-trans-students-say-targeted-school-rcna7803&lt;/a&gt;
And they also fail at blocking malicious code:
&lt;a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/threats/apple-bugs-ios-macos_new_class"&gt;https://www.scmagazine.com/news/threats/apple-bugs-ios-macos_new_class&lt;/a&gt;
But even where platforms &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; act to "keep users safe," they fail, thanks to the Moderator's Trilemma. Setting speech standards for millions or even billions of users is an impossible task. Some users will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; feel like speech is being underblocked - while others will feel it's overblocked (and both will be right!):
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/right-or-left-you-should-be-worried-about-big-tech-censorship"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/right-or-left-you-should-be-worried-about-big-tech-censorship&lt;/a&gt;
And platforms play very fast and loose with their definition of "malicious code" - as when Apple blocked OG App, an Instagram ad-blocker that gave you a simple feed consisting of just the posts from the people you followed:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained&lt;/a&gt;
To resolve the Moderator's Trilemma, we need to embrace subsidiarity: "decisions should be made at the lowest organizational level capable of making such decisions."
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/07/full-stack-luddites/#subsidiarity"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/07/full-stack-luddites/#subsidiarity&lt;/a&gt;
For Rozenshtein, "content-moderation subsidiarity devolves decisions to the individual instances that make up the overall network." The fact that users can leave a server and set up somewhere else means that when a user gets pissed off enough about a moderation policy, they don't have to choose between leaving social media or tolerating the policy - they can simply choose another server that's part of the same federation.
Rozenshtein asks whether Reddit is an example of this, because moderators of individual subreddits are given broad latitude to set their own policies and anyone can fork a subreddit into a competing community with different moderation norms. But Reddit's devolution is a matter of &lt;em&gt;policy&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;architecture&lt;/em&gt; - subreddits exist at the sufferance of Reddit's owners (and Reddit is poised to go public, meaning those owners will include activist investors and large institutions that might not care about your little community). You might be happy about Reddit banning /r_TheDonald, but if they can ban that subreddit, they can ban &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; subreddit. Policy &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; well, but &lt;em&gt;fails&lt;/em&gt; badly.
By moving subsidiarity into the technical architecture, rather than human policy, the fediverse can move from &lt;em&gt;antagonism&lt;/em&gt; (the "zero-sum destructiveness" that dominates current online debate) to agonism, where your opponent isn't an enemy - they are a "political adversary":
&lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-administrative-agon"&gt;https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-administrative-agon&lt;/a&gt;
Here, Rozenshtein cites Aymeric Mansoux and Roel Roscam Abbing's "Seven Theses On The Fediverse And The Becoming Of Floss":
&lt;a href="https://test.roelof.info/seven-theses.html"&gt;https://test.roelof.info/seven-theses.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  For this to happen, different ideologies must be allowed to materialize via different channels and platforms. An important prerequisite is that the goal of political consensus must be abandoned and replaced with conflictual consensus...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So your chosen Mastodon server "may have rules that are far more restrictive than those of the major social media platforms." But the whole Fediverse "is substantially more speech protective than are any of the major social media platforms, since no user or content can be permanently banned from the network and anyone is free to start an instance that communicates both with the major Mastodon instances and the peripheral, shunned instances."
A good case-study here is Gab, a Fediverse server by and for far-right cranks, conspiratorialists and white nationalists. Most Fediverse servers have defederated (that is, blocked) Gab, but Gab is still there, and Gab has actually defederated from many of the remaining servers, leaving its users to speak freely - but only to people who want to hear what they have to say.
This is the true meaning of "freedom of speech isn't freedom of reach." Willing listeners aren't blocked from willing speakers - but you don't have the right to be heard by people who don't want to talk to you:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen&lt;/a&gt;
Fediverse servers are (thus far) nonprofits or hobbyist sites, and don't have the same incentives to drive "engagement" to maximize the opportunties to show advertisements. Fediverse applications are frequently designed to be antiviral - that is, to prevent spectacular spreads of information across the system.
It's possible - likely, even - that future Fediverse servers &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be operated by commercial operators seeking to maximize attention in order to maximize revenue - but the users of these servers will still have the freedom of exit that they enjoy on today's Jeffersonian volunteer-run servers - and so commercial servers will have to either curb their worst impulses or lose their users to better systems.
I'll note here that this is a progressive story of the benefits of competition - not the capitalist's fetishization of competition for its own sake, but rather, competition as a means of disciplining capital. It can be readily complimented by discipline through regulation - for example, extending today's burgeoning crop of data-protection laws to require servers to furnish users with exports of their follow/follower data so they can go elsewhere.
There's another dimension to decentralized content moderation that exit and voice &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; address - moderating "harmful" content. Some kinds of harm can be mitigated through exit - if a server tolerates hate speech or harassment, you can go elsewhere, preferably somewhere that blocks your previous server.
But there are other kinds of speech that must not exist - either because they are illegal or because they enact harms that can't be mitigated by going elsewhere (or both). The most spectacular version of this is Child Sex Abuse Material (CSAM), a modern term-of-art to replace the more familiar "child porn."
Rozenshtein says there are "reasons for optimism" when it comes to the Fediverse's ability to police this content, though as he unpacked this idea, I found it much weaker than his other material. Rozenshtein proposes that Fediverse hosts could avail themselves of PhotoDNA, Microsoft's automated scanning tool, to block and purge themselves of CSAM, while noting that this is "hardly foolproof."
If automated scanning fails, Rozenshtein allows that this could cause "greater consolidation" of Mastodon servers to create the economies of scale to pay for more active, human moderation, which he compares to the consolidation of email that arose as a result of the spam-wars. But the spam-wars have been catastrophic for email as a federated system and produced all kinds of opportunities for mischief by the big players:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d&lt;/a&gt;
Rozenshtein: "There is a tradeoff between a vibrant and diverse communication system and the degree of centralized control that would be necessary to ensure 100% filtering of content. The question, as yet unknown, is how stark that tradeoff is."
The situation is much simpler when it comes to servers hosted by moderators who are complicit in illegal conduct: "the Fediverse may live in the cloud, its servers, moderators, and users are physically located in nations whose governments are more than capable of enforcing local law." That is, people who operate "rogue" servers dedicated to facilitating assassination, CSAM, or what-have-you will be arrested, and their servers will be seized.
Fair enough! But of course, this butts up against one of the Fediverse's shortcomings: it isn't particularly useful for promoting illegal speech that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be legal, like the communications of sex workers who were purged from the internet en masse following the passage of SESTA/FOSTA. When sex workers tried to establish a new home in the fediverse on a server called Switter, it was effectively crushed.
This simply reinforces the idea that code is no substitute for law, and while code can interpret bad law as damage and route around it, it can only do so for a short while. The best use of speech-enabling code isn't to avoid the unjust suppression of speech - it's to organize resistance to that injustice, including, if necessary, the replacement of the governments that enacted it:
&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/rubber-hoses-fd685385dcd4"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/rubber-hoses-fd685385dcd4&lt;/a&gt;
Rozenshtein briefly addresses the question of "filter bubbles," and notes that there is compelling research that filter bubbles don't really exist, or at least, aren't as important to our political lives as once thought:
&lt;a href="https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/nor-2021-0002"&gt;https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/nor-2021-0002&lt;/a&gt;
Rozenshtein closes by addressing the role policy can play in encouraging the Fediverse. First, he proposes that governments could host their own servers and use them for official communications, as the EU Commission did following Musk's Twitter takeover:
&lt;a href="https://social.network.europa.eu"&gt;https://social.network.europa.eu&lt;/a&gt;
He endorses interoperability mandates which would required dominant platforms to connect to the fediverse (facilitating their users' departure), like the ones in the EU's DSA and DMA, and proposed in US legislation like the ACCESS Act:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/04/eu-digital-markets-acts-interoperability-rule-addresses-important-need-raises"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/04/eu-digital-markets-acts-interoperability-rule-addresses-important-need-raises&lt;/a&gt;
To get a sense of how that would work, check out "Interoperable Facebook," a video and essay I put together with EFF to act as a kind of "design fiction," in the form of a user manual for a federated, interoperable Facebook:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/interoperablefacebook"&gt;https://www.eff.org/interoperablefacebook&lt;/a&gt;
He points out that this kind of mandatory interop is a preferable alternative to the unconstitutional (and unworkable!) speech bans proposed by Florida and Texas, which limit the ability of platforms to moderate speech. Indeed, this is an either-or proposition - under the terms proposed by Florida and Texas, the Fediverse &lt;em&gt;couldn't&lt;/em&gt; operate.
This is likewise true of proposals to eliminate Section 230, the law that immunizes platforms from federal liability for most criminal speech acts committed by their users. While this law is incorrectly smeared as a gift to Big Tech, it is most needed by small services that can't possibly afford to monitor everything their users say:
&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/06/23/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act/"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/2020/06/23/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act/&lt;/a&gt;
One more recommendation from Rozenshtein: treat interop mandates as an alternative (or adjunct) to antitrust enforcement. Competition agencies could weigh interoperability with the Fediverse by big platforms to determine whether to enforce against them, and enforcement orders could include mandates to interoperate with the Fediverse. This is a much faster remedy than break-ups, which Rozenshtein is dubious of because they are "legally risky" and "controversial."
To this, I'd add that even for people who would welcome break-ups (like me!) they are &lt;em&gt;sloooow&lt;/em&gt;. The breakup of AT&amp;amp;T took &lt;em&gt;69 years&lt;/em&gt;. By contrast, interop remedies would give relief to users &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;:

&lt;h1&gt;Solving the Moderator's Trilemma with Federation (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/04/pick-all-three/#agonism"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The classic trilemma goes: "Fast, cheap or good, pick any two." The Moderator's Trilemma goes, "Large, diverse userbase; centralized platforms; don't anger users - pick any two." The Moderator's Trilemma is introduced in "Moderating the Fediverse: Content Moderation on Distributed Social Media," a superb paper from Alan Rozenshtein of U of Minnesota Law, forthcoming in the journal &lt;em&gt;Free Speech Law&lt;/em&gt;, available as a prepub on SSRN:
&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4213674#maincontent"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4213674#maincontent&lt;/a&gt;
Rozenshtein proposes a solution (of sorts) to the Moderator's Trilemma: federation. De-siloing social media, breaking it out of centralized walled gardens and recomposing it as a bunch of small servers run by a diversity of operators with a diversity of content moderation approaches. The Fediverse, in other words.
In Albert Hirschman's classic treatise &lt;em&gt;Exit, Voice, and Loyalty,&lt;/em&gt; stakeholders in an institution who are dissatisfied with its direction have two choices: voice (arguing for changes) or exit (going elsewhere). Rozenshtein argues that Fediverse users (especially users of Mastodon, the most popular part of the Fediverse) have more voice &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more "freedom of exit":
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty&lt;/a&gt;
Large platforms - think Twitter, Facebook, etc - are very unresponsive to users. Most famously, Facebook polled its users on whether they wanted to be spied on. Faced with overwhelming opposition to commercial surveillance, Facebook ignored the poll result and cranked the surveillance dial up to a million:
&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-ignores-minimal-user-vote-adopts-new-privacy-policy-flna1c7559683"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-ignores-minimal-user-vote-adopts-new-privacy-policy-flna1c7559683&lt;/a&gt;
A decade later, Musk performed the same stunt, asking users whether they wanted him to fuck all the way off from the company, then ignored the vox populi, which, in this instance, was not vox Dei:
&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-business-8dac8ae023444ef9c37ca1d8fe1c14df"&gt;https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-business-8dac8ae023444ef9c37ca1d8fe1c14df&lt;/a&gt;
Facebook, Twitter and other walled gardens are designed to be sticky-traps, relying on high switching costs to keep users locked within their garden walls which are really prison walls. Internal memos from the companies reveal that this strategy is deliberate, designed to keep users from defecting even as the service degrades:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs&lt;/a&gt;
By contrast, the Fediverse is designed for ease of exit. With one click, users can export the list of the accounts they follow, block and mute, as well as the accounts that follow &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. With one more click, users can import that data into any other Fediverse server and be back up and running with almost no cost or hassle:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/&lt;/a&gt;
Last month, "Nathan," the volunteer operator of mastodon.lol, announced that he was pulling the plug on the server because he was sick of his users' arguments about the new Harry Potter game. Many commentators pointed to this as a mark against federated social media, "You can't rely on random, thin-skinned volunteer sysops for your online social life!"
&lt;a href="https://mastodon.lol/@nathan/109836633022272265"&gt;https://mastodon.lol/@nathan/109836633022272265&lt;/a&gt;
But the mastodon.lol saga demonstrates the &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; of federated social media, not its weakness. After all, 450 million Twitter users are also at the mercy of a thin-skinned sysop - but when he enshittifies his platform, they can't just export their data and re-establish their social lives elsewhere in two clicks:
Mastodon.lol shows us how, if you don't like your host's content moderation policies, you can exercise voice - even to the extent of making him so upset that he shuts off his server - and where voice fails, exit steps in to fill the gap, providing a soft landing for users who find the moderation policies untenable:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6&lt;/a&gt;
Traditionally, centralization has been posed as beneficial to content moderation. As Rozenshtein writes, a company that can "enclose" its users and lock them in has an incentive to invest in better user experience, while companies whose users can easily migrate to rivals are less invested in those users.
And centralized platforms are more nimble. The operators of centralized systems can add hundreds of knobs and sliders to their back end and twiddle them at will. They act unilaterally, without having to convince other members of a federation to back their changes.
Centralized platforms claim that their most powerful benefit to users is extensive content moderation. As Tarleton Gillespie writes, “Moderation is central to what platforms do, not peripheral... [it] is, in many ways, the commodity that platforms offer":
&lt;a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300261431/custodians-of-the-internet/"&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300261431/custodians-of-the-internet/&lt;/a&gt;
Centralized systems claim that their enclosure keeps users safe - from bad code and bad people. Though Rozenshtein doesn't say so, it's important to note that this claim is wildly oversold. Platforms routinely fail at preventing abuse:
&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/sexual-assault-harassment-bullying-trans-students-say-targeted-school-rcna7803"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/sexual-assault-harassment-bullying-trans-students-say-targeted-school-rcna7803&lt;/a&gt;
And they also fail at blocking malicious code:
&lt;a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/threats/apple-bugs-ios-macos_new_class"&gt;https://www.scmagazine.com/news/threats/apple-bugs-ios-macos_new_class&lt;/a&gt;
But even where platforms &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; act to "keep users safe," they fail, thanks to the Moderator's Trilemma. Setting speech standards for millions or even billions of users is an impossible task. Some users will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; feel like speech is being underblocked - while others will feel it's overblocked (and both will be right!):
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/right-or-left-you-should-be-worried-about-big-tech-censorship"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/right-or-left-you-should-be-worried-about-big-tech-censorship&lt;/a&gt;
And platforms play very fast and loose with their definition of "malicious code" - as when Apple blocked OG App, an Instagram ad-blocker that gave you a simple feed consisting of just the posts from the people you followed:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained&lt;/a&gt;
To resolve the Moderator's Trilemma, we need to embrace subsidiarity: "decisions should be made at the lowest organizational level capable of making such decisions."
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/07/full-stack-luddites/#subsidiarity"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/07/full-stack-luddites/#subsidiarity&lt;/a&gt;
For Rozenshtein, "content-moderation subsidiarity devolves decisions to the individual instances that make up the overall network." The fact that users can leave a server and set up somewhere else means that when a user gets pissed off enough about a moderation policy, they don't have to choose between leaving social media or tolerating the policy - they can simply choose another server that's part of the same federation.
Rozenshtein asks whether Reddit is an example of this, because moderators of individual subreddits are given broad latitude to set their own policies and anyone can fork a subreddit into a competing community with different modeations norms. But Reddit's devolution is a matter of &lt;em&gt;policy&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;architecture&lt;/em&gt; - subreddits exist at the sufferance of Reddit's owners (and Reddit is poised to go public, meaning those owners will include activist investors and large institutions that might not care about your little community). You might be happy about Reddit banning /r_TheDonald, but if they can band that subreddit, they can ban &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; subreddit. Policy works well, but fails badly.
By moving subsidiarity into technical architecture, rather than human policy, the fediverse can move from &lt;em&gt;antagonism&lt;/em&gt; (the "zero-sum destructiveness" that dominates current online debate) to agonism, where your opponent isn't an enemy - they are a "political adversary":

Here, Rozenshtein cites Aymeric Mansoux and Roel Roscam Abbing's "Seven Theses On The Fediverse And The Becoming Of Floss":
&lt;a href="https://test.roelof.info/seven-theses.html"&gt;https://test.roelof.info/seven-theses.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  For this to happen, different ideologies must be allowed to materialize via different channels and platforms. An important prerequisite is that the goal of political consensus must be abandoned and replaced with conflictual consensus...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So your chosen Mastodon server "may have rules that are far more restrictive than those of the major social media platforms." But the whole Fediverse "is substantially more speech protective than are any of the major social media platforms, since no user or content can be permanently banned from the network and anyone is free to start an instance that communicates both with the major Mastodon instances and the peripheral, shunned instances."
A good case-study here is Gab, a Fediverse server by and for far-right cranks, conspiratorialists and white nationalists. Most Fediverse servers have defederated (that is, blocked) Gab, but Gab is still there, and Gab has actually defederated from many of the remaining servers, leaving its users to speak freely - but only to people who want to hear what they have to say.
This is true meaning of "freedom of speech isn't freedom of reach." Willing listeners aren't blocked from willing speakers - but you don't have the right to be heard by people who don't want to talk to you:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen&lt;/a&gt;
Fediverse servers are (thus far) nonprofits or hobbyist sites, and don't have the same incentives to drive "engagement" to maximize the opportunties to show advertisements. Fediverse applications are frequently designed to be antiviral - that is, to prevent spectacular spreads of information across the system.
It's possible - likely, even - that future Fediverse servers &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be operated by commercial operators seeking to maximize attention in order to maximize revenue - but the users of these servers will still have the freedom of exit that they enjoy on today's Jeffersonian volunteer-run servers - and so commercial servers will have to either curb their worst impulses or lose their users to better systems.
I'll note here that this is a progressive story of the benefits of competition - not the capitalist's fetishization of competition for its own sake, but rather, competition as a means of disciplining capital. It can be readily complimented by discipline through regulation - for example, extending today's burgeoning crop of data-protection laws to require servers to furnish users with exports of their follow/follower data so they can go elsewhere.
There's another dimension to decentralized content moderation that exit and voice &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; address - moderating "harmful" content. Some kinds of harm can be mitigated through exit - if a server tolerates hate speech or harassment, you can go elsewhere, preferably somewhere that blocks your previous server.
But there are other kinds of speech that must not exist - either because they are illegal or because they enact harms that can't be mitigated by going elsewhere (or both). The most spectacular version of this is Child Sex Abuse Material (CSAM), a modern term-of-art to replace the more familiar "child porn."
Rozenshtein says there are "reasons for optimism" when it comes to the Fediverse's ability to police this content, though as he unpacked this idea, I found it much weaker than his other material. Rozenshtein proposes that Fediverse hosts could avail themselves of PhotoDNA, Microsoft's automated scanning tool, to block and purge themselves of CSAM, while noting that this is "hardly foolproof."
If automated scanning fails, Rozenshtein allows that this could cause "greater consolidation" of Mastodon servers to create the economies of scale to pay for more active, human moderation, which he compares to the consolidation of email that arose as a result of the spam-wars. But the spam-wars have been catastrophic for email as a federated system and produced all kinds of opportunities for mischief by the big players:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/dead-letters-73924aa19f9d&lt;/a&gt;
Rozenshtein: "There is a tradeoff between a vibrant and diverse communication system and the degree of centralized control that would be necessary to ensure 100% filtering of content. The question, as yet unknown, is how stark that tradeoff is."
The situation is much simpler when it comes to servers hosted by moderators who are complicit in illegal conduct: "the Fediverse may live in the cloud, its servers, moderators, and users are physically located in nations whose governments are more than capable of enforcing local law." That is, people who operate "rogue" servers dedicated to facilitating assassination, CSAM, or what-have-you will be arrested, and their servers will be seized.
Fair enough! But of course, this butts up against one of the Fediverse's shortcomings: it isn't particularly useful for promoting illegal speech that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be legal, like the communications of sex workers who were purged from the internet en masse following the passage of SESTA/FOSTA. When sex workers tried to establish a new home in the fediverse on a server called Switter, it was effectively crushed.
This simply reinforces the idea that code is no substitute for law, and while code can interpret bad law as damage and route around it, it can only do so for a short while. The best use of speech-enabling code isn't to avoid the unjust suppression of speech - it's to organize resistance to that injustice, including, if necessary, the replacement of the governments that enacted it:
&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/rubber-hoses-fd685385dcd4"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/rubber-hoses-fd685385dcd4&lt;/a&gt;
Rozenshtein briefly addresses the question of "filter bubbles," and notes that there is compelling research that filter bubbles don't really exist, or at least, aren't as important to our political lives as once thought:
&lt;a href="https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/nor-2021-0002"&gt;https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/nor-2021-0002&lt;/a&gt;
Rozenshtein closes by addressing the role policy can play in encouraging the Fediverse. First, he proposes that governments could host their own servers and use them for official communications, as the EU Commission did following Musk's Twitter takeover:
&lt;a href="https://social.network.europa.eu"&gt;https://social.network.europa.eu&lt;/a&gt;
He endorses interoperability mandates which would required dominant platforms to connect to the fediverse (facilitating their users' departure), like the ones in the EU's DSA and DMA, and proposed in US legislation like the ACCESS Act:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/04/eu-digital-markets-acts-interoperability-rule-addresses-important-need-raises"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/04/eu-digital-markets-acts-interoperability-rule-addresses-important-need-raises&lt;/a&gt;
To get a sense of how that would work, check out "Interoperable Facebook," a video and essay I put together with EFF to act as a kind of "design fiction," in the form of a user manual for a federated, interoperable Facebook:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/interoperablefacebook"&gt;https://www.eff.org/interoperablefacebook&lt;/a&gt;
He points out that this kind of mandatory interop is a preferable alternative to the unconstitutional (and unworkable!) speech bans proposed by Florida and Texas, which limit the ability of platforms to moderate speech. Indeed, this is an either-or proposition - under the terms proposed by Florida and Texas, the Fediverse &lt;em&gt;couldn't&lt;/em&gt; operate.
This is likewise true of proposals to eliminate Section 230, the law that immunizes platforms from federal liability for most criminal speech acts committed by their users. While this law is incorrectly smeared as a gift to Big Tech, it is most needed by small services that can't possibly afford to monitor everything their users say:
&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/06/23/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act/"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/2020/06/23/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act/&lt;/a&gt;
One more recommendation from Rozenshtein: treat interop mandates as an alternative (or adjunct) to antitrust enforcement. Competition agencies could weigh interoperability with the Fediverse by big platforms to determine whether to enforce against them, and enforcement orders could include mandates to interoperate with the Fediverse. This is a much faster remedy than break-ups, which Rozenshtein is dubious of because they are "legally risky" and "controversial."
To this, I'd add that even for people who would welcome break-ups (like me!) they are &lt;em&gt;sloooow&lt;/em&gt;. The breakup of AT&amp;amp;T took &lt;em&gt;69 years&lt;/em&gt;. By contrast, interop remedies would give relief to users &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;:

&lt;h1&gt;How to leak a Zoom meeting (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/18/peak-indifference/#watermarks"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
With the world in lockdown, most "white-collar" crime (AKA "world-destroying corruption and looting") now takes place over Zoom. If you witness such a crime, you might be tempted to record the meeting and leak it to a journalist.
But leaking Zoom recordings is seriously fraught because they are full of personally identifying details. Some of these are "traitor-tracing" mechanisms, others are intrinsic to Zoom, and still others come from your end of the recording.
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/leak-zoom-meeting/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/leak-zoom-meeting/&lt;/a&gt;
Nikita Mazurov's guide to anonymizing Zoom videos for The Intercept tackles each of these classes of identifiers.
Traitor-tracing: Zoom meeting hosts have the option to add visual and audio watermarks to their videos.
The visual ones are perceptible - displaying your name/email on the screen so that it will be present in any video-grab - but the audio watermarks are a series of ultrasound chirps with unique identifiers in them.
It's not clear where the audio watermark is inserted; Marzurov hypothesizes that the ultrasonic watermarks are inserted by your copy of the Zoom client, so using an external recording tool might bypass them.
Another important identifier in Zoom recordings is the arrangement of the other participants; this is different for every viewer.
Any recording will reveal information that could identify the leaker: not just the user's OS, but also pop-up alerts about emails and messages.
Source protection with Zoom captures is really hard - but that's all the more reason for this discussion to take place in earnest.

&lt;h1&gt;Pandemics and peak indifference (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/18/peak-indifference/#peak-indifference"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
When I think about our historical, profound shifts in attitude and discourse, the model I apply is "peak indifference."
Say you have real, existential problem. More often than not, these are systemic problems, and those are the hardest problems.
&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2016/07/cory-doctorow-peak-indifference/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2016/07/cory-doctorow-peak-indifference/&lt;/a&gt;
Not just because systemic problems involve collective action (you can't recycle your way out of climate change), but because the cause-and-effect relationships of systemic problems can't be easily known, so it's hard to know what you need to do to avert the problem.
Systemic problems pose a third difficulty: they enrich small minorities, and those minorities can exploit causal ambiguity to deliberately sow doubt.
To make that more concrete: think about cancer-tobacco denial.
Not everyone who smokes gets cancer. When it does give you cancer, the tumor comes years after the puff that damages your genes. There's lots of social pressure to smoke, and getting your friends to quit is even harder than quitting yourself.
And on top of all of it, the tobacco industry made tons of money from giving us cancer, and they could use some of that to fund doubt-merchants who deliberately worsened the difficulty in linking smoking and cancer.
&lt;a href="https://timharford.com/2015/04/cigarettes-damn-cigarettes-and-statistics/"&gt;https://timharford.com/2015/04/cigarettes-damn-cigarettes-and-statistics/&lt;/a&gt;
But denial doesn't make problems disappear - it just incurs policy debt, and the interest on that debt is human suffering. Climate inaction, tobacco inaction, and inequality inaction only delay the day of reckoning, and make it worse when it arrives.
That's where peak denial comes in. Over time, the mounting harms from policy debt make it harder and harder to deny the problem, At a certain point - long before we take action - the number of people who deny the problem starts to decline.
This happens naturally, without any need for activist urging. The problem is that the natural peak denial point is often several steps beyond the point of no return. And that's when denial slides into nihilism:
Here's what nihilism looks like:
"Well, I guess these things &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; give me stage 4 lung cancer after all. No point in quitting now."
or
"You were right, rhino populations are in danger! But since there's only one left, let's find out what he tastes like?"
That's why we can't wait for peak denial to arise on its own, why we must hasten its arrival - because we want people to engage with systemic problems &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the point of no return.
That's where storytelling comes in.
Stories are a fuggly hack, an illusion played on our empathy, wherein we're fooled into caring about the literally inconsequential fate of made-up people (your breakfast yogurt's death was more tragic than Romeo and Juliet's, for it was once alive).
&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2014/11/cory-doctorow-stories-are-a-fuggly-hack/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2014/11/cory-doctorow-stories-are-a-fuggly-hack/&lt;/a&gt;
But still, made up stories that make vivid and visceral the consequences of inaction can spur us into action, can create a vocabulary for discussing the lived experience of people in a future that has not yet arrived.
Even better than stories, though, are &lt;em&gt;histories&lt;/em&gt;, the real stories of real people who really suffered through real experiences comparable to those that we face on our horizon. Hence "those who forget history are doomed to repeat it."
We're very good at forgetting history. The arrival of the covid pandemic was filled with stories of the dimly remembered 1918 influenza pandemic. Our failure to heed those warnings triggered tales of its brutal second wave the following winter.
Herp derp.
Starting in 1968, successive US presidents began to dismantle Glass-Steigel, a corrective put in place after a horrendous finance sector collapse that triggered the Great Depression and WWII. Not one president heeded historians' warnings about the consequences.
Derp.
Dismantling the checks on finance led to successive, worsening crises followed by crushing austerity a deepening inequality. Historical warnings about how this cycle ends with guillotines and Reichstag fires were ignored.
Derp derp derp.
The ideology of finance is a subset of right-wing thought, defined by Corey Robin (in "The Reactionary Mind") as the belief that some people are born to rule, while the rest are born to be ruled over.
&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001"&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001&lt;/a&gt;
This belief has many guises (Dominionism, imperialism, racism, monarchism, fascism, libertarianism) but they all boil down to one thing: eugenics.
It's one thing to believe that markets are meritocratic during a moment of dynamism, when the low-born can rise to riches.
But when their offspring pull up the ladder and social mobility halts, "meritocracy" becomes hereditary: markets elevate the best people, and the best people are all descended from the wealthy, so the wealthy must be of better stock (cue Trump and his talk of "good blood").
Eugenics was once a mainstream American doctrine, and American eugenicists inspired Nazi "race science." But after the Holocaust, eugenics fell into disrepute and we dropped it down the same memory hole that the 1918 flu disappeared into.
But eugenics made a comeback under another guise: the "human capital theory," which holds that markets reward us in proportion to our value to society, and thus the CEO is paid 10,000x more than the janitor because the CEO provides 10,000x more value to the human project.
Eugenics isn't just repugnant, it's also wrong. To understand why, you have to understand how desirable traits are social, not isolated in individuals.
Blair Fix's essay on the link between eugenics and human capitol theory is a must-read:
&lt;a href="https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2021/01/14/the-rise-of-human-capital-theory/"&gt;https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2021/01/14/the-rise-of-human-capital-theory/&lt;/a&gt;
By way of illustration, Fix describes geneticist William Muir's experiments with improving chicken egg-production through artificial selection, in which he only bred the best layers. The result? A disaster. Egg-laying plummeted.
It plummeted because laying isn't an isolated trait. Chickens that produced the most eggs did so by bullying other chickens out of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; feed and resources. Selecting for laying selected for bullying and aggression and led to endless chicken-fights and no eggs.
When Muir bred another flock of chickens based on a &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt;'s ability to lay, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; he got his eggs. Egg-laying is a social process.
This story will be familiar to anyone who's worked in a stack-ranked software development shop.
Software managers have long noted that some coders can turn in 10X or even 100X more code than their median colleagues. But attempts to build "superstar" teams that fired all the median programmers end in chaos and destruction.
If your 100X programmer is such a dick that no one can work with them, then their aptitude is irrelevant - you'll never ship.
I assume there are analogies to this in the sporting world, but I am vastly unqualified to discuss sports of any kind.
Despite the bankruptcy of human capital theory, the systemic dangers it posed, and the obvious fact that it was just eugenics dressed up as economics, the theory festered for decades, poisoning our world.
The C-suites of every major company are filled with hens whose egg-laying prowess is the result of their suppression of their peers' efficacy - while others whose social integration make them far more productive are relegated to worse jobs or forced out altogether.
The lockdown provoked squeals of outrage from the world's wealthiest people, who insisted that the factories be re-opened. As the slogan of the day went, "If a billionaire needs you to go to work to maintain his fortune, then you are the source of that fortune - not him."
We can't afford to be indifferent to any of our systemic problems any more: not climate science, nor inequality, nor monopoly, nor the lurking eugenics that justifies it all.

&lt;h1&gt;Planet Money's free Great Gatsby audiobook (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/18/peak-indifference/#gatsby"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
After the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Act extended copyright by 20 years, putting existing public domain works back into copyright, we endured a two-decade-long public domain drought. That ended in 2018, and since then, each Jan 1 is a new public domain day.
This year's public domain day was a doozy, with a flood of works from the 1925 entering the public domain, including vast swathes of the Harlem Rernaissance and F Scott Fitzgerald's classic Gilded Age/coming-of-age novel The Great Gatsby.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#public-domain-day"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#public-domain-day&lt;/a&gt;
It's only been weeks and yet there have already been a slew of Gatsby remixes: whimsical, serious, trenchant. You'd be hard pressed to find a better fit for our day - a tale of grifting and impending collapse amidst grotesque inequality.
&lt;a href="https://bnet.substack.com/p/the-greater-gatsby"&gt;https://bnet.substack.com/p/the-greater-gatsby&lt;/a&gt;
These remixes are best savored with the taste of the original Gastby still in your mouth. For that, I recommend turning to NPR's Planet Money free reading of the entire novel, with each host reading a chapter.

&lt;h1&gt;Honor MLK day with the Internet Archive (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/18/peak-indifference/#mlk"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
MLK Day isn't just an opportunity to remember Dr King; it's also a moment to contest his legacy - to remember him for who he was, a radical anti-capitalist who believed that racism was a tool first and foremost for class oppression.
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/01/18/martin-luther-king-jr-celebrations-overlook-his-critiques-of-capitalism-and-militarism/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2016/01/18/martin-luther-king-jr-celebrations-overlook-his-critiques-of-capitalism-and-militarism/&lt;/a&gt;
Thankfully, we have a wealth of primary and secondary King material online and open access, especially in the Internet Archive.
Start with 20 minutes' worth of the March on Washington, courtesy of the National Archive.
&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.49737"&gt;https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.49737&lt;/a&gt;

Detroit's Marygrove College shut its doors in 2019, and the contents of its Geschke Library were entrusted to the Internet Archive: 70,000 books and 3,000 journals, many related to King, scanned and online:
&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/marygrovecollege?&amp;amp;amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22King%2C%20Martin%20Luther%2C%20Jr.%2C%201929-1968%22"&gt;https://archive.org/details/marygrovecollege?&amp;amp;amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22King%2C%20Martin%20Luther%2C%20Jr.%2C%201929-1968%22&lt;/a&gt;
The #1000blackgirls campaign produced an extensive reading list for kids, books featuring Black girls as protagonists. The ebooks are available for checkout to anyone who gets a free Internet Archive library card:
&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/1000blackgirlbooks"&gt;https://archive.org/details/1000blackgirlbooks&lt;/a&gt;
The Zora Canon is "a collection of the 100 most prominent books written by African American women," also available for check-out as ebooks from your local library and the Internet Archive's collection.

This wealth of open-access MLK-related material came about as the result of an intense, two-decade struggle over King's words. 15 years ago, you couldn't get "I have a dream" online, but you could hear it in a car commercial.
&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/14/AR2006011400980.html"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/14/AR2006011400980.html&lt;/a&gt;
And even with all this material available for everyone to read, think about, debate and be inspired by, the history of the Civil Rights movement is still only preserved in fragments.
If you have some of those fragments in your possession, the Internet Archive will digitize, preserve and provide access to them for free, forever, for everyone.

Modern copyright began in the late 19th century, when Victor Hugo's advocacy led to the creation of the Berne Convention, a global treaty that is now part of all major trade deals, such as the WTO agreement.
Hugo's legacy has been distorted for ideological purposes - just as King's has been. Today, we are told only that King believed in nonviolence, while his calls for dismantling capitalism are conveniently erased.
And we are likewise told that Hugo concerned himself with how authors' descendants would steer their legacy - but no one mentions that Hugo was intensely suspcious of the actual, biological descendants of authors.
Hugo thought children and grandchildren were not especially well-placed to understand their forebears' significance in history and thought and liable to flog off their inherited exclusive rights to grasping rentiers.
The "descendants" Hugo sought to protect were the ideological descendants of great writers: the people who had been inspired by their ideas and wanted to carry them forward.
King had far more to say than simply deploring violence. He was a towering, radical, revolutionary figure. If we are to defend his legacy, we must start by rejecting the erasure of his political and economic program.
The treasure trove of King's work that we can access today - and every day - are the raw materials for carrying out his legacy and his program: for changing our society into a fundamentally more just, kind and sustainable one.

A note about today's instalment: it features an argument about the relative free speech afforded by internet-based communications versus earlier technologies like phones. The argument isn't just very relevant to today's deplatforming debate, it also has long roots.
That argument is basically a rehash of some intense discussions I had with Manuel Castells when we were both fellows at USC's Annenberg Center, leavened with citations from Howard Rheingold's classic SMART MOBS.

&lt;h1&gt;Facebook's community standards (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/18/peak-indifference/#community-standards"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Amid the calls from all corners for Facebook and other social media giants to do more moderation, let's take a moment to review these companies' manifest unfitness to moderate at all.
Exhibit A: Jamie Zawinkski has a Facebook account with "zero friends, zero posts, zero photos, and has made zero comments in the last 4+ years" (he uses it to manage accounts related to his business, the DNA Lounge).
Facebook just suspended the account for "violating community standards."

&lt;h1&gt;Impossible Music (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/30/deafhood/#impossible-music"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
One of my favorite novel formulas is for the author to take two subjects they're incredibly passionate about and use them as a springboard for their characters' problems and growth.
Sean Williams's &lt;em&gt;Impossible Music&lt;/em&gt; is right in that sweet-spot.
&lt;a href="https://www.impossiblemusic.info/"&gt;https://www.impossiblemusic.info/&lt;/a&gt;
It's the story of Simon Rain, an 18-year-old Australian noise-rock kid whose hearing is permanently, totally wiped out overnight when he suffers a rare stroke that obliterates the brain structures that process sound. That's the curtain-raiser for a superb coming-of-age novel.
It's the tale of Simon's coming to grips with his new Deafness, and how this affects his obsession with the outer bounds of what music is: when noise is musical, when music is noise, and even whether music has to be audible.
Williams himself was a promising and award-winning young composer who never stopped playing and writing, and like many of the musicians of my acquaintance, he can explain experimental music like John Cage's 4:33 in ways that make it sensible, even to musical dumdums like me.
As Simon struggles to convince a famous musicologist that he should be admitted into her elite composition program at a local uni, Williams takes us on a compelling and edifying journey through the meaning of music itself.
Meanwhile, Simon is also coming to grips with being deaf, and deciding whether he is willing to become Deaf - that is, whether he can make his deafness into part of his identity, a fact of life rather than a disability.
He's aided - and hindered - on this journey by the medical specialists, sign teachers and counsellors assigned to him, and by his girlfriend, who he meets in Deaf class after brutal, unstoppable tinnitus renders her unable to hear.
Simon's journey into adulthood, into Deafness, and into a new kind of musicianhood twine around each other, the familiar trappings of teen romance providing a sturdy, easily grasped scaffold for some deep, philosophical nerding out about two seemingly contradictory subjects.
It's a book that's hard to finish with a dry eye, but it's also a book that'll have you thinking about communications, music, Deafness and accommodation in new ways.

&lt;h1&gt;Yanis Varoufakis on capitalism's self-destruction (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/30/deafhood/#diagnosis-cure"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Here's an admirably compact diagnosis of the malady afflicting capitalism and a suggestion for a cure from Yanis Varoufakis:
&lt;a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/06/yanis-varoufakis-interview-with-lea-el-azzi-on-capitalism-after-the-pandemic-europe-greece-lebanon-the-imf.html"&gt;https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/06/yanis-varoufakis-interview-with-lea-el-azzi-on-capitalism-after-the-pandemic-europe-greece-lebanon-the-imf.html&lt;/a&gt;
In 2008, we had an "endogenous" crash, caused by the finance sector itself. Governments gave them trillions, but "this liquidity did not turn into actual investment in the real economy."
"Banks recovered, the oligarchy found themselves with appreciating assets, the majority our there had to face harsh austerity. This boosted the disconnect between the world of money (that was doing well) and the world of the real economy (which was not)."
Now we face an "exogenous" crash, caused by the pandemic, but, "when Covid-19 arrived on the scene, it acted like a pin that bursts a gigantic bubble. Reflating this bubble, in the absence of public investment, will not be possible however much money Central Banks pump in."
All this is by design. Capitalism is supposed to produce technologies that undermines capitalism itself: "new machines come into play that cut down the content of labour per unit of output. New jobs are created lower down the hierarchy of work. This means that machines play an increasing role in producing great new products which the machines will never want and which humans are decreasingly able to afford."
Capitalism defenders argue that average standards of living has been improving for 150+ years. But income increase is a bad proxy for standard of living improvement, and actual living standard increases (as in China) are largely attributable to public investment, not markets.
Meanwhile, capitalism's banker-socialism and worker austerity " led to discontent, which then breeds fascism, xenophobia, nativism, ultra-nationalism."
Varoufakis is cofounder of a movement called Progressive Internatioanl,  which has 2 goals:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Putting together a global plan for shared green prosperity"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Organising global actions in support of local causes (eg a global campaign in support of striking women workers in, say, India)"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;India bans Chinese apps (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/30/deafhood/#cybersovereign"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
India's Ministry of Information Technology has banned 59 Chinese mobile apps, ordering app stores to block them and ISPs to interdict communications with their servers.
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/smartphone-apps-weapon-international-disputes/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/smartphone-apps-weapon-international-disputes/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/tumblr_4f7de4bffc11d7ede15548322ee67c40_f7e81f91_1280.jpg"/&gt;
This follows a fatal "skirmish" between Chinese and Indian troops on the Himalayan border, and while the banned apps are justifiably suspect on privacy grounds, the unilateral ban of major communications channels without due process has human rights campaigners worried.
&lt;img src="https://craphound/images/tumblr_4450d40cd2d981be9f6698504ec27675_d438bf91_640.jpg"/&gt;
In some ways, this kind of ban is inevitable, stemming from the twin monopilistic forces of:
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/tumblr_9dbf24add8fb08b39e9476b24cb54e32_d7a92d02_1280.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Stores: highly centralized repositories of software for the most personal and ubiquitous computing platforms; devices can be configured to ban switching to alternative stores;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concentration in telcoms, which makes it practical to enforce national censorship rules because you need only deputize a handful of giant ISPs to follow the rules you've set down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/tumblr_da6a19d7af73bc016cd0e15e64d41d72_eb63d92a_1280.jpg"/&gt;
Anywhere these forces are present is at high risk of this kind of unilateral censorship.
Included in the ban are some of the most popular apps in India, and Indian audiences are crucial to those apps' success. For example, India leads the world in Tiktok downloads, and Wechat plays a major part of the country's messaging activity.
Meanwhile, Indian online spaces are filling up with some pretty dank national cyberspace sovereignty memes, as Bruce Sterling documents here:
&lt;a href="https://brucesterling.tumblr.com/post/622355066558595072/memes-erupt-as-india-bans-chinese-smartphone"&gt;https://brucesterling.tumblr.com/post/622355066558595072/memes-erupt-as-india-bans-chinese-smartphone&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Post-Trump trumpism (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/30/deafhood/#long-knives"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
It's hard to predict how the world will look on Nov 3, but if the election were held today, Trump would be &lt;em&gt;slaughtered&lt;/em&gt;.
With that in mind, John Quiggin engages in some shrewd analysis of what the US and global right will do when Trump is trounced.
&lt;a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2020/06/29/trumpism-after-trump/"&gt;https://crookedtimber.org/2020/06/29/trumpism-after-trump/&lt;/a&gt;
Quiggin is sanguine about a peaceful transition between administrations, betting that there won't be enough denial and motivated reasoning either from Trump's base or from party bigwigs to sustain any kind of electoral-fraud/rigged-game attempt to delegitimize the outcome.
Not least because Trump's policies are going to murder people by the tens of thousands in Red State strongholds filled with at-risk elderly veterans, and those same policies mean there is &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; chance of an economic recovery in time for election day.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/28/politics/lincoln-project-trump-coronavirus-deaths-greatest-generation/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/28/politics/lincoln-project-trump-coronavirus-deaths-greatest-generation/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
What will the right do when they are routed?
The big power block will be "hard neoliberals who controlled the party before Trump, attempting to reassert themselves, breaking with Trump’s explicit racism while still trying to keep the Repubs white voting base behind them."
But they will be countered by "more competent Trumpists, in the mould of Viktor Orban, keen to push an ethnonationlist, racist and authoritarian policy program without Trump’s clownish demagoguery."
Globally, a Trump defeat will mean little for dictators in Trump's mold, but it will make some of the right wing of the political class "outside the bounds of legitimate discussion...while others will engage in some quick reinvention."
So look for a battle between "competent Trumpists" and "hard neoliberals," with the neolibs in trouble due to the "massive unpopularity" of "just about everything that is identified with hard neoliberalism."
In particular, it's hard to sell under-40s on finance and trickle-down, because they "never experienced the illusory prosperity of the 1990s, or the crises of the 1970s."
Which means...future dominance of the right by competent Trumpists, I guess?

&lt;h1&gt;Gilead's $3k covid med should sell for $10 (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/30/deafhood/#pandemic-profiteers"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Oh, Gilead. No sooner do you stop demanding corporate welfare to help you price-gouge on a covid drug developed at public expense; then you step in a pile of greedy dogshit again, and insist it tastes great and we should try it!
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/19/shared-microbial-destiny-2/#remdesivir"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/19/shared-microbial-destiny-2/#remdesivir&lt;/a&gt;
At issue: your decision to charge Americans $3,000 for a five-day course of remdesivir, a drug developed with public money that experts say you could profitably sell for $10.
&lt;a href="https://icer-review.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ICER-COVID_Initial_Abstract_05012020-3.pdf"&gt;https://icer-review.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ICER-COVID_Initial_Abstract_05012020-3.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Now, this isn't all your fault. We can (and should) also blame the finance-friendly, pharma-dependent politicians, many of the Democrats, who paved the way for this, as David Sirota reminds us.
&lt;a href="https://sirota.substack.com/p/gilead-is-profiteering-off-a-covid"&gt;https://sirota.substack.com/p/gilead-is-profiteering-off-a-covid&lt;/a&gt;
There's a bipartisan consensus on blocking the reinstatement of a rule that would require pharma companies to charge a fair price for drugs developed at public expense.
&lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&amp;amp;amp;session;=2&amp;amp;amp;vote;=00168"&gt;https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&amp;amp;amp;session;=2&amp;amp;amp;vote;=00168&lt;/a&gt;
In 2016, Obama blocked Democratic Congressional calls to enforce the existing laws against pharma price-gouging.
&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/272065-hhs-rejects-house-dems-request-for-drug-pricing-step"&gt;https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/272065-hhs-rejects-house-dems-request-for-drug-pricing-step&lt;/a&gt;
In 2020, GOP Senators blocked reforms that would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices, something that (incredibly) they are currently prohibited from doing, forced to pay whatever price pharma companies name
&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/477604-drug-price-outrage-threatens-to-be-liability-for-gop"&gt;https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/477604-drug-price-outrage-threatens-to-be-liability-for-gop&lt;/a&gt;
This rare bipartisan unity on transfering public funds to lazy, monopolistic pharma giants is hard to understanding. Maybe its the millions of dollars that pharma companies give to both Republican and Democratic campaigns?
&lt;a href="https://khn.org/news/drugmakers-funnel-millions-to-lawmakers-a-few-dozen-get-100000-plus/"&gt;https://khn.org/news/drugmakers-funnel-millions-to-lawmakers-a-few-dozen-get-100000-plus/&lt;/a&gt;
The result is that Americans - who financed the R&amp;amp;D; for remdesivir - will pay more for it than anyone else in the world.
Your $29m/year CEO Daniel O'Day earned every penny when he published an open letter defending this practice,  on the basis that the US system is unique in the world.
&lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/6/an-open-letter-from-daniel-oday-chairman--ceo-gilead-sciences"&gt;https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/6/an-open-letter-from-daniel-oday-chairman--ceo-gilead-sciences&lt;/a&gt;
He's right! The US system is uniquely broken.
He should know.
He broke it.

&lt;h1&gt;Mayor of Las Vegas says the "free market" will decide what's safe (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/23/riot-baby/#carolyn-goodman"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Reality - especially epidemiology - has a distinct leftist bias, which almost makes you feel sorry for right-wing ideologues like Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, who says that every business in town will get to make up its own rules after she unilaterally lifts quarantine.
She told CNN, "I am not a private owner. That's the competition in this country. The free enterprise and to be able to make sure that what you offer the public meets the needs of the public."
&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/22/politics/las-vegas-mayor-social-distancing-cnntv/index.html"&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/22/politics/las-vegas-mayor-social-distancing-cnntv/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
You can see where she's coming from. Her entire worldview is shaped by the Thatcherite dogma that "there is no such thing as society." The Reaganite cant that "The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."
This only makes sense if you don't believe that humans have shared destiny - that your neighbor's problems are not your problems. Even in the best of times, this is obviously untrue (your neighbor's decision to play loud music at 2AM or to store plutonium in his backyard).
Humans &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; have a shared destiny, including/especially a shared microbial destiny. There's a great Lenny Bruce sketch about this, positing that the basis of society is agreement about where we crap and where we eat.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“So we’ll have to have some rules, that’s how the law starts, out of the facts, let’s see. I’ll tell you what we’ll do, we’ll have a vote: we’ll sleep in Area A, is that cool? OK good. We’ll eat in Area B, good? Good. We’ll throw our crap in Area C.” So everything went along pretty cool, everyone is very happy. One night everybody is sleeping, a guy woke up pow got a face full of crap, and said, “Hey what’s the deal here, I thought we had a rule? Eat. Sleep. And crap. And uh, I was sleeping and I got a face full of crap.” So they said, well, ah, the rule is substantive. That’s, see, that’s what the 14th Amendment is, it regulates the rights, but it doesn’t do anything about it, it just says that’s where it’s at. We’ll have to do something to enforce the provisions, to give it some teeth. Here’s the deal, if anybody throws any crap on us, while we’re sleeping, they get thrown in the craphouse. Agreed? Guy goes, “Well, everybody?” Yeah. “But what about if it’s my mother?” You don’t understand, your mother will be the fact, it has nothing to do with it, it’s just a rule. eat, sleep, and crap, anybody throws any crap on us they get thrown right in the crap house. Your mother doesn’t enter into it, everybody’s mother gets thrown in the craphouse. Priest, Rabbi’s, they all go. Agreed? OK, agreed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2017/08/25/lenny-bruce-berkeley-concert-1965-full-transcript/"&gt;https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2017/08/25/lenny-bruce-berkeley-concert-1965-full-transcript/&lt;/a&gt;
Mayor Goodman's position comes down to this: "We're all in the same swimming pool. This end is the no-pissing-in-the-pool end. That end is the pissing-in-the-pool end. This will all be fine."
The small business that reopens with inadequate measures will not harm only itself and its customer. It will harm everyone who comes into contact with those people.
There's lots more wrong with Goodman's idea: like the fact that, workers rely on governments for protection from employers. There's a buyer's market for labor, so employers can treat workers as disposable, murdering them through inadequate protection and then replacing them.
Or the fact that neither business owners nor customers are qualified to assess the sufficiency of a given plan to re-open. That's like saying, "OK, everyone who wants to fly in an airplane should just inspect it themselves and decide whether it's safe."
The complex technical questions of the modern world cannot be navigated through individual research: you can't individually assess the safety of planes, or building codes, or food prep. You can't know if a slot-machine is fair or gimmicked.
We need impartial expert agencies that conduct truth-seeking exercises to determine the best practices, and then conduct inspections and enforcement on our behalf. Not the "personal responsibility" of becoming an expert in every technical subject we live and die by.
These agencies need to show their work, recuse themselves over conflicts of interest, and hear and act on new information as it becomes available.
They need to use a universally legible &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; that comes to technically legible &lt;em&gt;conclusions&lt;/em&gt;.
That is, they need to govern, as part of a legitimate, responsive state.
The problem of electing people who believe in dismantling government is that they dismantle government.
That works great, but fails badly - I neither want to have to determine whether a barber is safe to visit, nor trust the barber to make that determination. I want a  public health expert to make it, and I want that person to be overseen by a democratic institution.
What's more, if YOU are willing to trust the barber (or yourself) and you get it wrong, you could infect &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. This is not a matter of personal choice and personal responsibility. It is a matter of stubbornly irreducible shared destiny.
I get that this is inconvenient for people who believe that shared destiny is a Communist plot. But, as our friends on the right are fond of reminding us, "reality doesn't care about your feelings."

&lt;h1&gt;Powell's botanically correct flower guy is in trouble (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/23/riot-baby/#give-me-slack"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Arnold Drake World is a treasure of a human being. For years, he's spent his days holding down a table in the cafe at Portland's Powell's Books, folding intricate, gorgeous "botanically correct" flowers out of paper napkins.
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/151972138"&gt;https://vimeo.com/151972138&lt;/a&gt;
Now he's in serious trouble. He's broke and his landlord is about to kick him out of the RV he rents-to-own. The stores he normally sells his art through are closed and many aren't expected to reopen.
&lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/paperflowers101"&gt;https://www.gofundme.com/f/paperflowers101&lt;/a&gt;
He's trying to raise $10K to he won't lose his home. He's currently at $3k. I kicked in $25.
Neoliberalism's signature move is squeezing the slack out of the system. Is there a storehouse of ventilators no one is using right now? Sell 'em off! A cash reserve? Stock buyback!
Is there a neighborhood where people live cheap? Bulldoze it and replace it with luxury flats that no one ever intends to live in,only to use as safe-deposit boxes in the sky.
Ripping slack out of the system doesn't just make the world brittle, it murders the quirky and idiosyncratic things that give the world texture and delight. It's the reason every shopping street in London and NYC (pre-crisis) looked like a looping Flintstones background.
The same 6 shops, over and over again: CVS, Citibank, realtor, 7-11, Chase, Citibank, Walgreens.
Arnold Drake World is one of those treasures that you only get when there's slack in the system, like a bolt of insight that only comes when you down tools and laze in the grass.

&lt;h1&gt;Library of Last Resort (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/23/riot-baby/#twisty-little-passages"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Library of Last Resort is a game from Matt Finch. It starts out as a text adventure but quickly gets delightfully weird, transmogrifying into a game where you help the protagonist escape from the author's control and set them free in the real world.
&lt;a href="https://mattfinch.neocities.org/Roadhouse%20Garden.html"&gt;https://mattfinch.neocities.org/Roadhouse%20Garden.html&lt;/a&gt;
It's a game that turns you into a creator, and then, in turn, becomes a online collaboration. How sweet!

&lt;h1&gt;Manyland (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/23/riot-baby/#manyland"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Manyland is a collaborative online environment that's like a sidescroller married to Second Life, by way of Minecraft. You move around and make stuff - objects, environments, etc - and then other users get to use (or repurpose, or dismantle) them.
&lt;a href="http://manyland.com/"&gt;http://manyland.com/&lt;/a&gt;
It's currently maintained by one person, its creator, Philipp Lenssen, and its users have created 700,000 areas with 5,000,000 items. It's got text chat and a suite of anti-harrassment tools.
It all runs in your browser
It has no "business model" - it's sustained by voluntary contributions from its users (or, if you prefer, the "Mayzens" who are residents of "Manyland").
It's a glorious hodgepodge of environments, objects, themes, stories and communities.

&lt;h1&gt;Riot Baby (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/23/riot-baby/#Tochi-Onyebuchi"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Tochi Onyebuchi's Riot Baby is an incandescent Afrofuturist science fiction novella that is so fleet-of-foot as it sprints from one character and time and setting to another that it's dizzying, whirling the reader through fierce bravery in the face of dystopia that uplifts and enrages simultaneously.
&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250214751"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250214751&lt;/a&gt;
Ella was raised in LA, in a neighborhood where gangbangers do drive-bys and the cops inflict terror with impunity. Ella has a power, one she barely understands, a power that shows her the future, and the future she sees is so often violent and terrifying.
Ella's little brother is Kev, born on the evening of the Rodney King uprising, a "riot baby" who barely remembers being little in California, who thinks of New York City's projects as home.
Ella and Kev live a life of sudden violence and grinding poverty, of overt racism and structural, deep-rooted racism that is, if anything, even worse. As Ella comes into more of her powers -- telekenesis, telepathy, dream-walking, mind-reading -- their lives are marked by the increasing tempo of racism and the rise of white supremcy and the carceral state, broken windows policing and mass incarceration.
Their lives diverge when Kev lands in Riker's Island, with a sentence that stretches to years thanks to the penalties he accrues for his failure to be a model prisoner. Meanwhile, Ella is in the world, traversing its empty spaces, learning to use her powers, visiting Kev in Riker's -- sometimes in the visitor's room, and sometimes in his dreams.
Onyebuchi's deft handling of the characters and the transitions between them -- and the times and places that mark them -- are the kind of thing that makes science fiction such a powerful medium, hearkening back to the action-packed, pulp roots of the genre. Add to that Onyebuchi's vivid characterizations and superb ear for dialog and you've got a book that blazes with rage and glory.

&lt;h1&gt;I'm being inducted into the Canadian SF/F hall of fame (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/31/hall-of-famer/#hall-of-famer"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I just got an email asking if I could be free on August 15 for Canvention, the annual Canadian national science fiction convention, because I am being inducted into the  Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Association's Hall of Fame.
Needless to say, my answer was a &lt;em&gt;very enthusiastic yes&lt;/em&gt;.
CSFFA administers Canada's Aurora Awards and the Hall of Fame, a juried prize that I am &lt;em&gt;unbelievably stonked&lt;/em&gt; to be receiving.
&lt;a href="https://www.whenwordscollide.org/canvention.php"&gt;https://www.whenwordscollide.org/canvention.php&lt;/a&gt;
This year's Canvention is
a) Online
and
b) Free
So if you have a hankering to see me in a deeply ferklempt state trying to express my gratitude, you can certainly do so on the 15th!
The list of previous inductees is pretty fantastic, and includes five of my most important mentors:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judith Merrill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorna Toolis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phyllis Gottleib&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Gibson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spider Robinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

As well as many writers who were extraordinarily kind to me over the years, like Charles de Lint and Elizabeth Vonarburg and Tanya Huff.
It is stellar company to be in - joining some of my lifelong heroes. I could not be happier about this.

&lt;h1&gt;Mexico's copyright vs self-determination and national sovereignty (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/31/hall-of-famer/#necensuraninadados"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I've written extensively about Mexico's new copyright law, which was copypasted straight out of the US's lawbooks without debate or consultation and is a catastrophic blow to human rights.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy&lt;/a&gt;
The law does senseless violence to the free expression rights of Mexican people, enabling both automated and deliberate censorship, as well as making it trivial to dox anyone by claiming copyright violations:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/how-mexicos-new-copyright-law-crushes-free-expression"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/how-mexicos-new-copyright-law-crushes-free-expression&lt;/a&gt;
And its DRM rules are a nightmare for cybersecurity, fencing off devices that Mexicans entrust with their data and personal safety from independent security audits:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-cybersecurity-and-human-rights"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-cybersecurity-and-human-rights&lt;/a&gt;
Today, I published two more articles analyzing the threats the new law poses to human rights in Mexico. The first is "Disability, Education, Repair and Health: How Mexico's Copyright Law Hurts Self-Determination in the Internet Age."
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/disability-education-repair-and-health-how-mexicos-copyright-law-hurts-self"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/disability-education-repair-and-health-how-mexicos-copyright-law-hurts-self&lt;/a&gt;
It explains how Mexico's new law will prevent people with disabilities from adapting their technology without permission from a distant manufacturer who may not care to have their products altered:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/disability-education-repair-and-health-how-mexicos-copyright-law-hurts-self#adaptation"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/disability-education-repair-and-health-how-mexicos-copyright-law-hurts-self#adaptation&lt;/a&gt;
And how it undermines the Right to Repair, by allowing foreign firms to monopolize repairs and unilaterally decide when a product is "beyond repair" and must be replaced, which has major implications for agriculture and public health:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/disability-education-repair-and-health-how-mexicos-copyright-law-hurts-self#r2r"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/disability-education-repair-and-health-how-mexicos-copyright-law-hurts-self#r2r&lt;/a&gt;
And finally, how the rules on takedown, filters and DRM interfere with education, allowing for the arbitrary removal of curricular materials from the net and prohibiting educators from bypassing digital locks to integrate works into their teaching.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/disability-education-repair-and-health-how-mexicos-copyright-law-hurts-self#education"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/disability-education-repair-and-health-how-mexicos-copyright-law-hurts-self#education&lt;/a&gt;
Nominally, the new Mexican law protects these activities, but as I explain, these protections are a fiction - in 22 years, no one in the USA has been able to invoke them, because of all the conditions they impose.
In a second article, "Mexico's New Copyright Law Undermines Mexico's National Sovereignty, Continuing Generations of Unfair 'Fair Trade Deals' Between the USA and Latin America," I connect the new law to generations of economic colonialism.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-undermines-mexicos-national-sovereignty-continuing"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-undermines-mexicos-national-sovereignty-continuing&lt;/a&gt;
Mexico's new copyright law didn't get rushed through Congress in a vacuum: it was passed as part of the USMCA, Donald Trump's replacement for NAFTA.
Like so many trade deal-based laws, this new system doesn't create an even footing between trade partners, but rather imposes a permanent, structural disadvantage on Mexican businesses and the Mexican people.
Under this law, Mexican firms will be bound by terms far more onerous than those of their Canadian and US counterparts, such as automated copyright filters, which cost millions to install and subject Mexicans' communications to censorship from black-box algorithms.
Mexico's new DRM laws do not contain even the minimal (wholly inadequate) safeguards in the US or Canadian systems, nor to do they have the 22 years' worth of exemptions US films can rely on.
Meanwhile, the USA is likely to abandon this law, as we are suing the US government to overturn it:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/green-v-us-department-justice"&gt;https://www.eff.org/cases/green-v-us-department-justice&lt;/a&gt;
Along with the DRM rules, Mexico has brought in a harsh and unremitting "notice and takedown" system tailor-made for abuse, which will allow companies to remove warnings about product defects and dox their critics.
Mexico's Congress didn't rush this law through without public debate because they knew we'd love it and didn't want to spoil the surprise.
Like every dirty trade deal, this was heavily lobbied and passed without scrutiny because its backers knew it couldn't withstand scrutiny.
Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights has until TOMORROW to open an investigation into this law. If they do, they can overturn it. If you are in Mexico or are Mexican, here is a petition you can fill in:

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/exogen.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Self-bricking medical device (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/31/hall-of-famer/#bricked-exogen"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Adam, a reader, wrote to me to say, "My wife just bought a medical-treatment device called Exogen. It's not cheap. It purportedly uses ultrasound to promote bone healing.
"We're both skeptical about it, and all the studies that validate it were paid for by Exogen, but when you've got a persistent health problem, you don't want to leave any stones unturned, and this seems unlikely to be actively harmful."
Speaking as someone with untreatable, degenerative, chronic pain, boy do I understand where he's coming from. And here's what happened:
"Before she paid retail, we thought of buying one off eBay. Surely all the people who have used these in the past would want to unload them and recoup some of their money.
"After reading the manual, we think we know why they weren't for sale: &lt;em&gt;the device bricks itself after 343 uses&lt;/em&gt;--which is slightly longer than the course of treatment her doctor prescribed.
"You can call the company to have it unbricked if your doctor prescribes a longer treatment."
Don't take his word for it. Read the manual.
&lt;a href="https://www.exogen.com/wp-content/uploads/81087030-US-2014-User-Guide.pdf"&gt;https://www.exogen.com/wp-content/uploads/81087030-US-2014-User-Guide.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
This is pure confiscation. Remember, this isn't a product that's offered at a discount for people who opt out of reselling it - it's an expensive med-tech item sold to desperate people with serious maladies.
Imagine if you couldn't resell your car - we're heading there. Textbook monopolies have killed the used textbook market. It's part of an overall program to shift wealth from the public to corporations, and risk from corporations to us.

&lt;h1&gt;Apple's internal Right to Repair fight (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/31/hall-of-famer/#e-waste-apple"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Someone leaked internal Apple email exchanges about Right to Repair to Ifixit; they reveal "internal debate, rife with uncertainty" - employees who have deep misgivings about dooming their work-product to become e-waste.
&lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/43008/apple-emails-reveal-internal-debate-on-right-to-repair"&gt;https://www.ifixit.com/News/43008/apple-emails-reveal-internal-debate-on-right-to-repair&lt;/a&gt;
Of particular interest is the internal debate after Apple (surprisingly) published two excellent service manuals, which an Ifixit writer queried them on, asking if it was intentional.
An Apple spox wrote to the internal PR team: "It’s pretty clear things are happening in a vacuum and there is not an overall strategy...
"Plus, with one hand we are making these changes and the other is actively fighting Right to Repair legislation moving in 20 states without real coordination for how updated policies could be used to leverage our position."
It looks like the service manual release was motivated by a desire to attain EPEAT green certification. As Ifixit points out, "these manuals have been online for a year. Has any harm come from it? Have lawsuits sprung out of the woodwork? We certainly haven’t heard of any."
Apple is publishing "environmental progress reports" that stress the company's commitment to repair and say "reuse is our first choice" - entirely new messages from the company.
As Ifixit points out: "Apple has an opportunity to push—nay, lead—the entire industry in a better direction. Durable, repairable, long-lasting products could be the norm."

&lt;h1&gt;Challenge questions suck (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/31/hall-of-famer/#favorite-food"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
You know that thing that companies do when you set up an online account, asking you to name your favorite food and your high-school mascot as a way to recover your password later, or verify your identity if something sus is going on?
They're called "challenge questions" and they don't work.
That's the conclusion a group of Google security researchers and my EFF colleague Joseph Bonneau reached through a set of careful - and devastating - experiments.
&lt;a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43783.pdf"&gt;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43783.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Not only are the answers to these questions pretty easy for attackers to guess or research (your mother's maiden name is a matter of public record and your favorite food is "pizza"), but actual users really struggle to remember their answers.
Topline findings:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"37% admitted to providing fake answers in an attempt to make them 'harder to guess' although on aggregate this behavior had the opposite effect"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"40% of users were unable to recall their answers when needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Questions that are potentially the most secure (e.g what is your firstphone number) are also the ones with the worst memorability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears next to impossible to find secret questions that are both secure and memorable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I treat these questions as secondary passwords and use password generators to come up with strong, long passwords for them, managing them in a password manager (so much for memorable). Even this has an unexpected failure mode!
My small credit union's site requires you to come up with several of these questions at signup time: favorite movie, high school mascot, etc. You can answer from a list, or you can fill in our own. I did the latter, giving answers like "OWX~kMy!'(T;DkLwmBjrDs."
What I didn't know was that the challenge questions are presented as &lt;em&gt;multiple choice&lt;/em&gt;! So here's how it looks:
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE ANIMAL?
[ ] BIRD
[ ] FISH
[ ] TURTLE
[ ] DOG
[ ] PIG
[ ] RABBIT
[ ] SNAKE
[ ] OWX~kMy!'(T;DkLwmBjrDs
[ ] CAT
[ ] FOX
So much for my high-security, hard-to-guess alternative.

My weird hobby is taking pictures of signs, especially "vernacular" signs, handwritten and odd. The best kinds of signs tell you what &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people think &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are thinking, or what you don't understand. I've nabbed over 4,600 of 'em:
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=37996580417%40N01&amp;amp;amp;sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;amp;text=sign&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=37996580417%40N01&amp;amp;amp;sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;amp;text=sign&amp;amp;amp;view_all=1&lt;/a&gt;
I think you learn more about the world by delving into others' misconceptions than you learn from their factual understandings. Facts are out there for anyone to discover, but when someone inadvertently affords you a glimpse into their wrong beliefs, well, that's something that can't be learned in any other way.
Which brings me to the apologists for Silicon Valley Bank, who are busily churning out incredibly revealing bad takes about why bailing out SVB was the right thing to do, and why you're wrong to call it a bailout, and why all of this is Very Regrettable but nevertheless The Right Thing To Do.
Here's a terrible reason to support the SVB bailout: because if we let all the tech companies who did business with it fail, you might not be able to get into your house anymore after your smart-lock fails because the cloud service it depends on cuts off the startup that made it because their bank account went up in a puff of smoke:
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-fallout/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-fallout/&lt;/a&gt;
Look, if you think the fact that my Internet of Shit door-lock failed because the company that designed it made no plan to let me into my house if they went out of business would make me sympathetic to that company, you are out of your fucking &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt;. If that happened to me, it would make me want to tear the lock out of my door, hunt down the CEO of the company that made it, set the lock on fire, and throw it through their front window.
Here's another terrible reason to support the bailout: if SVB's depositors lose their money, every other large depositor will flock to Morganstanley, on the theory that Morganstanley is too big to fail, and will behave just as recklessly, but will never be allowed to go under precisely because they are so structurally important:
&lt;a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/can-the-svb-crisis-be-solved-in-the-longer-run.html"&gt;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/can-the-svb-crisis-be-solved-in-the-longer-run.html&lt;/a&gt;
I'm pretty sure this is true! It doesn't make me want to support an SVB bailout though - it makes me want to break up Morganstanley, regulate the everlasting shit out of the resulting fragments, and create massive &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; banks that are run by and for their depositors, insulated from the reckless, speculative conduct of these maniacs who keep crashing the world economy:
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-15-federal-reserve-banking-public-option/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-15-federal-reserve-banking-public-option/&lt;/a&gt;
One more very bad reason to support the bailout: "it's not a bailout." The Biden administration wants us to know that SVB's creditors and shareholders aren't being bailout here, just the depositors - everyday folken with more than $250,000 in liquid cash in their checking accounts. Whomst amongst us can't relate to that?
&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/biden-administrations-message-dont-call-bailout-rcna74628"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/biden-administrations-message-dont-call-bailout-rcna74628&lt;/a&gt;
There are a lot of totally normal people who would suffer if not for this bailout - the people who clean the toilets or answer the customer-service calls for tech companies aren't stock-option-fattened bros in Patagoinia vests. They're totally normal working people who took no risks and bear no responsibility for the failure of SVB.
But &lt;em&gt;come on&lt;/em&gt;. Does anyone seriously believe that the absolute fucking &lt;em&gt;ghouls&lt;/em&gt; who came out against a barely-there student debt cancellation as a precursor to &lt;em&gt;literal Stalinist gulags&lt;/em&gt; are advocating for endless billions for SVB's depositors because of the &lt;em&gt;janitors&lt;/em&gt;?
&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/03/12/larry-summers-says-now-is-not-the-time-for-moral-hazard-lectures-about-bailouts/"&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/03/12/larry-summers-says-now-is-not-the-time-for-moral-hazard-lectures-about-bailouts/&lt;/a&gt;
Listen: people aren't pissed off about the bailout because they want startups to fail. They're pissed off because they are living in the century of "socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor":
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/iaqdrl/as_martin_luther_king_jr_said_in_1968_this/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/iaqdrl/as_martin_luther_king_jr_said_in_1968_this/&lt;/a&gt;
They're pissed off because the Treasury official who presided over the theft of millions of houses by corrupt, bailed-out banks after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis and then wrote academic articles defending the decision to "foam the runways" for the banks with everyday Americans' homes is about to join the Federal Reserve Board:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/06/personnel-are-policy/#janice-eberly"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/06/personnel-are-policy/#janice-eberly&lt;/a&gt;
They're pissed off because Biden reneged on his promise for muscular, sweeping student debt cancellation in favor of a self-immolating weaksauce version that would barely dent the crushing financial devastation faced by millions of young people:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/03/utopia-of-rules/#in-triplicate"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/03/utopia-of-rules/#in-triplicate&lt;/a&gt;
Only to have the illegitimate dotards of the Supreme Court make even that symbolic gesture moot:
&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/28/1159606491/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2023/02/28/1159606491/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court&lt;/a&gt;
(As to what Biden should do about it? The same thing Trump would: Pack the court. Pack the fucking court. Pack it. Just do it. The court's legitimacy could not sink any lower. There is no downside. Do it.)
The rage at well-capitalized startups being rescued from unearned distress isn't motivated by a free-floating techlash rage at "bros." It's rage born of the fact that young Americans are being put on the hook for &lt;em&gt;their dead parents' debts&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation&lt;/a&gt;
There is infinite political will and bottomless appetite for money creation when VC-backed companies face distress, but when the death of your parents is followed by years of brutal debt-collector armbreakers chasing you from phone number to phone number, it's just &lt;em&gt;crickets&lt;/em&gt;.
There's no question that the SVB failure resulted from a series of extremely technical phenomena that offer a fascinating peek into the behind-the-scenes forces that power an economy built on private banking and home ownership as the sole means of intergenerational wealth transfer.
But the fact that this is a &lt;em&gt;complicated&lt;/em&gt; circumstance doesn't mean that laypeople don't have a right to be furious about it. We should all be suspicious of the inevitabilist narratives of the "experts" who claim that none of this could have been avoided:
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-15-qa-daniel-davies-venture-capitalist-bailout/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-15-qa-daniel-davies-venture-capitalist-bailout/&lt;/a&gt;
When finance "experts" tell you that you have no business opining on this highly technical matter, just remember that these are the same experts who were paid fantastic gobs of cash to certify that all these failing banks are just &lt;em&gt;groovy&lt;/em&gt;, mere weeks ago:
&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kpmg-faces-scrutiny-for-audits-of-svb-and-signature-bank-42dc49dd"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/kpmg-faces-scrutiny-for-audits-of-svb-and-signature-bank-42dc49dd&lt;/a&gt;
Those same experts were caught bribing government officials to help their top staff &lt;em&gt;cheat&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;em&gt;on ethics exams&lt;/em&gt; (!!!!!!!!!!!!):
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/04/aaronsw/#crooked-ref"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/04/aaronsw/#crooked-ref&lt;/a&gt;
Even if it turns out to be true that the kind of risk that SVB was exposed to is an inevitable consequence of an economy built on private banking and housing as an asset, rather than a human right:
&lt;a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/banking-in-very-uncertain-times/"&gt;https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/banking-in-very-uncertain-times/&lt;/a&gt;
Remember that those choices are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; inevitable. The decision to make housing the primary driver of intergenerational wealth transfer is both recent and very, very stupid:
&lt;a href="https://gen.medium.com/the-rents-too-damned-high-520f958d5ec5"&gt;https://gen.medium.com/the-rents-too-damned-high-520f958d5ec5&lt;/a&gt;
Private banking doesn't need to be an unregulated free-for-all, nor does it have to be the only game in town:
&lt;a href="https://publicbankla.com/"&gt;https://publicbankla.com/&lt;/a&gt;
As SVB's apologists insist that tech startups should be preserved lest our IoT gadgets brick themselves, or  that SVB should be preserved so that the Morganstanley cancer doesn't creep into more of our social organs, or that bailing out SVB is acceptable because it's to defend elite startup founders, not ultrawealthy bank owners, they are &lt;em&gt;missing the fucking point&lt;/em&gt;.
But they're missing it in a useful way. Like any weird sign, these bad takes teach us a lot about how the people who utter them model our own beliefs. They think that people &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; smart gadgets. They think that we don't want the finance sector reformed. They think that we're motivated by schadenfreude, which means that they also think we've forgotten about broken student debt promises, about robosigning and the foreclosure epidemic. They think we are fully onboard with rugged individualism for the poor and socialism for the rich.
These bad takes reveal a &lt;em&gt;profoundly&lt;/em&gt; out-of-touch elite, the spiritual descendants of the French aristos who went to the guillotine with sincerely baffled hearts, unable to imagine why anyone would be this angry at them.
Upton Sinclair said, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it." It's even more difficult to get a one percenter to understand something when the system that insulates them from the endless, spiraling economic wreckage of our new feudal economy is on the line.

&lt;img alt="A man's hand holds a mobile phone. Its screen displays an Instagram ad. The ad has been replaced with a slice of a vintage comic book 'small ads' page." src="https://craphound.com/images/junk-targeted-ads.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Everything advertised on social media is overpriced junk (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/08/late-stage-sea-monkeys/#jeremys-razors"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In "Behavioral Advertising and Consumer Welfare: An Empirical Investigation," a trio of business researchers from Carnegie Mellon and Pamplin College investigate the difference between the goods purchased through highly targeted online ads and just plain web-searches, and conclude social media ads push overpriced junk:
&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4398428"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4398428&lt;/a&gt;
Specifically, stuff that's pushed to you via targeted ads costs an average of 10 percent more, and it significantly more likely to come from a vendor with a poor rating from the Better Business Bureau. This may seem trivial and obvious, but it's got profound implications for media, commercial surveillance, and the future of the internet.
Writing in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, Julia Angwin - a legendary, muckraking data journalist - breaks down those implications. Angwin builds a case study around Jeremy's Razors, a business that advertises itself as a "woke-free" shaving solution for manly men:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/opinion/online-advertising-privacy-data-surveillance-consumer-quality.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/opinion/online-advertising-privacy-data-surveillance-consumer-quality.html&lt;/a&gt;
Jeremy's Razors spends a fucking &lt;em&gt;fortune&lt;/em&gt; on ads. According to Facebook's Ad Library, the company spent $800,000 on FB ads in March, targeting fathers of school-age kids who like Hershey's, ultimate fighting, hunting or Johnny Cash:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/jeremys-targeting"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/jeremys-targeting&lt;/a&gt;
Anti-woke razors are an objectively, hilariously stupid idea, but that's not the point here. The point is that Jeremy's has to spend $800K/month to reach its customers, which means that it either has to accept $800K less in profits, or make it up by charging more and/or skimping on quality.
Targeted advertising is &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; expensive, and incredibly lucrative - for the ad-tech platforms that sit between creative workers and media companies on one side, and audiences on the other. In order to target ads, ad-tech companies have to collect deep, nonconsensual dossiers on every internet user, full of personal, sensitive and potentially compromising information.
The switch to targeted ads was part of the enshittification cycle, whereby companies like Facebook and Google lured in end-users by offering high-quality services - Facebook showed you the things the people you asked to hear from posted, and Google returned the best search results it could find.
Eventually, those users became locked in. Once all our friends were on Facebook, we held each other hostage, each unable to leave because the others were there. Google used its access to the capital markets to snuff out any rival search companies, spending tens of billions every year to be the default on Apple devices, for example.
Once we were locked in, the tech giants made life worse for us in order to make life better for media companies and advertisers. Facebook violated its promise to be the privacy-centric alternative to Myspace, where our data would never be harvested; it switched on mass surveillance and created cheap, accurate ad-targeting:
&lt;a href="https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876?ln=en"&gt;https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876?ln=en&lt;/a&gt;
Google fulfilled the prophecy in its founding technical document, the Pagerank paper: "advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers." They, too, offered cheap, highly targeted ads:
&lt;a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html"&gt;http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html&lt;/a&gt;
Facebook and Google weren't just kind to advertisers - they also gave media companies and creative workers a great deal, funneling vast quantities of traffic to both. Facebook did this by cramming media content into the feeds of people who hadn't asked to see it, displacing the friends' posts they &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; asked to see. Google did it by upranking media posts in search results.
Then we came to the final stage of the enshittification cycle: having hooked both end-users and business customers, Facebook and Google withdrew the surpluses from both groups and handed them to their own shareholders. Advertising costs went up. The share of ad income paid to media companies went down. Users got more ads in their feeds and search results.
Facebook and Google illegally colluded to rig the ad-market with a program called Jedi Blue that let the companies steal from both advertisers and media companies:
&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/google-meta-jedi-blue-eu-uk-antitrust-probes/"&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/google-meta-jedi-blue-eu-uk-antitrust-probes/&lt;/a&gt;
Apple blocked Facebook's surveillance on its mobile devices, but increased its own surveillance of Iphone and Ipad users in order to target ads to them, even when those users explicitly opted out of spying:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar&lt;/a&gt;
Today, we live in the enshittification end-times, red of tooth and claw, where media companies' revenues are dwindling and advertisers' costs are soaring, and the tech giants are raking in hundreds of billions, firing hundreds of thousands of workers, and pissing away tens of billions on stock buybacks:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/mass-tech-worker-layoffs-and-the-soft-landing-1ddbb442e608"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/mass-tech-worker-layoffs-and-the-soft-landing-1ddbb442e608&lt;/a&gt;
As Angwin points out, in the era before behavioral advertising, Jeremy's might have bought an ad in &lt;em&gt;Deer &amp;amp; Deer Hunting&lt;/em&gt; or another magazine that caters to he-man types who don't want woke razors; the same is true for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; products and publications. Before mass, non-consensual surveillance, ads were based on &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;, not on the reader's prior behavior.
There's no reason that ads today couldn't return to that regime. Contextual ads operate without surveillance, using the same "real-time bidding" mechanism to place ads based on the content of the article and some basic parameters about the user (rough location based on IP address, time of day, device type):
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/05/behavioral-v-contextual/#contextual-ads"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/05/behavioral-v-contextual/#contextual-ads&lt;/a&gt;
Context ads perform about as well as behavioral ads - but they have a radically different power-structure. No media company will ever know as much about a given user as an ad-tech giant practicing dragnet surveillance and buying purchase, location and finance data from data-brokers. But no ad-tech giant knows as much about the context and content of an article as the media company that published it.
Context ads are, by definition, centered on the media company or creative worker whose work they appear alongside of. They are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder for tech giants to enshittify, because enshittification requires lock-in and it's hard to lock in a publication who knows better than anyone what they're publishing and what it means.
We should ban surveillance advertising. Period. Companies should not be allowed to collect our data without our meaningful opt-in consent, and if that was the standard, there would be no data-collection:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/22/myob/#adtech-considered-harmful"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/22/myob/#adtech-considered-harmful&lt;/a&gt;
Remember when Apple created an opt &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; button for tracking, more than 94 percent of users clicked it (the people who clicked "yes" to "can Facebook spy on you?" were either Facebook employees, or confused):
&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html"&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html&lt;/a&gt;
Ad-targeting enables a host of evils, like paid political disinformation. It also leads to more expensive, lower-quality goods. "A Raw Deal For Consumers," Sumit Sharma's new &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; paper, catalogs the many other costs imposed on Americans due to the lack of tech regulation:
&lt;a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/A-Raw-Deal-for-US-Consumers_March-2023.pdf"&gt;https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/A-Raw-Deal-for-US-Consumers_March-2023.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Sharma describes the benefits that Europeans will shortly enjoy thanks to the EU's Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, from lower prices to more privacy to more choice, from cloud gaming on mobile devices to competing app stores.
However, both the EU and the US - as well as Canada and Australia - have focused their news industry legislation on misguided "link taxes," where tech giants are required to pay license fees to link to and excerpt the news. This is an approach grounded in the mistaken idea that tech giants are stealing media companies' content - when really, tech giants are stealing their &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/18/news-isnt-secret/#bid-shading"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/18/news-isnt-secret/#bid-shading&lt;/a&gt;
Creating a new pseudocopyright to control who can discuss the news is a terrible idea, one that will make the media companies beholden to the tech giants at a time when we desperately need deep, critical reporting on the tech sector. In Canada, where Bill C-18 is the latest link tax proposal in the running to become law, we're already seeing that conflict of interest come into play.
As Jesse Brown and Paula Simons - a veteran reporter turned senator - discuss on the latest Canadaland podcast, the &lt;em&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/em&gt;'s sharp and well-reported critical series on the tech giants died a swift and unexplained death immediately after the &lt;em&gt;Star&lt;/em&gt; began receiving license fees for tech users' links and excerpts from its reporting:
&lt;a href="https://www.canadaland.com/paula-simons-bill-c-18/"&gt;https://www.canadaland.com/paula-simons-bill-c-18/&lt;/a&gt;
Meanwhile, in Australia, the proposed "news bargaining code" stampeded the tech giants into agreeing to enter into "voluntary" negotiations with the media companies, allowing Rupert Murdoch's Newscorp to claim the lion's share of the money, and then conduct layoffs across its newsrooms.
And in France, the link tax depends on publishers integrating with Google Showcase, a product that makes Google &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; money from news content and makes news publishers &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; dependent on Google:
&lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/french-competition-authority-greenlights-google-pledges-over-paying-news-publishers/"&gt;https://www.politico.eu/article/french-competition-authority-greenlights-google-pledges-over-paying-news-publishers/&lt;/a&gt;
A link tax only pays off for so long as the tech giants remain dominant and continue to extract the massive profits that make them capable of paying the tax. But legislative action to fix the ad-tech markets, like Senator Mike Lee's ad-tech breakup bill (cosponsored by both Ted Cruz &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Elizabeth Warren!) would shift power to publishers, and with it, money:
&lt;a href="https://www.lee.senate.gov/2023/3/the-america-act"&gt;https://www.lee.senate.gov/2023/3/the-america-act&lt;/a&gt;
With ad-tech intermediaries scooping up 50% or more of every advertising dollar, there is plenty of potential to save the news industry without the need for a link tax. If unrigging the ad-tech market drops the platforms' share of advertising dollars to a more reasonable 10%, then the advertisers and publishers could split the remainder, with advertisers spending 20% less and publishers netting 20% &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;.
Passing a federal privacy law would end surveillance advertising at the stroke of a pen, shifting the market to context ads that let publishers, not platforms, call the shots. As an added bonus, the law would stop Tiktok from spying on Americans, and also end Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft's spying to boot:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/30/tik-tok-tow/#good-politics-for-electoral-victories"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/30/tik-tok-tow/#good-politics-for-electoral-victories&lt;/a&gt;
Mandating competition in app stores - as the Europeans are poised to do - would kill Google and Apple's 30% "app store tax" - the percentage they rake off of every transaction from every app on Android and Ios. Drop that down to the 2-5% that the credit cards charge, and every media outlet's revenue-per-subscriber would jump by 25%.
Add to that an end-to-end rule for tech giants requiring them to deliver updates from willing receivers to willing senders, so every newsletter you subscribed to would stay out of your spam folder and every post by every media company or creator you followed would show up in your feed:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen&lt;/a&gt;
That would make it impossible for tech giants to use the sleazy enshittification gambit of forcing creative workers and media companies to pay to "boost" their content (or pay $8/month for a blue tick) just to get it in front of the people who asked to see it:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6&lt;/a&gt;
The point of enshittification is that it's bad for everyone &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; the shareholders of tech monopolists. Jeremy's Razors are bad, winning a 2.7 star rating out of five:
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/JeremysRazors/reviews"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/JeremysRazors/reviews&lt;/a&gt;
The company charges more for these substandard razors, and you are more likely to find out about them, because of targeted, behavioral ads. These ads starve media companies and creative workers and make social media and search results &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt;.
A link tax is predicated on the idea that we need Big Tech to stay big, and to dribble a few crumbs for media companies, compromising their ability to report on their deep-pocketed beneficiaries, in a way that advantages the biggest media companies and leaves small, local and independent press in the cold.
By contrast, a privacy law, ad-tech breakups, app-store competition and end-to-end delivery would shatter the power of Big Tech and shift power to users, creative workers and media companies. These are solutions that don't just keep working if Big Tech goes away - they actually hasten that demise! What's more, they work just as well for big companies as they do for independents.
Whether you're the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; or you're an ex-&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter who's quit your job and now crowdfunds to cover your local school board and town council meetings, shifting &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;share of income&lt;/em&gt; will benefit you, whether or not Big Tech is still in the picture.

Personnel are policy, something that the Biden administration has proved again and again since the 2020 election. Biden himself is a kind of empty vessel into which different wings of the Democratic party pour their will, yielding a strange brew of appointments both great and terrible.
On the one hand, you have progressive appointments like Jonathan Kanter at the DoJ and Lina Khan at the FTC, leaders who are determined to challenge and curb corporate power:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/10/see-you-in-the-funny-papers/#bidens-legacy"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/10/see-you-in-the-funny-papers/#bidens-legacy&lt;/a&gt;
On the other hand, you have deferential leaders like Pete Buttigieg, who fill their own staff with status quo counsel, and then let those timid corporate apologists run the show, leaving the substantial enforcement powers of a powerful agency to gather dust:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge&lt;/a&gt;
While the Democrats' anti-corporate wing got to drive the administration's competition agencies, the corporate wing has enjoyed near-total dominance over finance regulations (with notable exceptions, e.g. Rohit Chopra), starting with Trump's Jerome Powell, a bloodletting monster happy to shovel workers into their bosses' crushers all day long:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/19/creditors-vs-workers/#finance-colored-glasses"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/19/creditors-vs-workers/#finance-colored-glasses&lt;/a&gt;
Corporate Dems continue to flex their muscle. A seat has just opened up on the Federal Reserve Board, and the WSJ is pretty sure the seat is going to Janice Eberly, a corporate ghoul who helped Obama Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner steal Americans' houses on behalf of the bankers who destroyed the world economy in 2008:
&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-considers-two-economists-for-fed-vice-chair-58f13344"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-considers-two-economists-for-fed-vice-chair-58f13344&lt;/a&gt;
A quick refresher: Obama inherited the Great Financial Crisis, a massive global asset crash that followed from a decade of real-estate and derivatives deregulation that saw the world's largest banks issuing mortgages they knew would fail, and then placing massive bets on "collateralized debt obligations" that were supposed to offset the risk.
The banks gambled trillions, nearly destroyed the world's economy, and then blamed it all on reckless borrowers - mortgage holders who had been mis-sold predatory mortgages that were designed to trigger defaults thanks to low "teaser rates" that later "ballooned" into monthly payments the banks knew the borrowers couldn't afford.
Geithner was Obama's go-to guy for the GFC. It was under his leadership that billions were handed out to the banks to bail them out and keep them solvent during the crisis - and it was also under his leadership that bank execs were able to pay themselves millions in bonuses using that public money.
When the banks were in trouble, Geithner leapt into action. When the banks' &lt;em&gt;customers&lt;/em&gt; faced crises, he was MIA - especially during the foreclosure epidemic that followed, as the banks stole our homes out from under us, often forging the paperwork. No bank was seriously punished for this policy.
Back to Janice Eberly, who served as Geithner's assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy - his hatchet-woman, in other words. Now, sometimes people in senior government roles stick around because they disagree with their bosses and want to mitigate the harm of their bosses' policies.
That's not why Eberly took the job. In 2014, she and Arvind Krishnamurthy co-wrote a Brookings Institute paper called "Efficient Credit Policies in a Housing Debt Crisis," that explained why Geithner had it right all along - bailing out the banks and leaving homeowners in foreclosure is "efficient":
&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fall2014bpea_eberly_krishnamurthy.pdf"&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fall2014bpea_eberly_krishnamurthy.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Writing in &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, Max Moran from the Revolving Door Project breaks down "Efficient Credit Policies," explaining how Eberly's stated views should disqualify her from sitting on the Fed board, especially as we teeter on the brink of a deep financial crisis:
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-06-janice-eberly-fed-nominee-mortgage-crisis/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-06-janice-eberly-fed-nominee-mortgage-crisis/&lt;/a&gt;
The first thing you need to understand here is HAMP, the Home Affordable Modification Program, which received the $100b Congress allocated to help homeowners whose mortgages were "underwater" - that is, whose houses were worth less than they owed for them.
That money could have gone to "principal reduction" - that is, to paying off part of your loan. If you owned $350,000 on a house that was now worth $300,000, the Feds could give the bank $50k and you wouldn't be underwater anymore. The FDIC proposed just this, in a plan that would have required homeowners to pay back the US government if the price of their homes rebounded.
If you want to keep Americans from losing their homes, principal reduction is a straightforward and reliable approach. But the banks hated this - and that meant Geithner wouldn't do it. Banks don't like principal reduction because it means that they'll lose out on future payments: reducing your principal by $50k now means that the banks won't get hundreds of thousands of dollars over the 30 years of your mortgage.
Using the money for principal reduction would have meant the banks' balance sheets would have looked a little worse - which, as Moran points out, is a perfectly fair outcome for banks that had just come close to destroying the world economy, especially since many of these underwater borrowers were destined to lose their houses and would never make those payments.
But Geithner didn't do principal reduction. Instead, he did HAMP, which was just a way to temporarily lower borrowers' monthly payments so they could stay in their homes. Geithner sold Obama on this plan, convincing him to renege on his election promise to support a "cramdown" on the banks, which would have saved homeowners:
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/dems-obama-broke-pledge-to-force-banks-to-help-homeowners"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/dems-obama-broke-pledge-to-force-banks-to-help-homeowners&lt;/a&gt;
HAMP was full of the kinds of complex requirements and paperwork that the professional managerial class love, rules that made it almost impossible for homeowners to invoke HAMP and improve their payments. Meanwhile, the banks got "investor incentive payments" that let them take in public money even as they foreclosed on the public:
&lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/principal-reduction-alternative-under-the-home-affordable-modification-program"&gt;https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/principal-reduction-alternative-under-the-home-affordable-modification-program&lt;/a&gt;
HAMP was a disaster. Almost no one managed to use it, and even among the lucky few who did manage to do so, many were tricked into foreclosure.
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/30/government-program-save-homes-mortgages-failure-banks"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/30/government-program-save-homes-mortgages-failure-banks&lt;/a&gt;
This is the policy that Eberly and Krishnamurthy defend in their paper: rather than reducing debt, just temporarily restructure mortgage payments. One reason they defend this: it's cheaper, and Congress didn't allocate enough money to help everyone who needed principal reduction. But, as Moran points out, Geithner's anemic response to the crisis caused Congress to claw back $225b of the money allocated to deal with it - enough to do $50k principal reductions for 4.5m households. Under Geithner, HAMP only spent $10b.
But of course, the US government didn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to pay the banks off to do principal reduction. They could simply order the banks to take a loss. That's how lending usually works: lenders who originate bad loans have to eat them - they don't get made whole by Uncle Sucker.
But when Eberly was working for Geithner, "federal officials convinced themselves this was impossible." Rather than hold banks to account for their reckless speculation, Geithner announced that he was going to "foam the runway" for the banks, pureeing Americans' homes to make the foam.
But Eberly's tenure coincided with the banks' rebound - by the time she went to work for Geithner, they were rolling in dough, posting massive profits. As Ryan Cooper put it, "If you force them to eat a bunch of foreclosure losses, maybe a few hundred billion over several years, it probably wouldn’t have been that bad."
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPLbnr1mxBs"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPLbnr1mxBs&lt;/a&gt;
Moran nails it here: "When a bad loan is made, it is both prudent and fair for the lender to bear the most responsibility. They are supposed to be wise stewards of their own capital. Instead, ordinary homeowners who did the least of any actor to cause the financial crisis ended up eating the losses."
Eberly and Krishnamurthy claimed that Geithner's policy would be efficient, and that it wouldn't lead to mass foreclosures. As neoclassical economists love to do, they "proved" this using elaborate mathematical models. And, also in the grand neoclassical tradition, they didn't bother to check whether their model was correct.
To quote Ely Devons: "If economists wished to study the horse, they wouldn’t go and look at horses. They’d sit in their studies and say to themselves, ‘What would I do if I were a horse?’"
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/27/economism/#what-would-i-do-if-i-were-a-horse"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/27/economism/#what-would-i-do-if-i-were-a-horse&lt;/a&gt;
Here's what Eberly and Krishnamurthy missed: the choice to foreclose wasn't being made by the lenders, they were being made by the mortgage servicer, a kind of consequence-free middleman who made more money by foreclosing on homeowners, even if the lenders lost more money over the long term:
&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228125783_Why_Servicers_Foreclose_When_They_Should_Modify_and_Other_Puzzles_of_Servicer_Behavior_Servicer_Compensation_and_its_Consequences"&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228125783_Why_Servicers_Foreclose_When_They_Should_Modify_and_Other_Puzzles_of_Servicer_Behavior_Servicer_Compensation_and_its_Consequences&lt;/a&gt;
Eberly and Krishnamurthy barely mention the existence of servicers, but another researcher was keenly aware of them: a law prof named Katie Porter, who delved into the servicers' role in foreclosure in a report for the California AG:
&lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/mortgage_settlement/01-report-waiting-for-change.pdf"&gt;https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/mortgage_settlement/01-report-waiting-for-change.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Porter identified the servicers' "dual track" approach to distressed mortgage borrowers: on the one hand, they slow-walked HARP-based changes to payments, and on the other hand, they raced to foreclose on those borrowers who were waiting for their payments to reset.
The servicers' hunger to throw people out of their homes knew no bounds: they set up massive robo-signing boiler-rooms where low-waged employees forged deeds to plug the paperwork holes created by the high-speed, unregulated speculation on mortgages that precipitated the Great Financial Crisis:
&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/robosigning-plea/ex-mortgage-document-exec-pleads-guilty-in-robo-signing-case-idUSL1E8ML0C120121121"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/robosigning-plea/ex-mortgage-document-exec-pleads-guilty-in-robo-signing-case-idUSL1E8ML0C120121121&lt;/a&gt;
Eberly knew about robo-signing, she knew about servicers, she knew about foreclosures. It was her job to know. But she still wrote her paper defending Geithner's runway-foaming and all those ruined lives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Principal reduction can be helpful, but it is a less efficient use of government resources, since it back-loads payments to households that cannot borrow against these future resources to support consumption today, and also because it is most helpful in reducing strategic default, rather than payment-distress-induced default,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is just means-testing by another name, a fetish for separating the "deserving poor" from "moochers" (AKA "strategic defaulters"). The PMC &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; means-testing, but only for poor people. As Moran points out, rich people like Trump use strategic defaults all the time:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/nyregion/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/nyregion/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html&lt;/a&gt;
Elite economists and finance ghouls convinced themselves that helping people stay in their homes would enable waves of crooked "strategic defaulting" but there's no evidence this was ever widespread - rather, it was a fairy tale that justified mass foreclosure:
&lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27585/w27585.pdf"&gt;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27585/w27585.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Eberly helped throw millions of Americans into the street in order to reward reckless banks, already wildly profitable banks, with even more profit. And far from regretting this, she went on to write elaborate justifications for the cruel policies she helped administer.
The historian Michael Hudson describes debt and debt cancellation as a key determinant of whether a given civilization survives. In every venture, producers have to borrow capital from lenders - farmers, for example, must borrow to pay for seed and fertilizer and labor. When the ventures are successful, the borrowers pay back the lenders.
But not every venture can succeed. There will always be blights, droughts, fires and other risks that can't be fully mitigated. When failure occurs, borrowers can't pay back creditors. If you farm long enough, you'll eventually lose a crop, and have to roll over your debts next year. Eventually, you'll owe so much that you can't even make the interest payments.
In the absence of some structured, periodic debt cancellation - such as the Bronze Age tradition of Jubilee - creditors eventually end up controlling the work of the entire productive sector. When that happens, your society stops producing what everyone needs, and instead just makes the things that rich people want:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/08/jubilant/#construire-des-passerelles"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/08/jubilant/#construire-des-passerelles&lt;/a&gt;
A civilization can't survive if all of its farmers are growing ornamental flowers for rich creditors' villas instead of staple crops. It can't survive if every productive worker is stuck in a dead-end job or a dead-end place because of medical or student debt.
Personnel are policy. Eberly has explained, in excruciating detail, exactly what policy she favors - policy that rewards reckless speculation by incinerating the life chances of everyday Americans. Appointing her to the Federal Reserve board would be a giant Fuck You from the Biden admin to every person who got their home stolen by a bank.

&lt;img alt="A stunning view of sunrise at Theodore Roosevelt National Park. In the foreground, a cigar-chomping, top-hatted ogre stands at a podium emblazoned with the Booz Allen logo, yanking on a lever made of a golden dollar-sign. He holds aloft an inverted National Park Service arrowhead logo, pinched disdainfully between his white-gloved thumb and forefinger. Rising up from behind a mountain on the left side of the frame is trustbuster-era editorial cartoon image of Roosevelt, swinging his 'Big Stick.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/booz-npc.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Booz Allen ticketmastered America's public lands (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/30/military-industrial-park-service/#booz-allen"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Ticketmaster's spectacular failure to competently sell tickets to Taylor Swift's first concert tour in five years has revived scrutiny of the ticketing/venue/promotion/management monopoly created by Ticketmaster's merger with Live Nation, especially the "junk fees" the company sucks out of fans' pockets:
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfPiqgLPro8"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfPiqgLPro8&lt;/a&gt;
What's a junk fee? It's all the crap that Ticketmaster tacks onto the cost of your ticket, like a "convenience fee" for using a credit card. Once all these fees are assessed, &lt;em&gt;78% of the price of some tickets&lt;/em&gt; is just fees.
&lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/10/biden-is-coming-for-high-ticketing-fees.html"&gt;https://www.vulture.com/2022/10/biden-is-coming-for-high-ticketing-fees.html&lt;/a&gt;
Junk fees aren't limited to Ticketmaster, they're everywhere: "resort fees" at hotels, bag and seat-selection fees on airlines, $35 fees for bounced checks, and on and on. Wherever a company has pricing power - because they're the only game in town, or because you're desperate - they rip you off with fees:
&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/1-biden-welcomes-crackdown-junk-161329851.html"&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/video/1-biden-welcomes-crackdown-junk-161329851.html&lt;/a&gt;
Take cable TV. The cable operators have divided up the USA like the Pope dividing up the New World, carefully demarcating each company's exclusive territory and ensuring that cable companies never compete with one another. That's why cable is such a dumpster-fire of junk fees - Comcast just jacked up its nonsense "broadcast fee" to $27/month:
&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/comcasts-sneaky-broadcast-tv-fee-hits-27-making-a-mockery-of-advertised-rates/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/comcasts-sneaky-broadcast-tv-fee-hits-27-making-a-mockery-of-advertised-rates/&lt;/a&gt;
OK, fine - turn off the TV and get out there and touch grass! America's system of national parks and public lands are the jewels in the country's crown, a remnant of those long-ago days when government could and did &lt;em&gt;do stuff&lt;/em&gt; for the American public, an art that (to hear conservatives tell) is now lost to the ages along with the secrets of the pyramids.
Just navigate to Recreation.gov, which consolidates permitting and entry for 13 federal agencies and...
::sad trombone::
...pay your junk fees.
Want to pay your $7 to hike the prized Coyote Buttes North at Arizona's Vermilion Cliffs National Monument? Sure, just pay a $9 "lottery application fee." Even by junk fee standards, this is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; junky fee - it's not a fee for paying a fee, it's a fee for &lt;em&gt;the chance to pay a fee&lt;/em&gt;.
Only 4-10% of lottery entrants get a permit (Coyote Buttes is a very fragile ecosystem and entrance is severely limited), which means that Recreation.gov's rake from this junk fee is about 1,000% of what it actually makes on hiking permits.
Well, at least that money is going to Coyote Buttes, right? Preserving the petroglyphs and the dinosaur tracks and whatnot?
Nope. The Bureau of Land Management gets the $7 entry fee from the 64 daily hikers who are lucky enough to visit Coyote Buttes. The $14,400 in lottery fees that the day's hopeful hikers pay to Recreation.gov for a shot at a permit all go to a giant military contractor: Booz Allen.
I know. What. The. Actual. Fuck. On his BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller explains how a beltway bandit like Booz Allen became the Ticketmaster of America's public lands. The deal started in 2017, when Booz got the contract to build Recreation.gov "at no cost to the federal government."
&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-is-booz-allen-renting-us-back"&gt;https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-is-booz-allen-renting-us-back&lt;/a&gt;
Booz Allen didn't promise to run a government website out of an abundance of patriotic zeal. Like all public private Partnership contractors, they wanted to figure out how to scoop of gigantic amounts of public money without any public accountability:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/01/the-palantir-will-see-you-now/#public-private-partnership"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/01/the-palantir-will-see-you-now/#public-private-partnership&lt;/a&gt;
Booz Allen now gets to run America's public lands like its own corporate fiefdom. At the  outset of its deal, it was able to set its own prices for fees unilaterally - that is, it could simply announce that, say, everyone who wanted to visit Mount Whitney would pay a $6 fee (16,000 applicants, 5,300 of them successful, $100,000 in junk fees for Booz).
But then Thomas Kotab, an "avid hiker," sued the BLM for the $2 junk fee tacked on top of the reservation system for Red Rock Canyon. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (the law that allows federal agencies to charge for access to public lands) requires that agencies hold a notice-and-comment for each of these fees. The $2 fee didn't go through this procedure.
Kotab won...sort of. The court upheld his challenge, requiring that Booz's public lands junk fees go through public notice. But Booz didn't refund the $2 it had illegally collected from the people it ripped off to visit Red Rock Canyon - and it figured out how to neuter the notice and comment system.
Here's how that works: the federal agencies that Booz ticketmasters each have a Resource Advisory Council, which the agencies stack with their own cronies, who then rubber-stamp whatever the agency wants to do. RACs pretend to be accountable to the public, but boy is the pretense thin:
&lt;a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5442009.pdf"&gt;https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5442009.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
So now, when Booz wants to tack a junk fee onto a public space, it gets the relevant agency to do a notice-and-comment for the fee, and the RAC files comments saying that this is a great idea, and the agency throws away all the public comments that say otherwise, and voila, Booz gets another junk fee.
All of this is incredibly frustrating, not just another example of corporate looting of the public's purse - a huge barrier to our public lands. The idea that the military industrial complex has ticketmastered Teddy Roosevelt's public parks should shock our consciences.
But there's something we can do about this! The part of the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act that authorizes agencies to assess fees runs out in Oct 2023, and when Congress renews it, they could add an amendment to block Booz's junk fees.
Or, as Stoller notes, "Biden, through his anti-junk fee initiative could simply assert through the White House Competition Council to the 13 different agencies that they end Booz Allen’s practice of charging these kinds of fees."

&lt;h1&gt;Amazon drivers hide phones in trees (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/02/free-steven-donziger/#phone-trees"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I've been a freelancer - a contractor - for most of my life, but I've also been a salaried employee and an hourly employee and there is a significant difference between all three.
Hourly and salaried work has some disadvantages in terms of independence and freedom, but they have one huge advantage: stability. As a freelancer, my pay yo-yos around - in some years, I'll have a month that's worth 30 times more than all the rest combined.
Which sounds great, until you turn it around: some years, I'll earn 1/30th of my top rate for 11 out of 12 months. Also: I don't get vacation pay, I pay for my own health care, etc. But for me, it makes sense: I work for lots of clients, do my paperwork, and get by.
Which brings me to the "gig economy" and its pretense people who do EXACTLY the kind of work as a waged or hourly employee are really independent contractors, despite being completely dependent on, and under the thumbs of, employers.
Gig economy work is a way to shift all the risks associated with being an employer onto your workforce, while hoarding all of the benefits that independent contractors customarily enjoy. For employers, it's a disposable workforce whom you owe nothing to.
For workers, it's a contractor's precarity without a contractor's independence.
Which brings me to Amazon drivers hanging cellphones from tree-branches.
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/amazon-drivers-are-hanging-smartphones-in-trees-to-get-more-work"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/amazon-drivers-are-hanging-smartphones-in-trees-to-get-more-work&lt;/a&gt;
You see: Amazon Flex drivers are not employees, they're contractors. Their boss is an app that decides, from moment to moment, whether they will get work and how much they'll get paid for it. The app uses a secret mix of factors to make these determinations.
These drivers are like mice on an intermittent reinforcement schedule, getting work according to factors that they are not privy to and cannot predict.
In the immortal words of William Gibson: "Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb
permanently on the fast-forward button."
(this is your periodic reminder that cyberpunk was a warning, not a suggestion)
Amazon Flex drivers develop various folk theories of how the app works, and one of these - which sounds plausible to me - is that you are more likely to get a job if the app thinks you're physically close to a pickup spot.
So: in the Chicago suburbs, desperate Amazon Flex drivers, competing with one another for the unknown sums on offer for making deliveries, stash phones in the branches of trees close to Whole Foods and other Amazon distribution points.
This tricks the Amazon Flex app into thinking that they are on the very doorstep of the distribution point, upping their chances of getting a delivery (the drivers sync a second phone to their tree-phones, so they get alerted when they get a job).
Labor economists talk about "chickenization," named for the hyperconcentrated poultry industry: chicken farmers are notionally independent contractors, but they have no independence.
Big Chicken tells the farmers how to build their coops, sells them their chicks, specs out medicine, feed and light systems. But the meat-packers don't tell farmers how much they'll get paid until the chickens are delivered.
The poultry industry - which has divided up the country so that each region only has one processor - does analytics to decide how much to pay, titrating the money-drip so that it's enough to survive, but not enough to get ahead.
That way they can hold out the threat of a canceled contract to any worker caught "cheating" - say, by speaking out to regulators about these abusive practices.
You'll never guess what Amazon has proposed to do about the fact that its drivers are so desperate they're hanging phones from tree-branches.
They've promised to investigate and discipline the drivers.
Because when your workforce is totally chickenized, you don't need to correct these dysfunctions by eliminating the need for worker "misconduct" (say, by paying workers a steady, predictable rate).
Instead, you can treat any attempt by your "independent contractors" to increase their leverage as a form of fraud and punish them.

&lt;h1&gt;Russia didn't hack Michigan (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/02/free-steven-donziger/#mittenski"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
You know that "massive Russian hack of all Michigan voter data" that hit the news Tuesday morning? That "hacked data" was just public records.
&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200901/08345545223/fake-russian-hack-public-michigan-voter-rolls-gets-absurdly-overhyped-interwebs.shtml"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200901/08345545223/fake-russian-hack-public-michigan-voter-rolls-gets-absurdly-overhyped-interwebs.shtml&lt;/a&gt;
Indeed, this kind of voter-roll hack is pretty common, but all the hackers are doing is getting data that is lawfully, commercially available for relatively low prices without having to pay for it:
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjx3v/voting-records-get-hacked-a-lot-and-you-can-just-buy-them-anyway"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjx3v/voting-records-get-hacked-a-lot-and-you-can-just-buy-them-anyway&lt;/a&gt;
The hacked data from Michigan is the same qualified voter info that anyone can get through a Freedom of Information Act request:
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackhcable/status/1300805955366670336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;https://twitter.com/jackhcable/status/1300805955366670336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&lt;/a&gt;
But as Karl Bode describes, there is one genuinely nefarious thing about this: the hackers are said to have reported their data-dump to the US government's Rewards for Justice tipline, which pays for information about security vulnerabilities US government infrastructure.
Don't get me wrong: Touchscreen voting machines remain a goddamned dumpster fire of security vulnerabilities. The US should conduct pencil-and-paper balloting. But this Russia-hacked-Michigan story? It's just дезинформация.

&lt;h1&gt;Chevron's dirty tricks against environmental lawyer (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/02/free-steven-donziger/#free-donziger"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Some stories are so vast and ghastly that they overwhelm our consciousness, beggaring our ability to hold them in our heads all at once. This is one of them, and it involves Chevron and what amounts to genocide, where the only person headed to jail is the victims' lawyer.
Back when Chevron was Texaco, the company engaged in a campaign of environmental genocide on indigenous land in Ecuador, abetted by the brutal military dictatorship. Its recklessness - thousands of open-air, unlined pits of heavy metal waste - poisoned five communities.
The indigenous people Chevron poisoned lived in abject, toxic poverty, with carcinogens saturating their food, water and air. They and their children contracted cancer at terrible rates, and died and died and died.
The environmental lawyer Steven Donziger sued Chevron, winning an unprecedented $9.5B judgment. Chevron responded by threatening a "lifetime of litigation" if their victims tried to collect and circulated an internal memo laying out a plan to "demonize Donziger."
Enter SDNY Judge Lewis A Kaplan, a former tobacco company lawyer with undisclosed Chevron holdings. Chevron sued Donziger in Kaplan's court, proposing an obviously fraudulent theory that he had bribed the Ecuadoran judge who made the award.
The case was so flimsy (the Ecuadoran judge had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Chevron prior to his accusation, and then later recanted it under oath at a World Bank tribunal) that NY prosecutors wouldn't take itup.
So Kaplan used an obscure legal maneuver to appoint a corporate law-firm (with extensive ties to Chevron) to privately prosecute Donziger.
As part of this kangaroo court proceeding, they demanded that Donziger turn over his laptop and phone, including lawyer-client privileged confidential files, to Chevron's lawyers. Naturally, Donziger refused.
Kaplan charged him contempt and ordered him held in pre-trial detention (house arrest). He's been locked up for more than a year.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/14/poesy-the-monster-slayer/#privilege-private-law"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/14/poesy-the-monster-slayer/#privilege-private-law&lt;/a&gt;
Now things are coming to a head.
Kaplan has announced his intent to proceed with Donziger's trial, reopening the SDNY's criminal court for the first time since March, jumping Donziger ahead of accused rapists and murderers.
Donziger is the &lt;em&gt;only person in the entire USA&lt;/em&gt; in pretrial detention for a misdemeanor. His detention - 13 months - is four times longer than the longest sentence &lt;em&gt;ever served&lt;/em&gt; by a lawyer facing the same charge.
If Donziger goes to trial on Sept 9, it will be without adequate representation. Kaplan has removed &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of his in-state lawyers on a flimsy pretense, and the dozens of other pro-bono lawyers representing him are out of state and cannot travel safely.
Donziger has been denied his petition to delay the trial until December. He's also been denied the right to trial by jury. If he loses, the judge can send him to prison immediately for a sentence of six months, in the midst of the pandemic - a potential death-sentence.
Look, I know this sounds unbelievable. Don't take my word for it. Have a look at this in-depth article by the Pulitzer-winning investigative journalist Chris Hedges.
&lt;a href="https://scheerpost.com/2020/08/25/how-corporate-tyranny-works/"&gt;https://scheerpost.com/2020/08/25/how-corporate-tyranny-works/&lt;/a&gt;
And then check out this judicial complaint against Kaplan, co-signed by organizations representing 500,000 lawyers worldwide and 200 individual US lawyers:
&lt;a href="https://iadllaw.org/2020/09/more-than-200-lawyers-file-judicial-complaint-against-judge-lewis-a-kaplan-over-abusive-targeting-of-human-rights-advocate-steven-donziger/"&gt;https://iadllaw.org/2020/09/more-than-200-lawyers-file-judicial-complaint-against-judge-lewis-a-kaplan-over-abusive-targeting-of-human-rights-advocate-steven-donziger/&lt;/a&gt;
They are joined by 29 Nobel laureates, a coalition of global human rights groups, and many others who have decried Kaplan's conduct and Donziger's legal jeopardy.

&lt;h1&gt;Amazon's weird, terrible Flex (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/02/free-steven-donziger/#chickenized-flex"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Amazon Flex is a "gig economy" delivery system that maintains the pretence that drivers are independent contractors, even as their motions are scripted to a fine degree by an app whose control over them exceeds that of any boss in history.
As with all gig economy work, the "independent contractor" wheeze is just a ruse to shift the risks and costs of being an employer onto the workforce, without any of the independence that real freelancers enjoy.
Amazon Flex drivers are a "chickenized" workforce, whose pay is determined by a black-box algorithm tuned to keep them on the brink of financial ruin (which is why Flex drivers have started &lt;em&gt;hiding their phones in trees&lt;/em&gt;):
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1300878795394617345"&gt;https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1300878795394617345&lt;/a&gt;
Which is why Amazon maintains an extensive spy network of "analysts" who infiltrate its drivers' private Facebook groups, a fact we discovered when Amazon's internal counterintelligence system leaked to Motherboard's Lauren Gurley and Joseph Cox.
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azegw/amazon-is-spying-on-its-workers-in-closed-facebook-groups-internal-reports-show"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azegw/amazon-is-spying-on-its-workers-in-closed-facebook-groups-internal-reports-show&lt;/a&gt;
Specifically, Amazon's spooks gather data on efforts to form unions or attract attention from the press, lawmakers and regulators.
That may seem like garden-variety (illegal) union-busting (and it is), but think about this in light of the "independent contractor" fiction.
According to Amazon, each of these drivers is a "small business" in its supply chain, like the sellers who put products in the Amazon Marketplace or the publishers who supply books for the Kindle.
Amazon's intelligence op is a mass surveillance effort &lt;em&gt;targeting small businesses who sell it services&lt;/em&gt;. If we are to believe that drivers are independent contractors, then this is like Amazon sending out spies to infiltrate every publisher in America.
Or putting covert informants in the factories of all its suppliers to keep it apprised of any negative publicity that might attend its efforts to squeeze them for higher discounts.
This is clearly not an isolated incident: surveillance of workers is baked into its DNA. This is, after all, the company that maintains a predictive, algorithmic "heat-map" of labor unrest in Whole Foods stores:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/21/all-in-it-together/#guard-labor-v-redistribution"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/21/all-in-it-together/#guard-labor-v-redistribution&lt;/a&gt;
And it's also the company that - just this week - advertised for "intelligence analysts" with military backgrounds to monitor the internet for signs of labor organizing, activist opposition, and "hostile" lawmakers and regulators.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Oregon_ballot_return_box.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to report on vote-by-mail (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/02/free-steven-donziger/#write-the-vote"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Vote-by-mail wasn't my first pick for "top election year controversy," but here we are. Vote-by-mail is sufficiently obscure that few members of the public or journalists (or, for that member, Presidents of the United States) understand it very well.
So I was very glad to see Rachel Glickhouse and Jessica Huseman's "reporting recipe" for vote-by-mail stories in Propublica:
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/reporting-recipe-how-to-report-on-voting-by-mail"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/reporting-recipe-how-to-report-on-voting-by-mail&lt;/a&gt;
Glickhouse and Huseman provide a checklist for would-be vote-by-mail reporters to figure out how things should work, and how they are actually working, and how to explain any discrepancy.
The recipe is in three stages.
I. Learn the process: Who's eligible? Has the process changed? Are there current legal challenges? What are the voter ID laws? How do people obtain ID if the DMV is closed? Do you need a printer and stamp to request a ballot?
What do absentee ballots look like? What are the application and ballot deadlines? Might they change due to court challenges? Is there enough time between deadlines given current USPS delays? Who's paying for ballot postage?
How many drop boxes will there be? Are there restrictions? Why? What's the "cure" process for ballots with problems? What do voters do if they don't receive ballots?
The writers suggest the Vote at Home Institute, the National Conference of State Legislatures , the Brennan Center and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights for research starts.
II. Evaluate Preparedness: How many people used mail-in ballots in your state/county in 2016 and 2018? Have election officials coordinated with postal officials? What postal-ballot-processing equipment is on hand? How much funding is there for voter education?
What's the local post office doing to prepare? How many mail ballots were rejected previously? What are election officials doing about the most common causes of rejections? What's your state's plan for distributing CARES Act funding for elections?
III. Show and Tell: Explain (with video, if possible) how to fill in a postal ballot. Give voters the deadlines, signature and ID requirements. Get a tour of postal ballot storage and counting facilities, including security measures.
Find out how drop boxes are checked and secured. Give the status of any pending litigation over vote-by-mail.

&lt;b&gt;Update: The naming rights/Tuckerization from this fundraiser sold almost immediately after this post went live, so &lt;a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/locus-magazine-science-fiction-fantasy-horror"&gt;we've added another one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update 2: This one sold, too.&lt;/b&gt;
Since 1968, &lt;em&gt;Locus&lt;/em&gt; magazine has been the paper of record for science fiction, fantasy and horror literature; it's been through several iterations, but the current one - a crowd-supported nonprofit - is the best yet. They're raising $75k on Indiegogo to fund the next year's operations:
&lt;a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/locus-magazine-science-fiction-fantasy-horror/"&gt;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/locus-magazine-science-fiction-fantasy-horror/&lt;/a&gt;
I started writing a bimonthly column for &lt;em&gt;Locus&lt;/em&gt; in 2006; I've written six columns per year for them ever since, without missing a single one, and every one of them is open access on the same day it comes out in print:
&lt;a href="https://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/07DoctorowCommentary.html"&gt;https://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/07DoctorowCommentary.html&lt;/a&gt;
After &lt;em&gt;Locus&lt;/em&gt; founder Charles N Brown died in 2009 - in his sleep, on a plane, coming back from an sf con he'd covered for the magazine - his staff took over the magazine and its vast archive of science fiction ephemera and restructured it as a nonprofit. Brown's collection went to Duke University:
&lt;a href="https://blogs.library.duke.edu/rubenstein/2019/01/11/locus-archives-documents-the-history-of-sci-fi/"&gt;https://blogs.library.duke.edu/rubenstein/2019/01/11/locus-archives-documents-the-history-of-sci-fi/&lt;/a&gt;
The magazine pressed on, continuing as the best source of industry news, thoughtful reviews (including short fiction reviews, a rarity these days) and opinion, as well as its essential annual recommended reading list and its Locus Awards. I devour each issue.
Earlier this year, the editorial team wrote to me and asked me what I could donate to the fundraiser. My contribution is a "Tuckerization" - naming rights for a character - for an upcoming Marty Hench novel, one of the sequels to my forthcoming &lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt; (Tor Books, 2023).
&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865847/red-team-blues"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865847/red-team-blues&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt; is my first noir novel, a detective story whose hero is Marty Hench, a Silicon Valley forensic accountant who's spent 40 years unwinding every finance scam tech, and who, on the eve of his retirement, is roped into a bloody, deadly cryptocurrency heist.
This is one of my lockdown books (I have &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; books forthcoming as of this writing), and it was a wild ride to write. I love noir fiction, but it has an odious side: the prototypical noir hero is a veteran (in early noir, he'll be a WWI vet in the interwar years; in later noir, he's a WWII vet in the 50s or 60s), who has come home to a changed and fallen world.
Everywhere these heroes look, the wrong people are participating in society as his equal: queers, women, people of color. The foundational vibe of noir - a simmering rage at the state of the world - is grounded in incredible, reactionary bigotry.
Marty Hench is also bitter about what his world has become, but the invaders he rails against are the crooked finance bros who leech off of the genuine excitement and creativity of early techies who want to help everyone "seize the means of computation." He is &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt; at them, and he expresses his fury by unwinding their baroque scams and busting them, but the supply of finance bros is limitless, and for every one he slays, five more pop up.
I finished &lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt; in about eight weeks and handed it to my usual first readers, from whom I got &lt;em&gt;unusual&lt;/em&gt; responses. The day I finished it, I woke up at 2AM to find my wife sitting up with the bedside lamp on. I asked her what she was doing, and she looked up from the book and said "I had to find out how it ended."
Then I emailed it to my editor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden. The next day, he emailed me this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  That.
  Was.
  A! Fucking! Ride!
  Whoa!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Then he bought it, and two more books in the series.
Now, attentive readers will have noted that &lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt; is Marty Hench's &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; adventure. That means that the rest of the series will be an indeterminate number of &lt;em&gt;prequels&lt;/em&gt;, explaining how the Marty Hench of &lt;em&gt;RTB&lt;/em&gt; came into being. The next book in the series is &lt;em&gt;The Bezzle&lt;/em&gt;, set in the mid-2000s, which sees Marty go up against a corrupt prison IT baron who waxes unimaginably wealthy by eliminating prison mail and visits and  replacing them with high-priced, per-minute "visits" and emails on a "free" tablet; I finished the first draft of this one last week.
The book after that, &lt;em&gt;Picks and Shovels&lt;/em&gt;, is Marty's first adventure, telling the story of how his obsession with early computers led to him flunking out of MIT, then discovering the miracle of spreadsheets at a community college accounting program. Everyone else in his class wants to use spreadsheets to &lt;em&gt;hide&lt;/em&gt; money, but Marty wants to use them to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; it.
Marty follows his roommate out to Silicon Valley, where he lands his first job: helping track down an insider threat for an early PC company called The Three Wise Men, a predatory affinity scam run by a Mormon bishop, a Catholic priest and an orthodox rabbi.
The action gets going when Marty figures out that the "insider threat" he's been sent after are on the side of the angels: a rival tech company founded by three women who've left Three Wise Men to compete with it.
They've also left their faith: a queer orthodox woman who renounces due to her rabbi's homophobia, a Mormon woman who leaves the church over its opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment, and a nun who throws in with radical Liberation Theology over the dirty wars in Central America. This one is about halfway done and will be finished by spring.
Each of these books is a period piece, steeped in a highly specific time and place: Silicon Valley in the grips of the crypto bubble; central California prison towns during the Trump years; San Francisco in the heroic era of the first PC bubble.
The &lt;em&gt;Locus&lt;/em&gt; Tuckerization will let you name one of the characters in one of these sequels. It's a chance some (minor) immortality, but more importantly, it's a chance to sustain a magazine that has promoted and aided the careers of every working sf/f/h writer in the field, including and especially me.
It's not just the Tuckerization, of course! There are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of other wonderful premiums in the crowdfunder:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exclusive access to a deleted scene from Mary Robinette Kowal's &lt;em&gt;Spare Man&lt;/em&gt;, a signed manuscript for an as-yet unpublished novel, and/or a 30-minute Zoom with Mary Robinette;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;many signed books from authors' own collections;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a signed, handwritten apology from Kelly Robson because she's "soooo sorry they totally wrecked you with their story";&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a private Zoom chat with legendary editor Ellen Datlow, or sf writers Stephanie Burgis or Justina Ireland;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a story critique from award-winning writers Kate Heartfield or Sam J. Miller;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a Tuckerization from Wole Talabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More awards are going up daily, and the campaign closes in 10 days. As of this writing, they've raised $54,539 of their $75,000 goal.

&lt;h1&gt;The extremely shady "educational integrity" industry (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/16/unauthorized-paper/#cheating-anticheat"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The pandemic presented an opportunity to reconsider our seemingly immutable assumptions about life - for adults, anyway. We got the Great Resignation and "hybrid" work-from-home. Our kids got remote learning. Ugh.
Don't get me wrong: remote learning has its advantages, especially for kids coping with physical and mental health issues, kids with passionate out-of-school interests and kids escaping a discriminatory and bullying environment (this isn't as good as &lt;em&gt;addressing&lt;/em&gt; discrimination and bullying, but...).
But the remote learning boom has emboldened the absolute worst in the ed-tech sector. It's not just that these companies are price-gouging our schools and normalizing surveillance for kids - they're reinforcing everything terrible about educational assessment, and (incredibly), making it even worse.
High-stakes test-taking is widely understood to have little pedagogical value. To the extent that it measures learning, it only does so for one chunk of learners, and all too often, it's just measuring test-taking ability. In other words, scoring high on a  high-stakes test can mean that you're good at tests, or that you understand the material. Scoring low can mean that you're bad at tests, or that you don't understand the material. High-stakes tests advance a cohort of good-at-test kids and good-at-the subject kids, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; flunk a cohort of bad-at-test kids (who may be &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; at the subject) as well as kids who haven't mastered the material.
It's not like there aren't alternatives. Pedagogists have a whole arsenal of continuous assessment and project-based tools for measuring their students' progress.
&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3871423"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3871423&lt;/a&gt;
These have several advantages over high-stakes testing. For one thing, they &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, even in remote learning contexts. High-stakes testing, on the other hand, is even worse when it's remote.
Obviously.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/24/proctor-ology/#miseducation"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/24/proctor-ology/#miseducation&lt;/a&gt;
High-stakes testing starts from the presumption that students are their teachers' adversaries, and must be prevented from "cheating." That's hard enough to manage when the test is taken under controlled conditions, but it's absurd when the test is being taken in the student's own home.
For some adults, the pandemic was a chance to exercise agency: to quit their jobs, or demand better working conditions and more flexibility. Not so for kids. Just as remote learning was creating an opportunity to end the pedagogical nonsense of high-stakes testing, the "remote invigilation" industry deployed an army of grinning, bullshitting salesdroids to convince school systems to double down on remote testing.
Chief among these is Proctorio, a company whose sleaze cannot be overstated. Proctorio leads the "remote invigilation" industry, which forces students to install spyware on their computers to oversee their test-taking. This software uses "facial recognition" (which can't recognize Black faces unless students aim multiple task lights directly into their eyes) to monitor students. The facial recognition is used to punish students who look away while taking their tests (for example, looking up or to one side while thinking).
A remote invigilation session begins with a student being forced to show all parts of their room to a live human overseer. Students who live in cramped quarters - say, students who share a room with an "essential worker" who works night shifts - are forced to invade the privacy and interrupt the activities of their family members.
Students who live in broadband deserts - like the kids in California who were forced to take their tests in a Taco Bell parking lot where they could get free wifi - are punished for broadband companies' unwillingness to serve their communities.
The live operator doesn't always disappear after a kid exposes their room. Sometimes, live operators virtually stare over students' shoulders as they take their tests. Sometimes, these impatient, invisible overseers reach into test-takers' computers to jiggle their mouses, as a goad to get them to move on.
What if you have a disability and need to stand up, go to the toilet, or throw up from anxiety? Or (I'm not making this up!) experience labor pains? Tough. Proctorio and its competitors have no way to accommodate you, and so they flag you and flunk you.
A lot of these facts came to light thanks to whistleblowers like Ian Linkletter. When Linkletter was an ed-tech specialist tasked with evaluating Proctorio's products, he discovered a horrifying set of "features" that were not in the company's public disclosures. Linkletter tweeted about these, including links to the company's publicly accessible (but unlisted) Youtube videos. The company responded by suing him for copyright infringement and a host of other flimsy pretexts that were clearly aimed at silencing a critic:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/17/proctorio-v-linkletter/#proctorio"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/17/proctorio-v-linkletter/#proctorio&lt;/a&gt;
Even thought Linkletter raised more than CAD85,000 and invoked British Columbia's anti-SLAPP law, he is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; in court, a year and a half later:
&lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-against-proctorio"&gt;https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-against-proctorio&lt;/a&gt;
Proctorio doesn't confine its bullying to adult educators. The company's CEO &lt;em&gt;personally doxed a child&lt;/em&gt; who complained about his products on a Reddit forum:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/01/bossware/#moral-exemplar"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/01/bossware/#moral-exemplar&lt;/a&gt;
Remember, Proctorio bills itself as being on the vanguard of the "educational integrity" movement. But "integrity" takes on a very different meaning when the goal is to secure the "integrity" of the &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt; and not the integrity of the &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt;. In the former case, the student is an enemy to be outsmarted. In the latter, the student is a partner to be enlisted.
High-stakes testing profiteers like Proctorio justify deceptive, bullying tactics by painting learners as "cheats" - a species of presumptive criminal who needs to be pre-emptively incarcerated in its digital prisons.
This distortion of the learning process carries over into every sector of the "educational integrity" industry. Take Honorlock, a high-ticket ed-tech profiteer that "is revolutionizing the academic integrity of online assessment."
Honorlock is an also-ran competitor of Proctorio. In its effort to differentiate itself from the market-leading abuser, they have found new ways to victimize and deceive learners in the name of "integrity."
A new investigation by The Markup's Colin Lecher unravels a secret operation by Honorlock to entrap students with "honeypot" web-sites that purport to give the answers to test questions, but actually capture students' IP addresses and nark them out to their profs:
&lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/machine-learning/2022/02/15/a-network-of-fake-test-answer-sites-is-trying-to-incriminate-students"&gt;https://themarkup.org/machine-learning/2022/02/15/a-network-of-fake-test-answer-sites-is-trying-to-incriminate-students&lt;/a&gt;
The scam was uncovered by Kurt Wilson, a CS major at the University of Central Florida, who became obsessed with learning more about how his tuition money was being spent. He found at least five deceptive Honorlock-linked websites that pretended to be answers sites.
Lecher quotes experts, like U Calgary's Sarah Eaton, who call this "entrapment" and point out the irony of a company that monitors "integrity" engaging in deception. Ceceilia Parnther likens it to profs putting the answer key on the corner of a test-taker's desk and penalizing them if they look at it.
Universities spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for Honorlock services - money that could be spent developing and supporting assessment techniques that treat students as learners, not cheaters, and provide a better picture of each student's progress with the material.
But that would involve pedagogical integrity - the kind of integrity that puts learning, not ease of assessment, first. It would mean funding teachers, not VC-backed ed-tech profiteers seeking a return on their backers' investment. It requires that students be treated as partners, not adversaries.

The printer industry has always surfed the leading edge of dystopian business practices, pioneering the most disgusting, deceptive tactics for ripping off customers by locking them into buying half-full ink cartridges at $12,000/gallon.
Printer companies have used &lt;em&gt;copyright law&lt;/em&gt; to attack refillers, pushed out fake "security updates" to trick you into installing code to block third-party ink, cheated and lied to block "security chips" from being harvested from e-waste and used in new cartridges and more.
There is no depth so low that printer companies will not stoop to it. Forcing you to waste ink by printing "calibration sheets"? Sure. Suckering buyers with "lifetime" ink deals and then suddenly ending them? Why not?
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer&lt;/a&gt;
But there's one depravity that no printer company has managed: putting DRM in &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt;. Oh, not for lack of will! But adding DRM to paper is hard, because paper is...well, it's paper. Pressed sheets of vegetable pulp. It's hard to put a cop-chip in a sheet of paper.
But what about a &lt;em&gt;roll&lt;/em&gt; of paper?
See where this is going?
&lt;img alt="Dymo embossing tape label maker around 1967" src="https://craphound.com/images/1024px-Dymo_embossing_label_maker_circa_1967.jpg"/&gt;
If you're a well-organized person, you might have a Dymo label maker around the house. I grew up with Dymo's original embossing tape label makers and gleefully labeled everything important to me.
In the years since the company was founded, it's been agglomerated, snapped up by Newell Brands, owners of Rubbermaid, Mr Coffee, Yankee Candles, Elmer's, Sharpie, X-Acto and many others:
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newell_Brands#Brands"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newell_Brands#Brands&lt;/a&gt;
Divisions at these corporate hydras are under relentless pressure to wring more profits out of their workhorse products. Which is how Dymo came to invent - wait for it - &lt;em&gt;DRM for paper&lt;/em&gt;.
Dymo's desktop label-makers enjoyed a boom during the lockdown, thanks to the shift to e-commerce and the demand for shipping labels. But those windfall profits weren't enough for the company. They just released two new models, the 550 and the 5XL, whose DRM prevents you from using third-party labels:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/worst-timeline-printer-company-putting-drm-paper-now"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/worst-timeline-printer-company-putting-drm-paper-now&lt;/a&gt;
Third-party labels for desktop label-makers are ubiquitous. Different manufacturers produce them, differentiating on materials, size, and adhesive. Oh, and price, naturally. Dymo's own-brand labels are fine, but they cost more than comparable rival labels.
The new label rolls come with a booby-trap: a RFID-equipped microcontroller that authenticates with your label-maker to attest that you bought Dymo's premium-priced labels and not a competitors. The chip counts down the labels as you print them (so you can't transplant it to a generic label roll).
Dymo clearly understands that its customers don't want this. Dymo owners who buy non-Dymo labels aren't being tricked into it - they're seeking out alternatives. No surprise that Dymo's sales materials don't mention this new, unprecedented restriction.
In forums and online reviews, Dymo owners are fuming, rightly accusing the company of ripping them off. Some are speculating about how to reprogram the cop-chip in their labels, but anyone who provides a tool to do so risks felony prosecution under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (penalty: 5 years and $500k for a first offense).
This is a good reason to reform or overturn the DMCA (as EFF is seeking to do with its lawsuit against the US government):
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/green-v-us-department-justice"&gt;https://www.eff.org/cases/green-v-us-department-justice&lt;/a&gt;
But in the meantime, this is a rare instance in which individuals can make a difference. Dymo has &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of competitors, whose comparable printers cost the same as the new DRM-burdened models. Even with the cost of throwing away your new Dymo and buying a Zebra or MFLabel replacement, you will still come out ahead once you factor in the savings from buying any labels you choose.
Dymo is floating a trial balloon here, checking to see whether printer owners will accept DRMed paper as well as ink (ironically, Dymo pitches the fact that its label printers are inkless as an advantage because you sidestep ink price-gouging!). We can pop that balloon before it attains altitude.
Tell your friends.

&lt;h1&gt;A TRAP for workers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
One of the weirdest parts of conspiratorialism is the hunt for anagrams as secret expressions of guilt. Ken Cheng's recent BBC Comedy of the Week show, he has a great bit on this, pointing out how weird it is that someone figured out that "delta" and "omicron" are an anagram for "media control."
&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0ckq7pb"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0ckq7pb&lt;/a&gt;
As Cheng says, "do they think the coronavirus was invented by Tom Marvolo Riddle?" And yet, sometimes, villains really &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use word-games to tip their hands. How else to explain that Petsmart's predatory "job training" scheme for new hires is called TRAP?
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/contract-clause-loading-us-workers-with-debt/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/contract-clause-loading-us-workers-with-debt/&lt;/a&gt;
TRAP - "training repayment agreement provision" - was billed as a free job training scheme for new Petsmart hires, a 4-week program to teach you to groom cats and dogs. But this "free" program actually loaded new hires up with $5500 in debt that they owed to the company if they quit, got fired, or were laid off within two years.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LifeatPetSmart/status/1148626627389267969"&gt;https://twitter.com/LifeatPetSmart/status/1148626627389267969&lt;/a&gt;
In a darkly hilarious turn, TRAP didn't even train you to groom pets. As a new class action suit led by ex-Petsmart employee BreAnn Scally reveals, most of the "training" was just sweeping floors, and the "four-week" course ended after three weeks.
&lt;a href="https://protectborrowers.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PetSmart-complaint_file.pdf"&gt;https://protectborrowers.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PetSmart-complaint_file.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
As Caitlin Harrington writes for &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, California law actually prohibits these schemes, barring employers from clawing back training expenses unless they "primarily benefit the worker." Additionally, California employers are prohibited from  "operating as an unlicensed post-secondary school."
But employers know that workers are at a disadvantage when it comes to enforcing these laws. Indeed, it's hard to know how Scally - who was making $15/hour and relying on family members to cover her monthly shortfall - could have sought justice against the private equity backed Petsmart except through class-action suits.
It's easy for employers to bar their workers from participating in class-action suits: all they need to do is subject those workers to "binding arbitration" agreements where they surrender their right to seek justice in courtrooms, and instead must plead their case to a fake corporate judge (an "arbitrator") who is paid by the employer who wronged them.
Some clever lawyers have developed a fantastic countermove to this, the "mass arbitration" action, where hundreds or thousands of workers or customers bulk-file arbitration claims, forcing the company that harmed them to pay thousands of dollars for arbitrators to hear each claim:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/hot-coffee/#mcgeico"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/hot-coffee/#mcgeico&lt;/a&gt;
But convicted monopolist Microsoft continues to lead the corporate world in innovative fuckery. They've just updated their terms and conditions to ban mass arbitration:
&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/upcoming-updates.aspx?tduid=(e6d11a05aa8500a3b4be6d4c42131db4)(266696)(1503186)(33330X911642Xf7acc8227d2c85bbb5b31c0b2833ea5b)()"&gt;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/upcoming-updates.aspx?tduid=(e6d11a05aa8500a3b4be6d4c42131db4)(266696)(1503186)(33330X911642Xf7acc8227d2c85bbb5b31c0b2833ea5b)()&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  For customers in the United States, in the Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section, we’ve added procedures if 25 or more customers file coordinated arbitrations. These arbitrations would be resolved in batches of up to 50 individual arbitrations. After each batch of up to 50 is resolved, the next batch of up to 50 individual arbitrations could be filed. We’ve clarified that arbitrators may award injunctions that would affect you and us only. We’ve also clarified that if a court finds part of this section unenforceable, an arbitrator would resolve all arbitrable claims and remedies before any court proceeding begins on remaining ones. We’ve given courts rather than arbitrators authority to decide more issues, including whether this section is enforceable and what it covers, and to enjoin arbitrations that don’t comply with it. We’ve also provided that small claims court cases may be filed in your home county only.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It's only a matter of time until this evil fuckery proliferates into every binding arbitration agreement, which would allow companies using TRAP clauses to get away with it, free from the risk of either class action or mass arbitration.
What's that? "Companies using TRAP clauses?" Yes, companies. Petsmart is by no means alone in creating a modern system of indenture, where your employer can fine you for quitting your job, and mire you in debt even if they lay you off.
A report called "Trapped at Work" from The Student Borrower Protection Center shows how TRAP clauses have found their way into "hair salons, hospital chains, IT firms, and trucking companies," sectors that together account for a third of all US workers:
&lt;a href="https://protectborrowers.org/trapped-at-work-how-big-business-uses-student-debt-to-restrict-worker-mobility/"&gt;https://protectborrowers.org/trapped-at-work-how-big-business-uses-student-debt-to-restrict-worker-mobility/&lt;/a&gt;
As the report notes, these employers TRAP their workers with bills in the "tens of thousands of dollars" and charge extremely high interest rates. Harrington points out that Petsmart's contracts promise "the highest rate permitted by law of the state in which this agreement was executed."
Like binding arbitration, TRAP clauses started out as a way to simplify negotiations between extremely powerful entities, but quickly became a means to extinguish any hope of justice in dealings between the wealthy and the poor. The first TRAP clauses were introduced in the 1980s for high-paid professionals such as "engineers, security brokers, and airline pilots."
But the erosion of labor law and the disappearance of unions freed up employers to TRAP all kinds of low-waged workers. Harrington points to the scholarship of Loyola Law's' Jonathan F Harris, who has documented this in detail:
&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3642017"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3642017&lt;/a&gt;
TRAPs are ways for employers to get around the few remaining labor protection laws, like California's ban on noncompete agreements and the antitrust laws than ban employers for forming secret "no poach" deals that suppress wages. But they're also a way to head off the Great Resignation, by fining low-waged workers several months' pay for having the temerity to quit, and then smacking them with usurious interest rates.
TRAPs mean that workers who speak up about unfair or unsafe conditions. Carmen Comsti from National Nurses United told Harrington that the $10,000 TRAPs the monopolist HCA Health burdens nurses with mean that nurses are unwilling to speak out practices that harm patients - because if they get fired, they'll owe HCA $10k. And, as with Petsmart, the $10k "training" that HCA charges its nurses for is "regular old orientation that you would get on the job no matter what."
TRAPping workers requires a mix of desperation and deception. Workers who have the power to negotiate the terms of their employment will obviously try to eliminate TRAP clauses, so their new bosses lie about the enforceability of TRAPs. Scally was told that Petsmart wouldn't hit her for TRAP recoupment even if she quit early, provided they'd already made enough to cover the cost of her training. That was a lie.
California banned TRAPs for healthcare workers in 2020, and Colorado is poised to make it harder to TRAP workers, banning employers from forcing workers to repay standard on-the-job training expenses. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is considering a nationwide ban on TRAPs:
&lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-launches-inquiry-into-practices-that-leave-workers-indebted-to-employers/"&gt;https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-launches-inquiry-into-practices-that-leave-workers-indebted-to-employers/&lt;/a&gt;
But TRAP clauses aren't the only form of corporate indenture. Worker misclassification - where employees are falsely classed as 'independent contractors' - opens all kind of avenues for indenture. The workforce at Arise - predominantly Black women - are forced to pay cash for their own training, and fined if they quit their terrible, humiliating jobs:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/02/chickenized-by-arise/#arise"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/02/chickenized-by-arise/#arise&lt;/a&gt;
Corporate America has an infinite appetite for dreaming up new schemes to reduce worker pay and security, offloading as many business risks as possible onto workers who can be dismissed without notice or compensation. It's going to take unions - mass movements of workers - to provide the countervailing power needed to check the business lobby.

&lt;h1&gt;Justin C Key's "The World Wasn't Ready For You" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The World Wasn't Ready For You&lt;/em&gt; is Justin C Key's first book. It's a short story collection, from a major publisher. This is basically unheard of. Big publishers rarely publish collections, and when they do, it's almost always after a string of extremely successful novels:
&lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-world-wasnt-ready-for-you-justin-c-key?variant=41016598036514"&gt;https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-world-wasnt-ready-for-you-justin-c-key?variant=41016598036514&lt;/a&gt;
Yes, there are exceptions. Ted Chiang. Kelly Link.
And now, Justin C Key. To be in such company is, as they say, a big fucking deal.
I can't say I'm surprised. Key was my student at the Clarion West writing workshop - a year full of standout writers among whom Key was still a standout. I was immensely impressed with his work then, and when I found out that he was also an MD and a father, a young man juggling an unimaginably intense work and family schedule and still producing this polished, scary, &lt;em&gt;precise&lt;/em&gt; work, I knew he could have great things ahead of him.
But to be honest, I wasn't sure he &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; write. Key was so obviously brilliant and competent, and had such an important dayjob, that I could easily have imagined him deciding that making up stories was fun, but that it was not nearly so rewarding as his other vocations.
I was wrong - and right. In the years since Clarion, Key's work has acquired a kind of medical precision. When Key stabs you, the knife slides right between your ribs and goes straight into the big arteries of your heart, slicing you so quickly that you hardly notice until you are slain.
These are all horror stories, though some of them are science fiction too, and more to the point, they'r &lt;em&gt;Black&lt;/em&gt; horror stories. In his afterword, Key writes about his early fascination with horror, the catharsis he felt in watching nightmares unspool on screen or off the page. And then, he writes, came the dawning recognition that the Black characters in these stories were always there as cannon-fodder, often nameless, usually picked off early.
These stories represent Key's long rumination on the conjunction of Blackness and horror. Of course, that gets back to racism, in the way that, say, Jordan Peele's work does, or in the manner of NK Jemisin's post-Lovecraft Cthuloid tales:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/09/the-old-crow-is-getting-slow/#i-love-ny"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/09/the-old-crow-is-getting-slow/#i-love-ny&lt;/a&gt;
But "Black horror" isn't merely parables about racism. In the deft hands of these writers - and now, Key - the stories are horror in which Blackness is a &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes a central one, and that fact is ever a complication, limiting how the characters move through space, interact with authority, and relate to one another.
The eight stories - mostly long - in &lt;em&gt;The World Wasn't Ready For You&lt;/em&gt; deal with parenting, health, prison, corruption, and art - and they do so through hauntings and body horror and tension wound so tight you want to scream.
This is a brilliant and auspicious beginning from a brilliant and auspicious writer.
Key's book launches at LA's Book Soup on September 22, and I'll be there with him as interlocutor. I couldn't be more honored by this, and I hope you'll come out and see us:

&lt;h1&gt;Saturday linkdump, part the sixth (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/09/nein-nein/#everything-is-miscellaneous"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I usually write this blog 5-6 days/week, but every now and again, I take a break, and when I do, I get massive link backlogs of stuff I want to write about, but lack the time to address in depth. When that happens, I turn my Saturday edition into a linkdump. Today, I present the sixth in the series - here's the other five:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/&lt;/a&gt;
Why was I offline and away from my blog? I went to the dirt rave. Yes, I was one of the 70,000+ people stuck in the mud at this year's Burning Man, and when I emailed my editor at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; to say I might be late on the op-ed I was working on, she asked me to write about what this year's mud crisis meant:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/opinion/burning-man-flood-playa-climate-change.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/opinion/burning-man-flood-playa-climate-change.html&lt;/a&gt;
tl;dr:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad weather is normal at Burning Man (it's a feature, not a bug);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly burners leapt to the occasion, which is what people almost always do in disaster situations;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second Burning Man heavy weather year in a row;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climate emergency is tipping the Black Rock Desert from "extremely challenging" to "impossible";&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the last event, place and tradition that will have to be radically reconsidered in light of the climate emergency;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I'm home, in my hammock, with all the laundry done - just in time to leave again. I'm about to head back to my hometown of Toronto for a book launch. &lt;em&gt;The Internet Con&lt;/em&gt;, my latest nonfiction (from Verso Books) came out last week, and I'll be appearing at Another Story Bookshop on Tuesday:
&lt;a href="https://anotherstory.ca/events/29283"&gt;https://anotherstory.ca/events/29283&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Internet Con&lt;/em&gt; is a "Big Tech disassembly manual." It explains how Big Tech got so big (lax anti-monopoly enforcement, which led to regulatory capture, which let Big Tech abuse our privacy, labor rights, and consumer rights), and how we can use interoperability so it's no longer Too Big to Fail, nor Too Big to Jail:
&lt;a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/3035-the-internet-con"&gt;https://www.versobooks.com/products/3035-the-internet-con&lt;/a&gt;
You can read a long excerpt from the book in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, which lays out some of the shovel-ready legislative, regulatory and technical proposals that are the book's main purpose:
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-internet-con-cory-doctorow-book-excerpt/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/the-internet-con-cory-doctorow-book-excerpt/&lt;/a&gt;
You can also hear me read the whole introduction and first chapter of the audiobook on my podcast:
&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/internetcon/2023/08/01/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation-audiobook-outtake/"&gt;https://craphound.com/internetcon/2023/08/01/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation-audiobook-outtake/&lt;/a&gt;
That comes from the audiobook, a DRM-free, independent edition that I financed, produced and narrated myself. You can get the audiobook everywhere &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; Audible, Apple Books, and Audiobooks.com, all of which have mandatory DRM policies. You can also get it direct from me:
&lt;a href="https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/78992826/DEA0CE12/purchase"&gt;https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/78992826/DEA0CE12/purchase&lt;/a&gt;
The DRM-free ebook is available everywhere ebooks are sold (Kobo, Kindle, Nook, etc), as well as in my own DRM-free ebook store:

Now, it was inevitable that I would do a book event for &lt;em&gt;Internet Con&lt;/em&gt; in Toronto - I've never had a bad event there, and I love my hometown - but the timing of this event was driven by a non-book-related factor. Talking Heads is appearing together at TIFF, to support the re-release of Stop Making Sense, the greatest concert film in human history:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/StopMakingSense"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/StopMakingSense&lt;/a&gt;
People often ask me what my favorite book is, and I always tell them that you should never trust people who have one favorite book, as it inevitably turns out to be The Bible, &lt;em&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/em&gt;. But while I don't have a favorite book, I have a clear and unambiguous favorite &lt;em&gt;band&lt;/em&gt;.
If I was forced to listen to no music other than Talking Heads for the rest of my life, I would be perfectly happy. Ecstatic, even. Throw in David Byrne, Tom Tom Club and Casual Gods and I probably wouldn't even notice anything missing.
There's a running joke among my Burning Man campmates that whenever I'm in charge of the music, I'm just shuffling Talking Heads rarities, and whenever someone puts on anything else, I demand to know which Talking Heads album it came from. Which is all to say: &lt;em&gt;I have tickets for the Talking Heads event at TIFF and I could *not&lt;/em&gt; be more excited.*
Continuing on the Canadian theme, one of the annual highlights of Canadian media is the Massey Lectures, a series of public lectures given around the country and rebroadcast on CBC. These are always great, but recent years have been &lt;em&gt;superb&lt;/em&gt; - Ron Deibert's 2020 series was unmissable:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#citizenlab"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#citizenlab&lt;/a&gt;
This year's Masseys are shaping up to be the GOAT. They're presented by Astra Taylor, an activist rock-and-roller turned documentary filmmaker who is one of the founders of the Debt Collective, fighting for student debt cancellation. Everything Astra does is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; and her profile on CBC Ideas gives some background on the role that unschooling played in making her the powerful activist she is today:
&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/astra-taylor-interview-2023-massey-lecturer-1.6959320"&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/astra-taylor-interview-2023-massey-lecturer-1.6959320&lt;/a&gt;
There's no question that things are messed up right now, but Astra and people like her shine out like beacons of hope. 17 years ago, self-described "democracy nut" Tom Stites gave one of the seminal lectures on the role news media play in democracy:
&lt;a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/07/03/guest-posting-is-media-performance-democracys-critical-issue/"&gt;http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/07/03/guest-posting-is-media-performance-democracys-critical-issue/&lt;/a&gt;
17 years later - and from his perch as editor at the essential International Consortium of Investigative Journalists - Stites presents us a long-overdue, extremely pertinent followup: "Building Civic Energy is the Goal, Not Saving Old News Business Models":
&lt;a href="https://banyanproject.coop/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hope-College-speech-for-Banyan-website-1.pdf"&gt;https://banyanproject.coop/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hope-College-speech-for-Banyan-website-1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Stites's intervention is extremely timely, because policymakers all over the world have made the mistake of thinking that Big Tech is stealing the news media's &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;, which is absolutely untrue. It is good, actually, to index news stories and let people discuss, quote from and link to news stories. News you're not allowed to talk about isn't news, it's a &lt;em&gt;secret&lt;/em&gt;.
But Big Tech &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; stealing from news. They're not stealing content - they're stealing &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;. The Google/Apple duopoly rakes 30% off every subscription payment collected in an app. The Google/Meta duopoly rakes 51% out of every ad-dollar (and maintain that death-grip through creepy, privacy-invading surveillance ads). Meta and Twitter hold social media subscribers hostage, forcing publishers to pay to reach &lt;em&gt;their own subscribers&lt;/em&gt;.
We don't want the news to be Big Tech's &lt;em&gt;partners&lt;/em&gt; - we need them to be Big Tech's &lt;em&gt;watchdogs&lt;/em&gt;. "Link taxes" and other profit-sharing arrangements between the media and tech cut against the civic energy Stites wants to build.
(You can read more about this - along with policy prescriptions for halting Big Tech's rent-extraction from the news - in "Saving the News From Big Tech," my EFF white-paper:)
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/saving-news-big-tech"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/saving-news-big-tech&lt;/a&gt;
If your spirits are lifted by stories of principled activists achieving important - and improbable - victories, you could do worse than to attend the EFF Awards on in San Francisco Sept 14 (I'm the emcee). This year, we're honoring Alexandra Elbakyan for her founding of Sci-Hub, the Library Freedom Project and the Signal Foundation:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/awards/effawards/2023"&gt;https://www.eff.org/awards/effawards/2023&lt;/a&gt;
In more activist news: Mozilla produced a startling and astoundingly good - if demoralizing - report on the state of digital privacy and security in the automotive sector:
&lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/"&gt;https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/&lt;/a&gt;
Entitled, "It’s Official: Cars Are the Worst Product Category We Have Ever Reviewed for Privacy," the report reveals just how &lt;em&gt;absolutely terrible&lt;/em&gt; the automotive sector is when it comes to privacy practices, collecting (and selling) (and giving away) information about your sex life, your genealogy, your genetic characteristics, and your &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt; (no, seriously).
Their recommendations for which new car you should buy boil down to "don't buy a new car." I have been urging consumer research groups to release a report like this for a &lt;em&gt;decade&lt;/em&gt;. There are whole categories of gadgets - like, say, "smart speakers" - that are unsafe at any speed. At a certain point, reviewers need to have the guts to say that every manufacturer in an entire sector is a dumpster fire and they should all be dragged in front of a firing squad - or at least a Congressional committee.
Cars, after all, are nightmares of privacy invasion and rent-extraction, the source of autoenshittification on a massive scale, a mobile form of technofeudalism:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon&lt;/a&gt;
The fact that cars score so badly on privacy is especially ironic given the campaign Big Car waged against the 2020 Massachusetts Right to Repair ballot initiative, in which car manufacturers held themselves out as the &lt;em&gt;defenders&lt;/em&gt; of driver privacy from unscrupulous third parties who couldn't be trusted to handle the vast troves of data your car collects with every hour that God sends:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms&lt;/a&gt;
This is a familiar refrain: monopolists often claim that any check on their absolute authority over their users will expose those users to privacy risks. Apple has run a global ad-campaign claiming this, and while Apple &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; prevent Facebook from spying on iPhone owners, they also secretly spy on those customers in exactly the same way that Facebook used to, and lie about it:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar&lt;/a&gt;
It turns out that giant companies just aren't good proxies for their customers' interests, and that the power they amass through monopolization shouldn't be counted on as a source of user safety. Monopolists won't reliably defend user privacy - that job belongs to democratically accountable regulators. That's an argument I developed in detail with Bennett Cyphers in our EFF white-paper "Privacy Without Monopoly":
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/interoperability-and-privacy"&gt;https://www.eff.org/wp/interoperability-and-privacy&lt;/a&gt;
That is, rather than getting privacy by "voting with your wallet," you need to get it by voting with your &lt;em&gt;ballot&lt;/em&gt;. "The market" is an election that you vote in with dollars, which means that the people with the most dollars always win. When there are &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; cars on the market that are safe to drive, you can't vote with your wallet by buying a good one.
On a related subject, the DOJ Antitrust Division has brought the most important tech anti-monopoly case of the century, charging Google with monopolizing search:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/technology/modern-internet-first-monopoly-trial-us-google-dominance.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/technology/modern-internet-first-monopoly-trial-us-google-dominance.html&lt;/a&gt;
Part of the DOJ case turns on the fact that Google goes to &lt;em&gt;extraordinary&lt;/em&gt; lengths to keep you from ever &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; another search engine, paying out more than &lt;em&gt;$45 billion every year&lt;/em&gt; to be the default search on every device, program and service you might use. In other words, Google spends entire &lt;em&gt;Twitter's&lt;/em&gt; worth of dollars every year, lighting it on fire to keep you from finding out about rivals.
Google argues that this is fine, actually, because these are only &lt;em&gt;defaults&lt;/em&gt;, and users can dig through their settings to change their search engine. Sure, Google - and the first 20 search results you serve are only &lt;em&gt;defaults&lt;/em&gt;, and it wouldn't matter if you were ordered to put them ten screens down, because users could always scroll to see them.
But search defaults aren't the only way that Google locks in searchers - and then harms us by invading our privacy. Google's ubiquitous Chrome browser ties Google's search to Google's invasive, nonconsensual, total surveillance. Chrome turned 15 this year and Google made a huge PR splash out of the anniversary:
&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-new-features-redesign-2023/"&gt;https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-new-features-redesign-2023/&lt;/a&gt;
But all that puffery conspicuously failed to mention that Google had quietly rolled out its long-discredited, new surveillance technology, FLOC, which it pretended to kill in 2021:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/22/ihor-kolomoisky/#not-that-competition"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/22/ihor-kolomoisky/#not-that-competition&lt;/a&gt;
FLOC is back, rebranded as the Topics API: this is a system for spying on you so advertisers can target you. Google is spinning this as a privacy &lt;em&gt;improvement&lt;/em&gt; because it might someday replace "third party cookies," one of the creepiest web surveillance systems.
But as Ron Amadeo writes for &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;, Chrome is the last major browser to support third party cookies - both Safari and Firefox block them by default. So Google is basically saying, "We are going to improve your privacy by changing how we spy on you, even though all our competitors don't do this kind of spying &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;":
&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/googles-widely-opposed-ad-platform-the-privacy-sandbox-launches-in-chrome/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/googles-widely-opposed-ad-platform-the-privacy-sandbox-launches-in-chrome/&lt;/a&gt;
This kind of gaslighting, where Google pisses in all our mouths and tells us it's raining, is the hallmark of a decrepit, arrogant, crapulent monopolist that needs to be shattered in the courts. Kudos to the DoJ for doing the people's business here - and kudos to DoJ antitrust boss Jonathan Kanter for promising that he will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go into corporate law when he finishes his stint in government.
The DoJ isn't the only public agency that's serving the American people. The FCC just announced proceedings to force cybersecurity labels for "smart" devices:
&lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices"&gt;https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices&lt;/a&gt;
This is long overdue, and it's a welcome action from the FCC, which was hamstrung for years because cowardly Democratic senators joined with homophobic, libelous Republicans in blocking confirmation hearings for the amazing Gigi Sohn:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/15/useful-idiotsuseful-idiots/#unrequited-love"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/15/useful-idiotsuseful-idiots/#unrequited-love&lt;/a&gt;
After years of abuse, Sohn bowed out. Now, Anna Gomez has been confirmed to fill that fifth FCC chair, turning the FCC into a fully operational battle station:
&lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/senate-votes-approve-anna-gomez-5th-fcc-commissioner"&gt;https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/senate-votes-approve-anna-gomez-5th-fcc-commissioner&lt;/a&gt;
The fact that there's all this great stuff going on in the administrative branch is easy to lose sight of amidst the circus of federal electoral politics, in which Donald Trump has retained his role as ringmaster and chief distractor.
Thankfully, we have expert Pantsless Emperor skewerers like Ruben Bolling around - his latest Tom the Dancing Bug revives his brilliant Calvin and Hobbes-inspired Trump gag:

I usually write this blog 5-6 days/week, but every now and again, I take a break, and when I do, I get massive link backlogs of stuff I want to write about, but lack the time to address in depth. When that happens, I turn my Saturday edition into a linkdump. Today, I present the sixth in the series - here's the other five:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/&lt;/a&gt;
Why was I offline and away from my blog? I went to the dirt rave. Yes, I was one of the 70,000+ people stuck in the mud at this year's Burning Man, and when I emailed my editor at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; to say I might be late on the op-ed I was working on, she asked me to write about what this year's mud crisis meant:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/opinion/burning-man-flood-playa-climate-change.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/opinion/burning-man-flood-playa-climate-change.html&lt;/a&gt;
tl;dr:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad weather is normal at Burning Man (it's a feature, not a bug);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly burners leapt to the occasion, which is what people almost always do in disaster situations;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second Burning Man heavy weather year in a row;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climate emergency is tipping the Black Rock Desert from "extremely challenging" to "impossible";&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the last event, place and tradition that will have to be radically reconsidered in light of the climate emergency;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I'm home, in my hammock, with all the laundry done - just in time to leave again. I'm about to head back to my hometown of Toronto for a book launch. &lt;em&gt;The Internet Con&lt;/em&gt;, my latest nonfiction (from Verso Books) came out last week, and I'll be appearing at Another Story Bookshop on Tuesday:
&lt;a href="https://anotherstory.ca/events/29283"&gt;https://anotherstory.ca/events/29283&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Internet Con&lt;/em&gt; is a "Big Tech disassembly manual." It explains how Big Tech got so big (lax anti-monopoly enforcement, which led to regulatory capture, which let Big Tech abuse our privacy, labor rights, and consumer rights), and how we can use interoperability so it's no longer Too Big to Fail, nor Too Big to Jail:
&lt;a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/3035-the-internet-con"&gt;https://www.versobooks.com/products/3035-the-internet-con&lt;/a&gt;
You can read a long excerpt from the book in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, which lays out some of the shovel-ready legislative, regulatory and technical proposals that are the book's main purpose:
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-internet-con-cory-doctorow-book-excerpt/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/the-internet-con-cory-doctorow-book-excerpt/&lt;/a&gt;
You can also hear me read the whole introduction and first chapter of the audiobook on my podcast:
&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/internetcon/2023/08/01/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation-audiobook-outtake/"&gt;https://craphound.com/internetcon/2023/08/01/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation-audiobook-outtake/&lt;/a&gt;
That comes from the audiobook, a DRM-free, independent edition that I financed, produced and narrated myself. You can get the audiobook everywhere &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; Audible, Apple Books, and Audiobooks.com, all of which have mandatory DRM policies. You can also get it direct from me:
&lt;a href="https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/78992826/DEA0CE12/purchase"&gt;https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/78992826/DEA0CE12/purchase&lt;/a&gt;
The DRM-free ebook is available everywhere ebooks are sold (Kobo, Kindle, Nook, etc), as well as in my own DRM-free ebook store:
&lt;a href="https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/78992801/9C4FC2B8/purchase"&gt;https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/78992801/9C4FC2B8/purchase&lt;/a&gt;
Verso's books are sold in bookstores around the world; you can support your local bookseller by buying it through Bookshop:

Now, it was inevitable that I would do a book event for &lt;em&gt;Internet Con&lt;/em&gt; in Toronto - I've never had a bad event there, and I love my hometown - but the timing of this event was driven by a non-book-related factor. Talking Heads is appearing together at TIFF, to support the re-release of Stop Making Sense, the greatest concert film in human history:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/StopMakingSense"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/StopMakingSense&lt;/a&gt;
People often ask me what my favorite book is, and I always tell them that you should never trust people who have one favorite book, as it inevitably turns out to be The Bible, &lt;em&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/em&gt;. But while I don't have a favorite book, I have a clear and unambiguous favorite &lt;em&gt;band&lt;/em&gt;.
If I was forced to listen to no music other than Talking Heads for the rest of my life, I would be perfectly happy. Ecstatic, even. Throw in David Byrne, Tom Tom Club and Casual Gods and I probably wouldn't even notice anything missing.
There's a running joke among my Burning Man campmates that whenever I'm in charge of the music, I'm just shuffling Talking Heads rarities, and whenever someone puts on anything else, I demand to know which Talking Heads album it came from. Which is all to say: &lt;em&gt;I have tickets for the Talking Heads event at TIFF and I could *not&lt;/em&gt; be more excited.*
Continuing on the Canadian theme, one of the annual highlights of Canadian media is the Massey Lectures, a series of public lectures given around the country and rebroadcast on CBC. These are always great, but recent years have been &lt;em&gt;superb&lt;/em&gt; - Ron Deibert's 2020 series was unmissable:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#citizenlab"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#citizenlab&lt;/a&gt;
This year's Masseys are shaping up to be the GOAT. They're presented by Astra Taylor, an activist rock-and-roller turned documentary filmmaker who is one of the founders of the Debt Collective, fighting for student debt cancellation. Everything Astra does is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; and her profile on CBC Ideas gives some background on the role that unschooling played in making her the powerful activist she is today:
&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/astra-taylor-interview-2023-massey-lecturer-1.6959320"&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/astra-taylor-interview-2023-massey-lecturer-1.6959320&lt;/a&gt;
There's no question that things are messed up right now, but Astra and people like her shine out like beacons of hope. 17 years ago, self-described "democracy nut" Tom Stites gave one of the seminal lectures on the role news media play in democracy:
&lt;a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/07/03/guest-posting-is-media-performance-democracys-critical-issue/"&gt;http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/07/03/guest-posting-is-media-performance-democracys-critical-issue/&lt;/a&gt;
17 years later - and from his perch as editor at the essential International Consortium of Investigative Journalists - Stites presents us a long-overdue, extremely pertinent followup: "Building Civic Energy is the Goal, Not Saving Old News Business Models":
&lt;a href="https://banyanproject.coop/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hope-College-speech-for-Banyan-website-1.pdf"&gt;https://banyanproject.coop/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hope-College-speech-for-Banyan-website-1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Stites's intervention is extremely timely, because policymakers all over the world have made the mistake of thinking that Big Tech is stealing the news media's &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;, which is absolutely untrue. It is good, actually, to index news stories and let people discuss, quote from and link to news stories. News you're not allowed to talk about isn't news, it's a &lt;em&gt;secret&lt;/em&gt;.
But Big Tech &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; stealing from news. They're not stealing content - they're stealing &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;. The Google/Apple duopoly rakes 30% off every subscription payment collected in an app. The Google/Meta duopoly rakes 51% out of every ad-dollar (and maintain that death-grip through creepy, privacy-invading surveillance ads). Meta and Twitter hold social media subscribers hostage, forcing publishers to pay to reach &lt;em&gt;their own subscribers&lt;/em&gt;.
We don't want the news to be Big Tech's &lt;em&gt;partners&lt;/em&gt; - we need them to be Big Tech's &lt;em&gt;watchdogs&lt;/em&gt;. "Link taxes" and other profit-sharing arrangements between the media and tech cut against the civic energy Stites wants to build.
(You can read more about this - along with policy prescriptions for halting Big Tech's rent-extraction from the news - in "Saving the News From Big Tech," my EFF white-paper:)
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/saving-news-big-tech"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/saving-news-big-tech&lt;/a&gt;
If your spirits are lifted by stories of principled activists achieving important - and improbable - victories, you could do worse than to attend the EFF Awards on in San Francisco Sept 14 (I'm the emcee). This year, we're honoring Alexandra Elbakyan for her founding of Sci-Hub, the Library Freedom Project and the Signal Foundation:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/awards/effawards/2023"&gt;https://www.eff.org/awards/effawards/2023&lt;/a&gt;
In more activist news: Mozilla produced a startling and astoundingly good - if demoralizing - report on the state of digital privacy and security in the automotive sector:
&lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/"&gt;https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/&lt;/a&gt;
Entitled, "It’s Official: Cars Are the Worst Product Category We Have Ever Reviewed for Privacy," the report reveals just how &lt;em&gt;absolutely terrible&lt;/em&gt; the automotive sector is when it comes to privacy practices, collecting (and selling) (and giving away) information about your sex life, your geneology, your genetic characteristics, and your &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt; (no, seriously).
Their recommendations for which new car you should buy boil down to "don't buy a new car." I have been urging consumer research groups to release a report like this for a &lt;em&gt;decade&lt;/em&gt;. There are whole categories of gadgets - like, say, "smart speakers" - that are unsafe at any speed. At a certain point, reviewers need to have the guts to say that every manufacturer in an entire sector is a dumpster fire and they should all be dragged in front of a firing squad - or at least a Congressional committee.
Cars, after all, are nightmares of privacy invasion and rent-extraction, the source of autoenshittification on a massive scale, a mobile form of technofeudalism:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon&lt;/a&gt;
The fact that cars score so badly on privacy is especially ironic given the campaign Big Car waged against the 2020 Massachusetts Right to Repair ballot initiative, in which car manufacturers held themselves out as the &lt;em&gt;defenders&lt;/em&gt; of driver privacy from unscrupulous third parties who couldn't be trusted to handle the vast troves of data your car collects with every hour that God sends:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms&lt;/a&gt;
This is a familiar refrain: monopolists often claim that any check on their absolute authority over their users will expose those users to privacy risks. Apple has run a global ad-campaign claiming this, and while Apple &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; prevent Facebook from spying on iPhone owners, they also secretly spy on those customers in exactly the same way that Facebook used to, and lie about it:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar&lt;/a&gt;
It turns out that giant companies just aren't good proxies for their customers' interests, and that the power they amass through monopolization shouldn't be counted on as a source of user safety. Monopolists won't reliably defend user privacy - that job belongs to democratically accountable regulators. That's an argument I developed in detail with Bennett Cyphers in our EFF white-paper "Privacy Without Monopoly":
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/interoperability-and-privacy"&gt;https://www.eff.org/wp/interoperability-and-privacy&lt;/a&gt;
That is, rather than getting privacy by "voting with your wallet," you need to get it by voting with your &lt;em&gt;ballot&lt;/em&gt;. "The market" is an election that you vote in with dollars, which means that the people with the most dollars always win. When there are &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; cars on the market that are safe to drive, you can't vote with your wallet by buying a good one.
On a related subject, the DOJ Antitrust Division has brought the most important tech anti-monopoly case of the century, charging Google with monopolizing search:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/technology/modern-internet-first-monopoly-trial-us-google-dominance.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/technology/modern-internet-first-monopoly-trial-us-google-dominance.html&lt;/a&gt;
Part of the DOJ case turns on the fact that Google goes to &lt;em&gt;extraordinary&lt;/em&gt; lengths to keep you from every &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; another search engine, paying out more than &lt;em&gt;$45 billion every year&lt;/em&gt; to be the default search on every device, program and service you might use. In other words, Google spends entire &lt;em&gt;Twitter's&lt;/em&gt; worth of dollars every year, lighting it on fire to keep you from finding out about rivals.
Google argues that this is fine, actually, because these are only &lt;em&gt;defaults&lt;/em&gt;, and users can dig through their settings to change their search engine. Sure, Google - and the first 20 search results you serve are only &lt;em&gt;defaults&lt;/em&gt;, and it wouldn't matter if you were ordered to put them ten screens down, because users could always scroll to see them.
But search defaults aren't the only way that Google locks in searchers - and then harms us by invading our privacy. Google's ubiquitous Chrome browser ties Google's search to Google's invasive, nonconsensual, total surveillance. Chrome turned 15 this year and Google made a huge PR splash out of the anniversary:
&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-new-features-redesign-2023/"&gt;https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-new-features-redesign-2023/&lt;/a&gt;
But all that puffery conspicuously failed to mention that Google had quietly rolled out its long-discredited, new surveillance technology, FLOC, which it pretended to kill in 2021:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/22/ihor-kolomoisky/#not-that-competition"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/22/ihor-kolomoisky/#not-that-competition&lt;/a&gt;
FLOC is back, rebranded as the Topics API: this is a system for spying on you so advertisers can target you. Google is spinning this as a privacy &lt;em&gt;improvement&lt;/em&gt; because it might someday replace "third party cookies," one of the creepiest web surveillance systems.
But as Ron Amadeo writes for &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;, Chrome is the last major browser to support third party cookies - both Safari and Firefox block them by default. So Google is basically saying, "We are going to improve your privacy by changing how we spy on you, even though all our competitors don't do this kind of spying &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;":
&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/googles-widely-opposed-ad-platform-the-privacy-sandbox-launches-in-chrome/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/googles-widely-opposed-ad-platform-the-privacy-sandbox-launches-in-chrome/&lt;/a&gt;
This kind of gaslighting, where Google pisses in all our mouths and tells us it's raining, is the hallmark of a decrepit, arrogant, crapulent monopolist that needs to be shattered in the courts. Kudos to the DoJ for doing the people's business here - and kudos to DoJ antitrust boss Jonathan Kanter for promising that he will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go into corporate law when he finishes his stint in government.
The DoJ isn't the only public agency that's serving the American people. The FCC just announced proceedings to force cybersecurity labels for "smart" devices:
&lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices"&gt;https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices&lt;/a&gt;
This is long overdue, and it's a welcome action from the FCC, which was hamstrung for years because cowardly Democratic senators joined with homophobic, libelous Republicans in blocking confirmation hearings for the amazing Gigi Sohn:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/15/useful-idiotsuseful-idiots/#unrequited-love"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/15/useful-idiotsuseful-idiots/#unrequited-love&lt;/a&gt;
After years of abuse, Sohn bowed out. Now, Anna Gomez has been confirmed to fill that fifth FCC chair, turning the FCC into a fully operational battle station:
&lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/senate-votes-approve-anna-gomez-5th-fcc-commissioner"&gt;https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/senate-votes-approve-anna-gomez-5th-fcc-commissioner&lt;/a&gt;
The fact that there's all this great stuff going on in the administrative branch is easy to lose sight of amidst the circus of federal electoral politics, in which Donald Trump has retained his role as ringmaster and chief distractor.
Thankfully, we have expert Pantsless Emperor skewerers like Ruben Bolling around - his latest Tom the Dancing Bug revives his brilliant Calvin and Hobbes-inspired Trump gag:
&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2023/09/06/tom-the-dancing-bug-a-calvinesque-and-hobbesian-look-at-taking-a-mug-shot.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2023/09/06/tom-the-dancing-bug-a-calvinesque-and-hobbesian-look-at-taking-a-mug-shot.html&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;EU v FB (vg!) (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/24/russian-roulette/#do-not-consent"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Like all walled gardens, Facebook doesn't have users, it has hostages - but it also has prey. Even if you don't have a FB account (and especially if you do), FB tracks you across the web and through your apps, thanks to Like buttons, FB pixels and other trackers.
A German court just ordered them to knock that shit off.
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html&lt;/a&gt;
Last year, the German competition regulator ruled FB was breaking the law when it collected data using non-FB websites and apps. FB appealed to Germany's highest court, which just ruled against them.
The Federal Court of Justice ordered FB to change how it processes user-data, and to allow people (including those without FB accounts) to choose not to be followed around the web and through their apps.
FB has vowed to fight, though the lower court that punted the question up to the top court is almost certain to rubberstamp the decision. FB might take the decision to the EUCJ, Europe's top court, but that's quite a gamble, given recent ruling from that court.
In the meantime, FB is making no changes to its illegal nonconsensual tracking conduct, slow-walking compliance with the order until the very last second.
You can block FB data-collection on the web with Privacy Badger, EFF's tracker-blocker.
&lt;a href="https://privacybadger.org/"&gt;https://privacybadger.org/&lt;/a&gt;
But when it comes to keeping FB out of your pocket distraction rectangle, you're basically fucked. Neither of the mobile OS duopolists have given you adequate tools to keep FB from following you around, even if you don't have the FB app.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/aoc-primary-challenge.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AOC wins (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/24/russian-roulette/#aoc-aoc-aoc"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
NY14 is a Democratic safe-seat, meaning whomever gets the Democratic nomination there automatically ends up in Congress. In 2018, AOC trounced Joe Crowley, a 10-term, banker-lovin' DINO who was thought to be unassailable.
NY just had 2020 primaries, and AOC a primary challenge: Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former registered Republican who hates Medicare and Social Security, and whose campaign raised vast sums from private equity looters and other garbage people.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/16/new-old-apples/#aoc-not-mcc"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/16/new-old-apples/#aoc-not-mcc&lt;/a&gt;
Choosing Caruso-Cabrera as their standard bearer was a spectacular act of contempt and hubris on the part of the finance sector. Not only did she not articulate a single policy (!), but she has a history of writing books calling for the abolition of the Department of Labor!
Other gems from her literary oeuvre: a demand for &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; offshore tax-havens: "Freedom and democracy are best secured when banking secrecy and tax havens exist."
Contrast this with AOC's brilliant performance in shredding finance industry criminals in Congress!
The finance industry truly made the primary race a referendum on plutocracy, impunity, inequality and corruption...
...And they lost.
Badly.
&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/aoc-primary-challenger-michelle-caruso-cabrera-8b2ed6c1-3aaf-4fdf-ab8c-4d33b3e1b1b6.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;amp;utm;_medium=social&amp;amp;amp;utm;_campaign=onhrs"&gt;https://www.axios.com/aoc-primary-challenger-michelle-caruso-cabrera-8b2ed6c1-3aaf-4fdf-ab8c-4d33b3e1b1b6.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;amp;utm;_medium=social&amp;amp;amp;utm;_campaign=onhrs&lt;/a&gt;
Despite being grossly outspent and outgunned, AOC slaughtered Caruso-Cabrera at the polls.
&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/aoc-primary-challenger-michelle-caruso-cabrera-8b2ed6c1-3aaf-4fdf-ab8c-4d33b3e1b1b6.html"&gt;https://www.axios.com/aoc-primary-challenger-michelle-caruso-cabrera-8b2ed6c1-3aaf-4fdf-ab8c-4d33b3e1b1b6.html&lt;/a&gt;
The victory tells us two things about the current moment:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time of plutocratic rule is coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plutes do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; understand that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/covidLas_Vegas_Sign_Nightly.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Vegas casino workers beg for their lives (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/24/russian-roulette/#snake-eyes"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Las Vegas was one of the first US cities to re-open and it was among the most aggressive, thanks largely to its idiot mayor Carolyn Goodman, who says businesses should make up their own protocols and the market will decide what's adequate.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/23/riot-baby/#carolyn-goodman"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/23/riot-baby/#carolyn-goodman&lt;/a&gt;
Goodman: "I am not a private owner. That's the competition in this country. The free enterprise and to be able to make sure that what you offer the public meets the needs of the public."
&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/22/politics/las-vegas-mayor-social-distancing-cnntv/index.html"&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/22/politics/las-vegas-mayor-social-distancing-cnntv/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
You will never guess what happened next.
As cases rise in Nevada, casino workers are "begging" gamblers to put on a fucking mask - reportedly only 10% are doing so.
(No language on Earth contains the phrase "As prudent as an habitual gambler")
&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/las-vegas-casino-workers-urge-guests-to-wear-masks-as-nevada-cases-rise_n_5ef24911c5b663ecc854770f"&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/las-vegas-casino-workers-urge-guests-to-wear-masks-as-nevada-cases-rise_n_5ef24911c5b663ecc854770f&lt;/a&gt;
The state Casino Board has only mandated masks for games whose tables require players to be in close proximity, again, relying on the caution and sound statistical reasoning of people who throw their life's savings into pseudorandom-number generators.

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;a name="cda230"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/cda-230.png"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;You are wrong about CDA 230 (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/24/russian-roulette/#cda230"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is probably the worst-understood - and most important - internet regulations, and the confusion's only gotten worse since Trump signed a legally incoherent executive order purporting to reform it.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/30/up-is-not-down/#cda230"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/30/up-is-not-down/#cda230&lt;/a&gt;
Under CDA 230, responsibility for bad speech acts (libel, obscenity, etc) rests on the speaker, not the host. FB isn't legally responsible for what its users post, but it IS responsible for what its employees and execs post.
A bunch of well-meaning people who hate things that I hate - racism, harassment, etc - have been calling for CDA 230 reform to fight this. I think they're well-intentioned, but dangerously wrong.
Big Tech is terrible at moderation. Forcing them to do more will not make them better at it. Instead, we'll get more kangaroo courts,  powerful people who hire moderation-policy experts can silence their victims while harassing them with impunity.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/17/on-face-interaction/#content-moderation-at-scale"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/17/on-face-interaction/#content-moderation-at-scale&lt;/a&gt;
Right on cue, far-right assholes have weaponized the right's victim-complex to join forces with progressives who want to dismantle CDA 230, in a bid to force a "fairness doctrine" on tech companies that will favor whoever has the most resources.
I get exhausted just thinking about this stupid, stupid stuff. But one person who's been absolutely rock-solid in handing out fact-based rebuttals to it is Mike Masnick.
Now, he's posted "Hello! You've Been Referred Here Because You're Wrong About Section 230 Of The Communications Decency Act," which breaks down every one of the bad arguments made by CDA 230 opponents.
&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200531/23325444617/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act.shtml"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200531/23325444617/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act.shtml&lt;/a&gt;
(It's a riff on Ken White's canonical "Hello! You've Been Referred Here Because You're Wrong About The First Amendment.)
&lt;a href="https://www.popehat.com/2016/06/11/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-the-first-amendment/"&gt;https://www.popehat.com/2016/06/11/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-the-first-amendment/&lt;/a&gt;
Here's the myths Masnick busts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Once a company like that starts moderating content, it's no longer a platform, but a publisher"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of Section 230, websites have no incentive to moderate!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Section 230 is a massive gift to big tech!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A site that has political bias is not neutral, and thus loses its Section 230 protections"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Section 230 requires all moderation to be in 'good faith' and this moderation is 'biased' so you don't get 230 protections"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Section 230 is why there's hate speech online..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Section 230 means these companies can never be sued!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Section 230 is a get out of jail card for websites!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Section 230 is why there's piracy online"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Section 230 gives websites blanket immunity!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Section 230 is why big internet companies are so big!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Section 230 was designed to encourage websites to be neutral common carriers"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If all this stuff is actually protected by the 1st Amendment, then we can just get rid of Section 230"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I get why you might have heard someone say this stuff and assumed they were right. Normally, reading statutes is a hard slog and we have to rely on experts to interpret the laws for us.
But while there's a lot of caselaw around CDA 230 (Masnick's got links), the actual statute is remarkably short, punchy and clear. You can and should read it for yourself, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if you're going to opine about what it means.

My latest podcast is a reading of the author's note from "Attack Surface" -- the third Little Brother book, which comes out on Oct 12.
&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757531"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757531&lt;/a&gt;
I recorded this for the audiobook edition of Attack Suface, which I've been recording all last week with Amber Benson and the Cassandra de Cuir from Skyboat Media.

&lt;h1&gt;Trump admits voter suppression (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/31/reality-endorses-sanders/#voter-suppression"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Trump went on Fox and Friends to talk about switching the 2020 election to mail-in, and said, that if you allowed everyone to vote, "you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again."
Jon Queally calls it "Saying the quiet part out loud."
&lt;a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/30/saying-quiet-part-very-loud-trump-admits-youd-never-have-republican-elected-country"&gt;https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/30/saying-quiet-part-very-loud-trump-admits-youd-never-have-republican-elected-country&lt;/a&gt;
It's a pretty consequential slip, though. Trump was discussing the GOPs opposition to providing funding to states to retool for postal voting, which is likely to result in high-stakes litigation. And courtrooms - even ones presided over by GOP appointees - take these frank admissions of intent to heart.
Just look at the weird tale of Thomas Hofeller, creator of REDMAP and architect of the GOP's nationwide gerrymandering campaign.
Hofeller's key insight was the redistricting was "an election in reverse" where, "instead of voters choosing their politicians, politicians choose their voters." He convinced GOP donors that funding state-level gerrymanders was a huge bargain on political influence.
We know what happened next: the US became more antimajoritarian than ever and started to elect antimajoritarian politicians - politicians who embrace the core right-wing tenet that some people are better than others and those people should be in charge.
White nationalists want whites in charge. Dominionists want rule by Christian men. Libertarians want rule by bosses. But they all believe that nature made some to rule and others to be ruled.
This is a hard ideology to make work in a democracy, which is notionally a majoritarian project. To get elected, antimajoritarians have two main tactics.
The first is scapegoating. White supremacy is how the GOP gets turkeys to vote for Christmas:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#turkey-shoot"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#turkey-shoot&lt;/a&gt;
LBJ's Southern Strategy was remarkably frank about this: "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you."
Right now, the GOP and its state media organ, Fox, have opted to put its main base (old white people) into harm's way by converting high-risk activity into a marker of tribal loyalty. They could kill of a LOT of their base. It's a weird flex.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/19/gb-whatsapp/#fox-cult"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/19/gb-whatsapp/#fox-cult&lt;/a&gt;
But then there's the other antimajoritarian way to win: cheating (i.e. gerrymandering), which brings me back to Hoeffler.
Hoeffler was really careful about never saying the quiet part out loud.
Not only did he never admit he was gerrymandering on racial lines, he also exhorted his allies to never write down anything like this, not to send emails or make notes to themselves about it.
But Hoeffler wasn't good at following his own advice. When he died suddenly in 2018, he left behind computers and thumb-drives stuffed with frank admissions that REDMAP was a cheat, designed to steal the votes of nonwhites and other traditional Democratic voters.
Worse (for Hoeffler and the GOP), the person who inherited his data was his estranged, anarchist daughter, Stephanie. She put all that data online:
&lt;a href="https://archive.syndicate.si/hofeller/"&gt;https://archive.syndicate.si/hofeller/&lt;/a&gt;
She dumped it all in raw form, so no one could accuse her of putting Hoeffler's deeds and intentions in a false negative light -- it's all there, including materials that reflect badly on Stephanie. She was more interested in truth than her own feelings.
Before Stephanie doxed her father, court cases over REDMAP gerrymandering had been stalled and nosediving. Afterwards courts - presided over by GOP-appointed judges - had no choice but to find in favor of the plaintiffs, against GOP redistricting.
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pked4v/the-anarchist-daughter-of-the-gops-gerrymandering-mastermind-just-dumped-all-his-maps-and-files-on-google-drive"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pked4v/the-anarchist-daughter-of-the-gops-gerrymandering-mastermind-just-dumped-all-his-maps-and-files-on-google-drive&lt;/a&gt;
Proving intent is key to prevailing in court challenges to redistricting and other election fuckery. It's really hard. The bar is set incredibly high. If the redistricters can make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sort of claim of a legit purpose for the new boundaries, they usually win.
But not when they come right out and say the quiet part out loud. When the President goes on &lt;em&gt;national television&lt;/em&gt; and announces that he wants fewer people to vote because otherwise, "you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again," well...
Both figuratively and literally, Trump has a really hard time keeping it in his pants. He &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; says the quiet part out loud from "rapists and drug traffickers" to his statement that he would withhold aid from states whose governors criticized him.
He's really good at running across the river hopping from the back of one alligator to the next before the jaws snap closed, but that's a strategy much better suited to owning the news cycle than the courtroom.
Because courts don't lose focus when your outlandish deeds are chased by more outlandish ones, obliterating the previous scandal from the public mind. They are deliberative, slow, plodding.
Remorseless.
Remember when Trump's Muslim ban got struck down because courts weighed his statement that it wasn't a Muslim ban against his tweets where he said it was? Saying the quiet part out loud is good antimajoritarian electioneering. It's a terrible legal strategy.
Running across a river on the back of alligators works great...until it doesn't. It's hard to keep running once you lose a leg.
Trump no longer has a leg to stand on.

From Medicare for All to public broadband provision to reining in pharma to the need for worker rights to universal housing, pandemics have an incredibly unfair left-wing bias.
SF and LA can order shelter-in-place, but that doesn't magically end the plague of homelessness that was created by allowing the private sector to decide which housing got built and where.
Quarantine's incompatibility with mass incarceration is indisputable.
A nation without savings cannot survive a pandemic unchanged.
History tells us what those changes can be: the New Deal, the GI Bill, the Great Society.
We're balanced on the knife edge between two futures. In the first one, pandemic leads to fascist exterminism, the belief that poors and spoonies and olds need to be eliminated to ensure that they don't become reservoirs of pathogens.
In the second, the manifest failures of the cruel doctrine of "personal responsibility" is displaced by solidarity and the frank admission that we have a shared destiny, not just economic or social, but microbial.
We get to choose. Soon. As soon as November.

&lt;h1&gt;Amazon fires walkout organizer (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/31/reality-endorses-sanders/#instacart-wholefoods-amazon"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Amazon warehouse workers and other low-waged workers who are literally keeping us and our economy alive during the pandemic say that their employers are cutting corners, depriving them of PPE, handwashing, sick pay, etc.
It's especially bad at Amazon warehouses, where workers have staged walkouts to protest unsafe working conditions.
The walkout at Staten Island's JFK8 warehouse was led by Chris Smalls, who has been fired by Amazon.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/amazon-fires-staten-island-coronavirus-strike-leader-chris-smalls.html"&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/amazon-fires-staten-island-coronavirus-strike-leader-chris-smalls.html&lt;/a&gt;
Amazon claims that Smalls was fired for failing to observe social distancing. Read between the lines and you'll discover that they sent him home because he was a labor leader and insisted that he stay there, using epidemiology as a pretence for illegal labor practices.
Workers at Whole Foods are ready to walk out too:
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-amazon-whole-foods-strike/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-amazon-whole-foods-strike/&lt;/a&gt;
And Instacart:
&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/whole-foods-workers-to-strike-after-amazon-instacart-employees-walk-out"&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/whole-foods-workers-to-strike-after-amazon-instacart-employees-walk-out&lt;/a&gt;
It's funny, you'd think the right would be all over this. After all, the excuse for paying low-waged workers substarvation wages is that the market has set their wage there, because other people are willing to do their jobs if they don't want to.
And now, no one is willing to do those jobs, so they have a seller's market. When you have a seller's market, capitalists tell you that you should demand all the market will bear. In this case, I think that comes out to sick pay, PPE, and a giant fucking raise.

&lt;h1&gt;Monopolists stole your respirator (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/31/reality-endorses-sanders/#covidien"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
A couple days ago, I wrote about how lax antitrust enfforcement caused America's ventilator shortage, because medtech giant Covidien bought out tiny rival Newport to kill a USG contract to produce tons of low-cost ventilators.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#market-oxygen"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/30/medtronic-stole-your-ventilator/#market-oxygen&lt;/a&gt;
I based that post off this excellent NYT piece, which gets deep on history of the plan to produce the ventilators, and the way that Covidien killed it, and then got acquired by an even bigger company, Medtronic (who were already a horrible shithow).
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html&lt;/a&gt;
But there's even more to the story, as David Dayen writes in The American Prospect.
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-covidien-story-corporate-america-ventilators/"&gt;https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-covidien-story-corporate-america-ventilators/&lt;/a&gt;
The whole story is even more of a parable about late-stage capitalism than it appears at first blush.
First of all, this kind of buy-and-kill maneuver is an epidemic in the health industries. This paper identifies 45 instances per year in which pharma companies acquire small competitors to prevent the release of low-cost competitors to their products:
&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3241707"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3241707&lt;/a&gt;
For example: Roche killed a promising hemophilia cure from small rival Spark Therapeutics, whose one-shot drug would have ended the market for Roche's once-a-month hemophilia drug Hemlibra.
Then there's Covidien's acquisition by Medtronic, which wasn't an acquisition in the traditional sense, rather, it was a "tax inversion" -- a piece of financial engineering -- that allowed Medtronic to move $1B in offshore money to the US tax free.
&lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/economy/article/In-Medtronic-s-deal-for-Covidien-an-emphasis-on-5557271.php"&gt;https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/economy/article/In-Medtronic-s-deal-for-Covidien-an-emphasis-on-5557271.php&lt;/a&gt;
Covidien had a long history of financial shenanigans, dating back to its years as a division of Tyco International, whose CEO was imprisoned for fraud. Covidien has variously billed itself as a US, Bermudan and Irish company.
tldr: "Covidien, a longtime corporate tax cheat and serial acquirer of competitors, scooped up a rival and scotched its most promising project, which would have significantly boosted our ability to cope with pandemics. Then it merged with an even bigger rival and lent it the same tax avoidance and corporate consolidation tactics, making the medical supply chain even more fragile."

https://xkcd.com/2287/
There are real risks associated with anthropomorphizing the virus - it can feed conspiracism and xenophobia - but Randall's work at describing the public health to the pandemic from the virus's perspective is just incredibly heartening and also compelling.
What a sweet moment for your day, to imagine how your sacrifices are frustrating the virus, and simultaneously to get a rigorous, easy-to-grasp description of how social distancing and other countermeasures work. Randall Munroe is a human treasure.

&lt;h1&gt;Demonopolizing the internet with interoperability (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/24/comcom-acm/#cacm"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery has just published my editorial, "Competitive Compatibility: Let's Fix the Internet, Not the Tech Giants," explaining how interoperability was once an engine for competition and user empowerment - and how that ended.
&lt;a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/10/255710-competitive-compatibility/fulltext"&gt;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/10/255710-competitive-compatibility/fulltext&lt;/a&gt;
As the title suggests, regulators are fed up with Big Tech's abuses, but they're not sure what to do about it. One approach is to "fix the companies" - like forcing Facebook to fight "disinformation" or making Google filter all user content for suspected copyright violations.
The problem with this approach is that it's not clear whether the tech companies &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; solve these problems (for example, no copyright filter can distinguish between permitted uses like parody or commentary and infringing ones).
A rule that requires Big Tech to throw everything at unsolvable problems will make the cost of entry into the tech sector so expensive that Big Tech will get to rule unchallenged, forever. And the problems &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; won't get solved.
There's another approach, though - rather than fixing tech companies, we can fix the internet. We can empower communities and individuals to escape monopoly platforms, through interoperability.
If you don't like how FB moderates its platform, interop would let you leave - and still stay connected to the family, community and customers you leave behind.
My article sets out a taxonomy of interoperability:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooperative: When you interoperate through an API or a standard (like web browsers and servers)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indifferent: When a company takes no steps to help or block interop (like when you plug a USB adapter into a car lighter)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adversarial: Interop against the wishes of the interoper-ee, overcoming whatever defenses they put up to prevent interop. This has a long and honorable tradition - Apple reverse-engineering Microsoft Office for Iwork, say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That adversarial interoperability (we call it "competitive compatibility" or comcom at EFF) is the stick to standardization's carrot.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability&lt;/a&gt;
Dominant companies may not like having third parties plug into their stuff to give their customers more freedom, but if it IS going to happen, they'd much prefer a managed system of standards to techno-guerrilla warfare with reverse-engineers, botmasters and scrapers.
Unfortunately, the rise of monopoly tech platforms has concentrated power in the hands of a small number of execs whose companies have near-infinite cash to spend on lobbying against adversarial interoperability.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/starve-beast-monopoly-power-and-political-corruption"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/starve-beast-monopoly-power-and-political-corruption&lt;/a&gt;
The Big Tech cartel's members all owe their existence to comcom, but like the pirate who becomes an admiral, they are all committed to preventing upstarts from doing unto them as they did unto others when they were new on the scene.
The problem with Big Tech isn't just that they're wildly imperfect - it's that they're wildly imperfect &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they've rigged the system to make it painful for you to go somewhere better. Interop lowers the "switching costs" that hold you hostage.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs&lt;/a&gt;
Fixing the tech companies won't work. The problem isn't just that Mark Zuckerberg is unfit to be the unelected, perpetual lifestyle czar of 3 billion people - it's that &lt;em&gt;no one should have that job&lt;/em&gt;.
That's why, in addition to all the antitrust remedies that trustbusters have wielded against abusive monopolists for more than a century, we need modern tools - like interoperability. Bills like the ACCESS Act will get us part of the way:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/new-access-act-good-start-heres-how-make-sure-it-delivers"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/new-access-act-good-start-heres-how-make-sure-it-delivers&lt;/a&gt;
But it's not enough to mandate that Big Tech open up its interfaces - we also have to empower users and the toolsmiths who serve them to connect to dominant platforms in the ways that serve users, not corporate shareholders.

&lt;h1&gt;Email sabbaticals (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#email-sabbatical"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
It's been a decade since danah boyd introduced me to the idea of "email sabbaticals." That's when you go away and turn off your email.
&lt;a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html"&gt;http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html&lt;/a&gt;
Not just setting an out-of-office message, but rather deleting all inbound mail and asking correspondents to try again after the break. In her message, boyd explains to those correspondents who know how to reach her mother that this is the only way to reach her.
Here's the rationale: if you allow email to pile up while you're trying to unwind, it'll take months to catch up on when you get back, and you'll immediately burn out, incinerating all the value you got out of your break.
What's more, you'll still fail to clear the backlog - you'll have to declare "email bankruptcy" and fail everyone who'd contacted you anyway. It's a bad deal for you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; for the people who email you during your break.
Here's how boyd's email sabbaticals work: six months prior, she informs her collaborators that she'll be taking some protracted downtime; a month before she confirms her commitments to collaborators and composes a checklist to ensure that she meets them prior to departure.
A week in advance, she warns everyone again that she's going offline and shuttering her inboxes. Close family members and her network administrator are given instructions for reaching her while on break, but no one else is.
She leaves, and shuts down her email. She knows she's going to miss new, time-sensitive stuff, but makes peace with it. In return, she gets the peace of mind that comes from knowing that she's going to come home to an empty in-box.
At the close of business today, I'm going on email (and work) sabbatical until Jan 4, 2021. Apart from one live event (the remote Chaos Communications Congress on Dec 27) I won't be accepting emails and I won't be replying to DMs or other messages.
&lt;a href="https://rc3.world/"&gt;https://rc3.world/&lt;/a&gt;
I really, really need it.
Over the years, many people have expressed their admiration at my "productivity" - but the dirty secret of that productivity is that work is how I cope with stress.
It's not the worst problem to have: I wrote a whole novel since the crisis, while also launching four books and keeping up with my day-job at EFF.
But working to cope with stress has its limits. It's a good temporary fix, but it's no long-term solution.
For one thing, I've got a serious, untreatable, degenerating chronic pain condition, and working is how I hope with the pain, too - distraction works far better than any prescription meds for me.
But ignoring your body's pain signals is a dangerous tactic. It's why I'm now experiencing the worst continuous pain of my adult life (it's been a stressful year). Last week it was so bad I was walking with a cane.
I say all of this not to humblebrag about my commitment to my work, but rather in the interests of transparency. I'm keenly aware that we live our own blooper reels and everyone else's highlight reels.
I'm grateful for my work habits, truly - but they come at a really high cost, and balancing work-as-distraction and work-as-pathology is really, really hard. If you're wondering how to do what I do, have a little peek into the blooper reel, first.
It's been a high-stress, crazy year. We nearly went broke, then had a spectacular recovery (thank you, Kickstarter backers!), have tried our best to be good parents (with varying degrees of success). We've gone through blazing rows and many sleepless nights.
I've spent most of the year with sores at the corners of my mouth, which I only get under in the most extreme times of stress.
And we've had it &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. We're solvent, safe, and healthy. Thinking about what this would be like if any of those changed is terrifying.
Hanging out with my digital community is a huge net benefit to me, but unplugging from that community is something I increasingly value as I head towards my 50th birthday next July.
My first digital community experience was sending IMs to other users of the timeshare mainframe we plugged into when I was six years old, in 1977, when my dad brought home an acoustic coupler and my mom found 1,000' of brown paper towel to feed into the teletype.
Some (most) of my life's most important relationships, friendships, and discussions have taken place over this medium, and an enormous amount of that good stuff started with a conversation with a stranger.
I never felt the outrage that attended the introduction of the telephone into Edwardian England: "Anyone -- any wild fool off the street -- could simply barge bellowing into one's office or home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell."
&lt;a href="https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html"&gt;https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html&lt;/a&gt;
For me, finding my people (and being found by them) has been the highlight of my half-century. Touring and speaking turned these digital relationships into personal ones.
But: moderation in all things. I'm writing four of these threads this morning, doing a couple interviews and meetings, and then putting my lid down until 2021 (save for a brief dial-in to CCC on the 27th).
I'm going to swim in our lovely outdoor public pool, which, thankfully, has figured out how to remain open during the pandemic. I'm going read in the backyard hammock and hike in Griffith Park.
I'm not going to answer - or accept - email while I'm gone.
And I say all of this because it's taken a decade for me to really understand what danah was getting at (she's a very smart person and I often benefit from reflecting on our conversations).
And also, to show you a bit of the blooper reel. Coping strategies are great and necessary, but they're no substitute for addressing the underlying problems. I'm proud of the work I do, but I'm also still learning how to do it right.

&lt;h1&gt;Chaos Communications Congress (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#rc3"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I'm about to go offline until 2021 and I had planned to do &lt;em&gt;absolutely no work of any sort&lt;/em&gt; while on break, but I made an exception, for an exceptional opportunity: the 32nd Chaos Communications Congress, which is remote this year.
&lt;a href="https://rc3.world/"&gt;https://rc3.world/&lt;/a&gt;
CCC is - notoriously - held during Christmas week, which means that the attendees are limited to people who either care about tech policy and security more than their families, or people who can talk their families into coming along.
It's one of the best events I've ever attended (I brought my family along). My talk at that event, "The Coming War on General Purpose Computing," has had a long afterlife, in large part because of the kind and thoughtful reactions of the attendees.
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg&lt;/a&gt;
I've been trying to get back ever since but haven't managed it - until this year. RC3 (the first all-remote CCC) has invited me to speak on Dec 27.
I'm doing two back-to-back events: a talk called "What the cyberoptimists got wrong - and what to do about it" then a "fireside chat" (a reading from my book ATTACK SURFACE followed by a Q&amp;amp;A;).
They're back-to-back, starting at 10AM Pacific (7PM CET) and running to 12/9PM.
The tickets are currently sold out, but they've mooted releasing another block. If you're attending, I hope you'll consider tuning into my talk (and of course, as with all CCC talks, these will be online shortly thereafter for public viewing).

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/HandsomeVariableGalapagosalbatross-max-1mb.gif"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Landmark US financial transparency law (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#financial-secrecy"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, Swissleaks, Luxembourg Leaks, the Fincen Files - the past decade has been filled with financial secrecy scandals wherein we learned how the world's worst people hide the world's dirtiest money.
Governments have fallen as a result of these leaks. Journalists have been murdered for reporting them, whistleblowers have been imprisoned for telling the truth. These are a high-stakes window on the corruption, self-dealing and viciousness of the 1% and their criminal pals.
One critical revelation is the role that "onshort-offshore" plays in money-laundering: rich countries with a reputation for a strong rule of law and good governance are the lynchpin of global financial secrecy, thanks to lax corporate enforcement.
Money laundering, tax-evasion, bribery and other finance crimes were only possible because places like New Zealand, the City of London, Scotland, and US tax-havens like Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming knowingly abetted them.
Anti-financial-secrecy campaigners have made major progress in shutting down onshore-offshore havens, and now they've scored a massive victory in the USA, with the inclusion of an anti-money-laundering amendment to the defense bill.
&lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/advocates-celebrate-major-us-anti-money-laundering-victory/"&gt;https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/advocates-celebrate-major-us-anti-money-laundering-victory/&lt;/a&gt;
It's a must-pass bill, and there's always intense jockeying to attach other legislation to it, virtually guaranteeing its passage (this is not always a good thing: Trump wants terrible, dangerous changes to internet law included in the bill):
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/its-not-section-230-president-trump-hates-its-first-amendment"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/its-not-section-230-president-trump-hates-its-first-amendment&lt;/a&gt;
The Corporate Transparency Act requires that all US companies report their true owners to the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen). This will make Fincen investigations vastly cheaper...and more effective.
It's got strong bipartisan support, and is the culmination of a decade of debate, consultation and coalition-building. It passed the House and Senate with a nominally veto-proof majority.
That doesn't mean it will pass. Trump has threatened to veto it, and many GOP lickspittles in both houses have vowed to back the president if he overturns their vote.
Even if that happens, it seems likely that the Corporate Transparency Act will pass as standalone legislation - its support comes from all quarters, from the Chamber of Commerce to Friends of the Earth, from Transparency International to Dow Chemicals.

&lt;h1&gt;Rogues' Galleries and facial recognition (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/16/fraught-superpowers/#fr"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Cities - and even states - across the USA have passed laws banning the use of facial recognition technology by governments; the most-often cited concern is surveillance and its ability to chill lawful conduct like protests.
But as my EFF colleague Matthew Guariglia writes for Slate Future Tense, the risks run deeper than that, as historic debates have shown us. The early 20th century saw debates over "rogues galleries" (police files of photos of criminals and suspects).
&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/rogues-gallery-facial-recognition-technology-history.html"&gt;https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/rogues-gallery-facial-recognition-technology-history.html&lt;/a&gt;
As Guariglia writes, "Suspicion is a circular process." In theory you got put into a Rogues Gallery because you were suspicious. In practice, being in a Rogues Gallery &lt;em&gt;made you&lt;/em&gt; suspicious. A single photo taken after a single police encounter turned into an eternal accusation.
It meant your innocence would be called into question every time a crime was committed, with cops walking through a Rogues Gallery to find their likeliest suspects. An officer's decision to haul you in - often due to overt or unconscious bias - meant a lifetime of suspicion.
In 1899 Jacob "Doc" Owens - a cheating gambler - went to the NY Supreme Court to have his picture taken out of the NYC Rogues Gallery. He failed, but the national debate he spurred never died down.
In 1909, 19 year old George B Duffy was arrested for robbery in NYC. It was a bullshit charge, later reduced by the embarrassed NYPD to "obstructing the sidewalk."
Duffy's father began campaigning to have his face removed from the Rogues Gallery.
The campaign sparked national press coverage deploring the eternal suspicion cast over those who had a bad interaction with a cop. NYC's mayor overrode the police commissioner, had the photo destroyed, and demanded the commissioner's resignation.
These debates echo through the decade, as we fight over facial recognition: "while people no longer laugh and sneer at people whose faces hang in the police station, they can be denied jobs or passports because of misreadings or misunderstandings buried in hoarded data."
Guariglia: "the fundamental and historical truth is that face recognition means we are all constantly under suspicion. We’re all in the rogues’ gallery now."

1998's Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act extended US copyrights by 20 years to life-plus-70 for human authors and 95 years total for corporate authors. The extension was retrospective, so works in the public domain went back into copyright.
This was a wanton act of violence that doomed much of our culture to disappear entirely before its copyright expired, allowing it to be used and revitalized, rewoven into our cultural fabric.
It was undertaken to extract extra revenues for the minuscule fraction of works by long-dead authors that were still generating revenues. It also froze the US public domain for two decades, with no work re-entering our public domain until Jan 1 2018.
That day - the Grand Reopening of the Public Domain - marked the entry of the collected works of 1923 into the public domain. Last Jan saw the liberation of 1924's catalog:
&lt;a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/12/13/the-public-domain-line-is-moving-again-one-year-later/"&gt;https://blog.archive.org/2019/12/13/the-public-domain-line-is-moving-again-one-year-later/&lt;/a&gt;
And now, it's about to happen again. Every year, Duke University's James Boyle and Jennifer Jenkins document the treasures we are about to receive. 1925 is a bumper crop:

We're getting The Great Gatsby &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Fats Waller; Woolf's Mrs Galloway and Hemingway's In Our Time; we're getting the Harlem Renaissance's peak, and the first year of The New Yorker. It's a good year!
(yeah, Mein Kampf is in there too)
Here's some highlights from the list:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Dos Passos, Manhattan Transfer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alain Locke, The New Negro (collecting works from writers including W.E.B. du Bois, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, and Eric Walrond)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair Lewis, Arrowsmith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agatha Christie, The Secret of Chimneys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aldous Huxley, Those Barren Leaves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Merry Widow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buster Keaton’s Go West&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always, by Irving Berlin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet Georgia Brown, by Ben Bernie, Maceo Pinkard &amp;amp; Kenneth Casey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by ‘Jelly Roll’ Morton, including Shreveport Stomps and Milenberg Joys (with Paul Mares, Walter Melrose, &amp;amp; Leon Roppolo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by Duke Ellington, including Jig Walk and With You (both with Joseph “Jo” Trent)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by ‘Fats’ Waller, including Anybody Here Want To Try My Cabbage (with Andrea “Andy” Razaf), Ball and Chain Blues (with Andrea “Andy” Razaf), and Campmeetin’ Stomp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by Bessie Smith, the “Empress of the Blues,” including Dixie Flyer Blues, Tired of Voting Blues, and Telephone Blues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works by Sidney Bechet, including Waltz of Love (with Spencer Williams), Naggin’ at Me (with Rousseau Simmons), and Dreams of To-morrow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these works and more will be available at Internet Archive on Jan 1. Get ready!

I'm not American. For the first half of my life, my touchstone for Jul 4 was the Schoolhouse Rock "Fireworks" segment that leaked over the border from Buffalo through Fox 29's UHF signal.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/schoolhousefireworksanimation.gif" /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZYyY7g8g4"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZYyY7g8g4&lt;/a&gt;
When it came to how Americans had observed Jul 4 through history, my impressions came from whitewashed pop culture like Disney's Carousel of Progress:
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/carousseljul4animation.gif" /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo4jnlvJmrk"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo4jnlvJmrk&lt;/a&gt;
All that changed when I discovered Frederick Douglass's 1852 "What to the Slave Is the 4th of July?" - such a stirring piece of rhetoric that it practically leaps off the page.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/03/monument-toppling-season/#all-countries-matter"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/03/monument-toppling-season/#all-countries-matter&lt;/a&gt;
Today's Public Domain Review embeds the Internet Archive's gorgeous scan of the original 1852 pamphlet that was sold through Frederick Douglass' Paper (AKA The North Star) and to the attendees in Rochester's Corinthian Hall on that fateful night.
&lt;a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/frederick-douglass-fourth-july-speech"&gt;https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/frederick-douglass-fourth-july-speech&lt;/a&gt;
Beyond that, the Review provides some much-needed context for the 19th Century Black experience of Jul 4, and the rival holiday, Jul 5, which commemorated the full abolishment of slavery in New York in 1827.
The speech's original title highlights the two holidays' divergence: "What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July?" Jul 4 celebrations - and other public observances - were often accompanied by drunken white mobs attacking Black people and Black-owned businesses.
Black Americans celebrated Jul 5 with parades in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and elsewhere.
Douglass refused to give his speech on the 4th and instead gave it on the 5th, to a full house of 600 mostly white abolitionists, who bought 700+ copies of the pamphlet afterward.
Douglass labored over the speech for weeks and afterward wrote to an abolitionist to say that he thought it had gone over well. You can read the plain text of the speech here:

&lt;h1&gt;Why they're smearing Lina Khan (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/14/making-good-trouble/#the-peoples-champion"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
My god, they sure &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; Lina Khan. This once-in-a-generation, groundbreaking, brilliant legal scholar and fighter for the public interest, the slayer of Reaganomics, has attracted more vitriol, mockery, and dismissal than any of her predecessors in living memory.
She sure must be doing something right, huh?
A quick refresher. In 2017, Khan - then a law student - published &lt;em&gt;Amazon's Antitrust Paradox&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Yale Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;. It was a brilliant, blistering analysis showing how the Reagan-era theory of antitrust (which celebrates monopolies as "efficient") had failed on its own terms, using Amazon as Exhibit A of the ways in which post-Reagan antitrust had left Americans vulnerable to corporate abuse:
&lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox&lt;/a&gt;
The paper sent seismic shocks through both legal and economic circles, and goosed the neo-Brandeisian movement (sneeringly dismissed as "hipster antitrust"). This movement is a rebuke to Reaganomics, with its celebration of monopolies, trickle-down, offshoring, corporate dark money, revolving-door regulatory capture, and companies that are simultaneously too big to fail and too big to jail.
This movement has many proponents, of course - not just Khan - but Khan's careful scholarship, combined with her encyclopedic knowledge of the long-dormant statutory powers that federal agencies had to make change, and a strategy for reviving those powers to protect Americans from corporate predators made her a powerful, inspirational figure.
When Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, he surprised everyone by appointing Khan to the FTC. It wasn't just that she had such a radical vision - it was also that she lacked the usual corporate law experience that such an appointee would normally require (experience that would ensure that the FTC was helmed by people whose default view of the world is that it should be structured and regulated by powerful, wealthy people in corporate boardrooms).
Even more surprising was that Khan was made &lt;em&gt;chair&lt;/em&gt; of the FTC, something that was only possible because a few Republican Senators broke with their party to support her candidacy:
&lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1171/vote_117_1_00233.htm"&gt;https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1171/vote_117_1_00233.htm&lt;/a&gt;
These Republicans saw in Khan an ally in their fight against "woke" Big Tech. For these senators, the problem wasn't that tech had got too big and powerful - it was that there were a few limited instances in which tech leaders failed to wield that power in the ways they preferred.
The Republican project is a matter of getting turkeys to vote for Christmas by doing a lot of culture war bullshit, cruelly abusing disfavored sexual and racial minorities. This wins support from low-information voters who'll vote against their class interests and support more monopolies, more tax cuts for the rich, and more cuts to the services they rely on.
But while tech leaders are 100% committed to the project of permanent oligarchic takeover of every sphere of American life, they are less full-throated in their support for hateful, cruel discrimination against disfavored minorities (in this regard, tech leaders resemble the corporate wing of the Democrats, which is where we get the "Silicon Valley is a Democratic Party stronghold" narrative).
This failure to unquestioningly and unstintingly back culture war bullshit put tech leaders in the GOP's crosshairs. Some GOP politicians actually believe in the culture war bullshit, and are grossly offended that tech is "woke." Others are smart enough not to get high on their own supply, but worry that any tech obstruction in the bullshit culture wars will make it harder to get sufficient turkey votes for a big fat Christmas surprise.
Biden's ceding of antitrust policy to the left wing of the party, combined with disaffected GOP senators viewing Khan as their enemy's enemy, led to Khan's historic appointment as FTC Chair. In that position, she was joined by a slate of Biden trustbusters, including Jonathan Kanter at the DoJ Antitrust Division, Tim Wu at the White House, and other important, skilled and principled fighters like Alvaro Bedoya (FTC), Rebecca Slaughter (FTC), Rohit Chopra (CFPB), and many others.
Crucially, these new appointees weren't just principled, they were &lt;em&gt;good at their jobs&lt;/em&gt;. In 2021, Tim Wu wrote an executive order for Biden that laid out 72 concrete ways in which the administration could act - with no further Congressional authorization - to blunt corporate power and insulate the American people from oligarchs' abusive and extractive practices:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down&lt;/a&gt;
Since then, the antitrust arm of the Biden administration have been &lt;em&gt;fuckin' ninjas&lt;/em&gt;, Getting Shit Done in ways large and small, working - for the first time since Reagan - to protect Americans from predatory businesses:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/18/administrative-competence/#i-know-stuff"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/18/administrative-competence/#i-know-stuff&lt;/a&gt;
This is in marked contrast to the corporate Dems' champions in the administration. People like Pete Buttigieg are heralded as competent
technocrats, "realists" who are too principled to peddle hopium to the base, writing checks they can't cash. All this is cover for a King Log performance, in which Buttigieg's far-reaching regulatory authority sits unused on a shelf while a million Americans are stranded over Christmas and whole towns are endangered by greedy, reckless rail barons straight out of the Gilded Age:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge&lt;/a&gt;
The contrast between the Biden trustbusters and their counterparts from the corporate wing is stark. While the corporate wing insists that every pitch is out of the zone, Khan and her allies are swinging for the stands. They're trying to make life better for you and me, by declaring commercial surveillance to be an unfair business practice and thus illegal:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/12/regulatory-uncapture/#conscious-uncoupling"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/12/regulatory-uncapture/#conscious-uncoupling&lt;/a&gt;
And by declaring noncompete "agreements" that shackle good workers to shitty jobs to be illegal:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#neofeudal"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#neofeudal&lt;/a&gt;
And naturally, this has &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; pissed off all the right people: America's billionaires and their cheerleaders in the press, government, and the hive of scum and villainy that is the Big Law/thinktank industrial-complex.
Take the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;: since Khan took office, they have published &lt;em&gt;67 vicious editorials&lt;/em&gt; attacking her and her policies. Khan is living rent-free in Rupert Murdoch's head. Not only that, he's given her the presidential suite! You &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to see it.
These attacks are worth reading, if only to see how flimsy and frivolous they are. One major subgenre is that Khan shouldn't be bringing any action against Amazon, because her groundbreaking scholarship about the company means she has a conflict of interest. Holy &lt;em&gt;moly&lt;/em&gt; is this a stupid thing to say. The idea that the chair of an expert agency should recuse herself &lt;em&gt;because she is an expert&lt;/em&gt; is what the physicists call &lt;em&gt;not even wrong.&lt;/em&gt;
But these attacks are even more laughable due to who they're coming from: people who have the most outrageous conflicts of interest imaginable, and who were conspicuously silent for years as the FTC's revolving door admitted a bestiary of swamp-creatures so conflicted it's a wonder they managed to dress themselves in the morning.
Writing in &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, David Dayen runs the numbers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Since the late 1990s, 31 out of 41 top FTC officials worked directly for a company that has business before the agency, with 26 of them related to the technology industry.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-06-23-attacks-lina-khans-ethics-reveal-projection/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/2023-06-23-attacks-lina-khans-ethics-reveal-projection/&lt;/a&gt;
Take Christine Wilson, a GOP-appointed FTC Commissioner who quit the agency in a huff because Khan wanted to do things for the American people, and not their self-appointed oligarchic princelings. Wilson wrote an angry break-up letter to Khan that the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; published, presaging their concierge service for Samuel Alito:
&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-im-resigning-from-the-ftc-commissioner-ftc-lina-khan-regulation-rule-violation-antitrust-339f115d"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-im-resigning-from-the-ftc-commissioner-ftc-lina-khan-regulation-rule-violation-antitrust-339f115d&lt;/a&gt;
For Wilson to question Khan's ethics took galactic-scale chutzpah. Wilson, after all, is a commissioner who took cash money from Bristol-Myers Squibb, then voted to approve their merger with Celgene:
&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4365601-Wilson-Christine-Smith-final278.html"&gt;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4365601-Wilson-Christine-Smith-final278.html&lt;/a&gt;
Or take Wilson's GOP FTC predecessor Josh Wright, whose incestuous relationship with the companies he oversaw at the Commission are so intimate he's practically got a Habsburg jaw. Wright went from Google to the US government and back again &lt;em&gt;four times&lt;/em&gt;. He also lobbied the FTC on behalf of Qualcomm (a major donor to Wright's employer, George Mason’s Antonin Scalia Law School) after working "personally and substantially" while serving at the FTC.
George Mason's Scalia center practically &lt;em&gt;owns&lt;/em&gt; the revolving door, counting &lt;em&gt;fourteen&lt;/em&gt; FTC officials among its affliates:

Since the 1990s, 31 out of 41 top FTC officials - both GOP appointed and appointees backed by corporate Dems - "worked directly for a company that has business before the agency":

The &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; of FTC and DoJ antitrust lawyers who served between 2014-21 left government service and went straight to work for a Big Law firm, serving the companies they'd regulated just a few months before:
&lt;a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Revolving-Door-In-Federal-Antitrust-Enforcement.pdf"&gt;https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Revolving-Door-In-Federal-Antitrust-Enforcement.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Take Deborah Feinstein, formerly the head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, now a partner at Arnold &amp;amp; Porter, where she's represented General Electric, NBCUniversal, Unilever, and Pepsi and a whole medicine chest's worth of pharma giants before her former subordinates at the FTC. Michael Moiseyev who was assistant manager of FTC Competition is now in charge of mergers at Weil Gotshal &amp;amp; Manges, working for Microsoft, Meta, and Eli Lilly.
There's a whole bunch more, but Dayen reserves special notice for Andrew Smith, Trump's FTC Consumer Protection boss. Before he was put on the public payroll, Smith represented &lt;em&gt;120 clients&lt;/em&gt; that had business before the Commission, including "nearly every major bank in America, drug industry lobbyist PhRMA, Uber, Equifax, Amazon, Facebook, Verizon, and a variety of payday lenders":

Before Khan, in other words, the FTC was a "conflict-of-interest assembly line, moving through corporate lawyers and industry hangers-on without resistance for decades."
Khan is the first FTC head with no conflicts. This leaves her opponents in the sweaty, desperate position of inventing conflicts out of thin air.
For these corporate lickspittles, Khan's "conflict" is that she has a &lt;em&gt;point of view&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, she thinks that the FTC should do its job.
This makes grifters like Jim Jordan furious. Yesterday, Jordan grilled Khan in a hearing where he accused her of violating an ethics official's advice that she should recuse herself from Big Tech cases. This is a talking point that was created and promoted by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-16/ftc-rejected-ethics-advice-for-khan-recusal-on-meta-case"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-16/ftc-rejected-ethics-advice-for-khan-recusal-on-meta-case&lt;/a&gt;
That ethics official, Lorielle Pankey, did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, in fact, make this recommendation. It's simply untrue (she &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; say that Khan presiding over cases that she has made public statements about could be used as ammo against her, but did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; say that it violated any ethical standard).
But there's more to this story. Pankey herself has a &lt;em&gt;gigantic&lt;/em&gt; conflict of interest in this case, including a stock portfolio with between $15,001 and $50,000 in Meta stock (Meta is another company that has whined in print and in its briefs that it is a poor defenseless lamb being picked on by big, mean ole Lina Khan):
&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ethics-official-owned-meta-stock-while-recommending-ftc-chair-recuse-herself-from-meta-case-8582a83b"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ethics-official-owned-meta-stock-while-recommending-ftc-chair-recuse-herself-from-meta-case-8582a83b&lt;/a&gt;
Jordan called his hearing on the back of this fake scandal, and then proceeded to show his whole damned ass, even as his GOP colleagues got into a substantive and even informative dialog with Khan:
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/power/2023-07-14-jim-jordan-misfires-attacks-lina-khan/"&gt;https://prospect.org/power/2023-07-14-jim-jordan-misfires-attacks-lina-khan/&lt;/a&gt;
Mostly what came out of that hearing was news about how Khan is doing her job, working on behalf of the American people. For example, she confirmed that she's investigating OpenAI for nonconsensually harvesting a mountain of Americans' personal information:
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8ce04d67-069b-4c9d-91bf-11649f5adc74"&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/8ce04d67-069b-4c9d-91bf-11649f5adc74&lt;/a&gt;
Other Republicans, including confirmed swamp creatures like Matt Gaetz, ended up agreeing with Khan that Amazon Ring is a privacy dumpster-fire. Nobodies like Rep Tom Massie gave Khan an opening to discuss how her agency is protecting mom-and-pop grocers from giant, price-gouging, greedflation-drunk national chains. Jeff Van Drew gave her a chance to talk about the FTC's war on robocalls. Lance Gooden let her talk about her fight against horse doping.
But Khan's opponents did manage to repeat a lot of the smears against her, and not just the bogus conflict-of-interest story. They also accused her of being 0-4 in her actions to block mergers, ignoring the &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; number of mergers that have been called off or not initiated &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; M&amp;amp;A professionals now understand they can no longer expect these mergers to be waved through. Indeed, just last night I spoke with a friend who owns a medium-sized tech company that Meta tried to buy out, only to withdraw from the deal because their lawyers told them it would get challenged at the FTC, with an uncertain outcome.
These talking points got picked up by people commenting on Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley's ruling against the FTC in the Microsoft-Activision merger. The FTC was seeking an injunction against the merger, and Corley turned them down flat. The ruling was objectively &lt;em&gt;very bad&lt;/em&gt;. Start with the fact that Corley's son is a Microsoft employee who stands reap massive gains in his stock options if the merger goes through.
But beyond this (real, non-imaginary, not manufactured conflict of interest), Corley's judgment and her remarks in court were &lt;em&gt;inexcusably&lt;/em&gt; bad, as Matt Stoller writes:
&lt;a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/judge-rules-for-microsoft-mergers"&gt;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/judge-rules-for-microsoft-mergers&lt;/a&gt;
In her ruling, Corley explained that she didn't think Microsoft would abuse the market dominance they'd gain by merging their giant videogame platform and studio with one of its largest competitors. Why not? Because Microsoft's execs pinky-swore that they wouldn't abuse that power.
Corely's deference to Microsoft's corporate priorities goes deeper than trusting its execs, though. In denying the FTC's motion, she stated that it would be unfair to put the merger on hold in order to have a full investigation into its competition implications because Microsoft and Activision had set a deadline of July 18 to conclude things, and Microsoft would have to pay a penalty if that deadline passed.
This is surreal: a judge ruled that a corporation's radical, massive merger shouldn't be subject to full investigation because that corporation itself set an arbitrary deadline to conclude the deal before such an investigation could be concluded. That's pretty convenient for future mega-mergers - just set a short deadline and Judge Corely will tell regulators that the merger can't be investigated because the deadline is looming.
And this is all about the future. As Stoller writes, Microsoft isn't exactly subtle about why it wants this merger. Its own execs said that the reason they were spending "dump trucks" of money buying games studios was to "spend Sony out of business."
Now, maybe you hate Sony. Maybe you hate Activision. There's plenty of good reason to hate both - they're run by creeps who do shitty things to gamers and to their employees. But if you think that &lt;em&gt;Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; will be better once it eliminates its competition, then you have the attention span of a goldfish on Adderall.
Microsoft made &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same promises it made on Activision when it bought out another games studio, Zenimax - and it broke every one of those promises.
Microsoft has a long, long, &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; history of being a brutal, abusive monopolist. It is a &lt;em&gt;convicted&lt;/em&gt; monopolist. And its bad conduct didn't end with the browser wars. You remember how the lockdown turned all our homes into rent-free branch offices for our employers? Microsoft seized on that moment to offer our bosses keystroke-and-click level surveillance of our use of our own computers in our own homes, via its Office365 bossware product:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge&lt;/a&gt;
If you think a company that gave your boss a tool to spy on their employees and rank them by "productivity" as a prelude to firing them or cutting their pay is going to treat gamers or game makers well once they have "spent the competition out of business," you're a credulous sucker and you are gonna be &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; disappointed.
The enshittification play is obvious: use investor cash to make things temporarily nice for customers and suppliers, lock both of them in - in this case, it's with a subscription-based service similar to Netflix's - and then claw all that value back until all that's left is a big pile of shit.
The Microsoft case is about the future. Judge Corely doesn't take the future seriously: as she said during the trial, "All of this is for a shooter videogame." The reason Corely greenlit this merger isn't because it won't be harmful - it's because she doesn't think those harms matter.
But it does, and not just because games are an art form that generate billions of dollars, employ a vast workforce, and bring pleasure to millions. It also matters because this is yet another one of the Reaganomic precedents that tacitly endorses monopolies as efficient forces for good. As Stoller writes, Corley's ruling means that "deal bankers are sharpening pencils and saying ‘Great, the government lost! We can get mergers through everywhere else.’ Basically, if you like your high medical prices, you should be cheering on Microsoft’s win today."
Ronald Reagan's antitrust has colonized our brains so thoroughly that commentators were surprised when, immediately after the ruling, the FTC filed an appeal. &lt;em&gt;Don't they know they've lost?&lt;/em&gt; the commentators said:
&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ftc-files-appeal-of-microsoft-activision-deal-ruling-1850640159"&gt;https://gizmodo.com/ftc-files-appeal-of-microsoft-activision-deal-ruling-1850640159&lt;/a&gt;
They echoed the smug words of insufferable Activision boss Mike Ybarra: "Your tax dollars at work."
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1679277251337277440"&gt;https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1679277251337277440&lt;/a&gt;
But &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; Khan is appealing. The only reason that's surprising is that Khan is working for us, the American people, not the giant corporations the FTC is supposed to be defending us from. Sure, I get that this is a major change! But she needs our backing, not our cheap cynicism.
The business lobby and their pathetic Renfields have hoarded all the nice things and they don't want us to have any. Khan and her trustbuster colleagues want the opposite. There is no measure so small that the corporate world won't have a conniption over it. Take click to cancel, the FTC's perfectly reasonable proposal that if you sign up for a recurring payment subscription with a single click, you should be able to cancel it with a single click.
The tooth-gnashing and garment-rending and scenery-chewing over this is &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;. America's biggest companies have wheeled out their biggest guns, claiming that if they make it too easy to unsubscribe, they will lose money. In other words, they are &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; making money not because people want their products, but because it's too hard to stop paying for them!
&lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/12/ftc_cancel_subscriptions/"&gt;https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/12/ftc_cancel_subscriptions/&lt;/a&gt;
We shouldn't have to tolerate this sleaze. And if we back Khan and her team, they'll protect us from these scams. Don't let them convince you to give up hope. This is the start of the fight, not the end. We're trying to reverse 40 years' worth of Reagonmics here. It won't happen overnight. There will be setbacks. But keep your eyes on the prize - this is the most exciting moment for countering corporate power and giving it back to the people in my lifetime. We owe it to ourselves, our kids and our planet to fight one.

&lt;h1&gt;Fincen (they fucking knew all along) (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/21/too-big-to-jail/#fincen"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Fincen leaks are the latest finance corruption megaleak, following Paradise Papers (2017), Panama Papers (2016), Swiss Leaks (2015), Lux Leaks (2014). It's a trove of 2100 "Suspicious Activity Reports" (SARs) from the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
The reporting on the leaks was shared among multiple journalism orgs, including BBC Panorama, Buzzfeed, and more than 100 other orgs in 88 countries, coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, whose master report is a key to the whole leak:
&lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/global-banks-defy-u-s-crackdowns-by-serving-oligarchs-criminals-and-terrorists/"&gt;https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/global-banks-defy-u-s-crackdowns-by-serving-oligarchs-criminals-and-terrorists/&lt;/a&gt;
Here's the nut: the world's largest banks knowingly laundered billions of dollars for the worst criminals, looters and oligarchs in the world. The financial regulators knew they were doing it.
Many had paid billions in fines and avoided criminal prosecutions for earlier misdeeds and continued to facilitate the flows of vast, illicit fortunes on behalf of brutal criminals and dictators, including many who were under sanction.
The US government knew. The banks knew. Neither acted to stop it. The banks made a fortune for their trouble. I mean, we could just end it there, but the details matter.
Start with the largest bank in the US: Jpmorganchase. Jpmorgan knowingly laundered money for looters from Venezuela and Ukraine and helped launder the billions stolen from Malaysia through the 1MDB scam - $1B of that money passed through JPM's fingers, and they knew it was dirty.
They also laundered millions for Paul Manafort - &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; he'd been forced to resign over money-laundering accusations. The volume of criminal money flowing through JPM INCREASED every year, even as it paid fines in 2011, 2013 and 2014 for money laundering.
JPM told the ICIJ that it plays a "leadership role" in "proactive intelligence-led investigations" and developing "innovative techniques to help combat financial crime."
(ok looter)
Other banks engaged in criminal money-laundering: HSBC, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank and Bank of NY Mellon.
The leaks only represent 0.02% of SARS, and document $2 &lt;em&gt;trillion&lt;/em&gt; in dirty transactions between 1999-2017, with $1.3 &lt;em&gt;trillion&lt;/em&gt; at Deutschebank alone.
Treasury stonewalled ICIJ, but announced that it was seeking public comment "on ways to improve the US's anti-money laundering system."
The reporting not only encompasses the leaked SARs: the media orgs on the job analyzed 17,600 other docs: leaks, court files, FOIA docs, and interviews with experts.
Here's what the banks did: "blindly moving cash through accounts for people they can’t identify, failing to report transactions with all the hallmarks of money laundering until years after the fact, doing business with clients enmeshed in frauds and corruption scandals."
This activity took place while banks like HSBC were &lt;em&gt;already on probation&lt;/em&gt; for other money-laundering crimes. HSBC says it is now "a much safer institution."
Much of the $2T flowed through secrecy jurisdictions - not just the BVI, but also the City of London, Wyoming/Nevada/Delaware, Cyprus, HK, the UAE, Switzerland and Russia - places where companies can have anonymous owners and beneficiaries.
ICIJ traces some of this cash to terrorist orgs, sanctioned individuals in Iran and the former USSR, etc.
JPM laundered more than $1b for a mysterious company called ABSI Enterprises, believed to be a front for Russian mafia boss-of-bosses Semion Mogilevich.
&lt;em&gt;More than $1b&lt;/em&gt;!
The Treasury deputizes banks themselves to fight laundering, giving the largest banks responsibility to catch criminals. Instead, these banks used their privileged position to exact fees from crooks in exchange for keeping schtum!
Meanwhile, the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; compliance officers at the big banks are marginalized and underfunded: "overworked, under-resourced staffers, who typically work in back offices far from headquarters and have little clout within their organizations."
"Documents in the FinCEN Files show compliance workers at major banks often resort to basic Google searches to try to learn who’s behind transfers involving hundreds of millions of dollars."
Which means that banks can only figure out if they're laundering money for a monster if that person is already in the news - and usually, that happens &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the money has winged its way to some other far-off destination.
Meanwhile, the money people &lt;em&gt;at the bank&lt;/em&gt; go to great lengths to keep their own compliance people from busting them, like Standard Chartered, where bankers used aliases so payment from sanctioned criminals could go through.
Some of the dodges used to disguise the true owners of money laundries are hilariously amateurish, and the only thing worse is how long they were overlooked by the regulators who were supposed to be preventing them.
For example, the UK's Companies House - the corporate regulator - allowed a couple of anonymous companies in the British Virgin Islands to be listed as the owners of &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of UK companies, all housed in a vacant former nail bar in Wales.
One of these companies, Novirex, funneled gigantic sums via obviously fraudulent payments, such as $400k for "knee boots" from Hong Kong, millions in all, while booking $2500/yr in revues, with the help of Jpmorganchase.
JPM had a financial partnership with the Latvian bank ABLV, a laundry for Russian criminals, whose own compliance department rated *90 percent&amp;amp; of its customers as "high risk." They moved billions, with the help of JPM.
This was on Jamie Dimon's watch, when the division that did these dirty deals ballooned to $4.13b/year. Novirex was the laundry that Paul Manfort used to do his own financial crimes. JPM laundered at least $230m for them.
Then there's HSBC, long one of the world's most unapologetic criminal banks. The leaks reveal HSBC's before/during/after the fact involvement in the World Capital Market Ponzi scheme, which bilked poor people from the world's poorest places out of $80m.
While WCM was under investigation in &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; countries, while HSBC was &lt;em&gt;still on probation&lt;/em&gt; for laundering money for the mass-murdering Mexican narco cartels, it kept WCM's account active and allowed $7m to be emptied out of it.
Just part of $900m in shell-company-linked anonymous transactions HSBC cleared for the world's crime-lords and dictators.
Indeed, all 5 of the worst culprits in the leaks had taken "deferred prosecution deals" - probation for earlier crimes, which they continued to commit.
Like Bank of NY Mellon, which laundered $1.3b for Putin ally and mafioso Oleg Deripaska. Or Deutsche Bank, which moved $11b for Deripaska.
And all five banks laundered money for Ukrainian oligarch/wanted criminal Dmytro Firtash - while telling Treasury that they were cracking down on financial crime. JPM laundered $2b for Firtash.
The leaks reveal what we've known all along: a fine is a price. The banks were fined billions. They made hundreds of billions, and laundered trillions. Fine 'em billions more, and they'll just absorb it as the cost of doing business.
The stiffest penalty ever paid by a bank - $8.9b to France's BNP Paribas, a criminal conviction, 13 staffers forced out - resulted in its share price going UP, because the deal allowed to to resume US dollar trading after one year.
Deutsche Bank paid $258m in fines for violating sanctions, announced it had cleaned house, and (the leaks reveal) &lt;em&gt;one month later&lt;/em&gt; started plans to launder money for Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky - $240m in all.
Deutsche Bank now says it had "past weaknesses," has "learnt from our mistakes" "systematically tackled" the issues and "we're a different bank now."
Who the fuck believes this bullshit?
The US Treasury's financial crimes enforcers, for one.
These companies shouldn't get deferred convictions. The individuals who perpetrated these crimes, and the executives who signed off on them, should face criminal prosecution.
They should forfeit all their assets. The banks should be broken up - and broken up again, and again and again - until they are small enough that no one can claim the organization was too big to effectively police.
This is not the first, or second, or third, or fourth set of finance leaks that reveals that the "finance industry" is a literal, non-metaphorical, non-hyperbolic global crime syndicate.
But it is the first set of leaks that details just how well that fact is understood by government financial regulators, and exactly how unbelievably bad they are at their jobs.
I say "unbelievable" because only an idiot would believe that anyone is this bad at their job. "Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it's enemy action." This isn't incompetence.
It's complicity.

&lt;h1&gt;California's fire-debt (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/21/too-big-to-jail/#aflame"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In MIT Tech Review, James Temple lays out the science behind California's fire-debt, a century of zero-tolerance mismanagement, exacerbated by climate crisis's torrential rains and ferocious heat, which drive massive plant growth and die-off: a tinderbox.
&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/17/1008473/wildfires-california-prescribed-burns-climate-change-forests/"&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/17/1008473/wildfires-california-prescribed-burns-climate-change-forests/&lt;/a&gt;
It's an important addition to Pro Publica's late August story on the wildfires - the fact that they are foreseeable and preventable, and that controlled burns, while expensive, are FAR cheaper than wildfires.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/29/chickenized-home-to-roost/#cal-burning"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/29/chickenized-home-to-roost/#cal-burning&lt;/a&gt;
Early 20th Century megafires kicked off an official policy of ending all forest fires, with the result that 100 years' worth of flammable material has backlogged in the region's forests.
The climate crisis made forests more flammable with extreme growth-and-death cycles driven by rains and heat, waiting to be set off by climate-change-driven lightning storms and PG&amp;amp;E;'s absolute malfeasance in maintaining its infrastructure.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/1306359385656946688"&gt;https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/1306359385656946688&lt;/a&gt;
Five of the ten worst fires in California history are &lt;em&gt;burning right now&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;20 million acres&lt;/em&gt; of California need "fuel reduction" - 2/3 of the state's forests, six times more than has burned this year.
Fuel reduction can be managed burns or thinning with chainsaws.
It's expensive: burning is $200/acre; thinning can be $1K/acre. Clearing 1.1m acres/year (which we'd have to do for a decade to clear the debt) will cost more than $1b/year.
If you think that's expensive, consider the costs of wildfires: $800/acre just to fight them, and the damage can easily run to the billions - the month-long 2017 Wine Country fires cost $9b.
Clearouts are a no-brainer and infinitely cheaper - and safer, and less traumatic - than letting wildfires rage, but California is still heel-dragging, with the landmark $1b allocated over 5 years representing only 20% of what's needed.
The US Forest Service and Gov Newsom have inked a toothless Memoradum of Understanding that will augment this, but it includes &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; funding.
Meanwhile, we must revise our building codes to include more setback from forests, better materials, more evac routes.
And to really make a difference, we have to slow climate change. Of course. These fires will get a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; worse if we don't do that.

&lt;h1&gt;Company that makes millions spying on students will get to sue a whistleblower (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/20/links-arent-performances/#free-ian-linkletter"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Yesterday, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia handed down a jaw-droppingly stupid and terrible decision, rejecting the whistleblower Ian Linkletter's claim that he was engaged in legitimate criticism when he linked to freely available materials from the ed-tech surveillance company Proctorio:
&lt;a href="https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/ca/23/01/2023BCCA0160.htm"&gt;https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/ca/23/01/2023BCCA0160.htm&lt;/a&gt;
It's been a minute since Linkletter's case arose, so I'll give you a little recap here. Proctorio is a massive, wildly profitable ed-tech company that sells a surveillance tool to monitor students while they take high-stakes tests from home. The tool monitors the student's computer and the student's face, especially their eye-movements. It also allows instructors and other personnel to watch the students and even take control of their computer. This is called "remote invigilation."
This is ghastly in just about every way. For starters, Proctorio's facial monitoring software embeds the usual racist problems with machine-learning stuff, and struggles to recognize Black and brown faces. Black children sitting exams under Proctorio's gimlet eye have reported that the only way to satisfy Proctorio's digital phrenology system is to work with multiple high-powered lights shining directly in their faces.
A Proctorio session typically begins with a student being forced to pan a webcam around their test-taking room. During lockdown, this meant that students who shared a room - for example, with a parent who worked night-shifts - would have to invade their family's privacy, and might be disqualified because they couldn't afford a place large enough to have private room in which to take their tests.
Proctorio's tools also punish students for engaging in normal test-taking activity. Do you stare off into space when you're trying through a problem? &lt;em&gt;Bzzzt&lt;/em&gt;. Do you read questions aloud to yourself under your breath when you're trying to understand their meanings? &lt;em&gt;Bzzzt&lt;/em&gt;. Do you have IBS and need to go to the toilet? &lt;em&gt;Bzzzt&lt;/em&gt;. The canon of remote invigilation horror stories is filled with accounts of students being forced to defecate themselves, or vomit down their shirts without turning their heads (because looking away is an automatically flagged offense).
The tragedy is that all of this is in service to the pedagogically bankrupt practice of high-stakes testing. Few pedagogists believe that the kind of exam that Proctorio seeks to recreate in students' homes has real assessment merit. As the old saying goes, "Tests measure your ability to take tests." But Proctorio doesn't even measure your ability to take a test - it measures your ability to take a test with three bright lights shining directly on your face. Or while you are covered in your own feces and vomit. While you stare rigidly at a screen. While your tired mother who just worked 16 hours in a covid ward stands outside the door to your apartment.
The lockdown could have been an opportunity to improve educational assessment. There is a rich panoply of techniques that educators can adopt that deliver a far better picture of students' learning, and work well for remote as well as in-person education. Instead, companies like Proctorio made vast fortunes, most of it from publicly funded institutions, by encouraging a worse-than-useless, discriminatory practice:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/24/proctor-ology/#miseducation"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/24/proctor-ology/#miseducation&lt;/a&gt;
Proctorio clearly knows that its racket is brittle. Like any disaster profiteer, Proctorio will struggle to survive after the crisis passes and we awaken from our collective nightmare and ask ourselves why we were stampeded into using its terrible products. The company went to war against its critics.
In 2020, Proctorio CEO Mike Olsen doxed a child who complained about his company's software in a Reddit forum:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/01/bossware/#moral-exemplar"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/01/bossware/#moral-exemplar&lt;/a&gt;
In 2021, the reviews for Proctorio's Chrome plugin all mysteriously vanished. Needless to say, these reviews - from students forced to use Proctorio's spyware - were &lt;em&gt;brutal&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/04/hypervigilance/#radical-transparency"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/04/hypervigilance/#radical-transparency&lt;/a&gt;
Proctorio claims that it protects "educational integrity," but its actions suggest a company far more concerned about the integrity of its own profits:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/16/unauthorized-paper/#cheating-anticheat"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/16/unauthorized-paper/#cheating-anticheat&lt;/a&gt;
One of the critics that Proctorio attacked is Ian Linkletter. In 2020, Linkletter was a Learning Technology Specialist at UBC's Faculty of Education. His job was to assess and support ed-tech tools, including Proctorio. In the course of that work, Linkletter reviewed Proctorio's training material for educators, which are a bonanza of mask-off materials that are palpably contemptuous of students, who are presumed to be cheaters.
At the time, a debate over remote invigilation tools was raging through Canadian education circles, with students, teachers and parents fiercely arguing the merits and downsides of making surveillance the linchpin of assessment. Linkletter waded into this debate, tweeting a series of sharp criticisms of Proctorio. In these tweets, Linkletter linked to Proctorio's unlisted, but publicly available, Youtube videos.
A note of explanation: Youtube videos can be flagged as "unlisted," which means they don't show up in searches. They can also be flagged as "private," which means you have to be on a list of authorized users to see them. Proctorio made its training videos unlisted, but they weren't private - they were visible to anyone who had a link to them.
Proctorio &lt;em&gt;sued Linkletter&lt;/em&gt; for this. They argued that he had breached a duty of confidentiality, and that linking to these videos was a &lt;em&gt;copyright violation&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/17/proctorio-v-linkletter/#proctorio"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/17/proctorio-v-linkletter/#proctorio&lt;/a&gt;
This is a classic SLAPP - a "strategic litigation against public participation." That's when a deep-pocketed, thin-skinned bully, like Proctorio, uses the threat of a long court battle to force their critics into silence. They know they can't win their case, but that's not the victory they're seeking. They don't want to win the case, they want to win the argument, by silencing a critic who would otherwise be bankrupted by legal fees.
Getting SLAPPed is no fun. I've been there. Just this year, a billionaire financier tried to force me into silence by threatening me with a lawsuit. Thankfully, Ken "Popehat" White was on the case, and he reminded this billionaire's counsel that California has a strong anti-SLAPP law, and if Ken had to defend me in court, he could get a fortune in fees from the bully after he prevailed:
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1531684572479377409"&gt;https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1531684572479377409&lt;/a&gt;
British Columbia also has an anti-SLAPP law, but unlike California's anti-SLAPP, the law is relatively new and untested. Still, Proctorio's suit against Linkletter was such an obvious SLAPP that for many of us, it seemed likely that Linkletter would be able to defend himself from this American bully and its attempt to use Canada's courts to silence a Canadian educator.
For Linkletter to use BC's anti-SLAPP law, he would have to prove that he was weighing in on a matter of public interest, and that Proctorio's copyright and confidentiality claims were nonsense, unlikely to prevail on their merits. If he could do that, he'd be able to get the case thrown out, without having to go through a lengthy, brutally expensive trial.
Incredibly, though, the lower court found against Linkletter. Naturally, Linkletter appealed. His "factotum" is a crystal clear document that sets out the serious errors of law and fact the lower court made:
&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aB1ztWDFr3MU6BsAMt6rWXOiXJ8sT3MY/view"&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aB1ztWDFr3MU6BsAMt6rWXOiXJ8sT3MY/view&lt;/a&gt;
But yesterday, the Court of Appeal &lt;em&gt;upheld&lt;/em&gt; the lower court, repeating all of these gross errors and finding for Proctorio:
&lt;a href="https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/ca/23/01/2023BCCA0160.htm"&gt;https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/ca/23/01/2023BCCA0160.htm&lt;/a&gt;
This judgment is &lt;em&gt;grotesque&lt;/em&gt;. It makes a mockery of BC's anti-SLAPP statute, to say nothing of Canadian copyright and confidentiality law. For starters, it finds that publishing a link can be a "performance" of a copyrighted work, which meant that when Linkletter linked to the world-viewable Youtube files that Proctorio had posted, he infringed on copyright.
This is a perverse, even surreal take on copyright. The court rejects Linkletter's argument that even Youtube's terms of service warned Proctorio that publishing world-viewable material on its site constituted permission for people to link to and watch that material.
But what about "fair dealing" (similar to fair use)? Linkletter argued that linking to a video that shows that Proctorio's assurances to parents and students about its products' benign nature were contradicted by the way it talked to educators was fair dealing. Fair dealing is a broad suite of limitations and exceptions to copyright for the purposes of commentary, criticism, study, satire, etc.
So even if linking is a copyright infringement (ugh, seriously?!), surely it's fair dealing in this case. Proctorio was selling millions of dollars in software to public institutions, inflicting it on kids whose parents weren't getting the whole story. Linkletter used Proctorio's own words to rebut its assurances. What could be more fair dealing than that?
Not so fast, the appeals panel says: they say that Linkletter could have made his case just as well without linking to Proctorio's materials. This is...bad. I mean, it's also &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, but it's very &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, too. It's wrong because an argument about what a company intends &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; has to draw upon the company's &lt;em&gt;own statements&lt;/em&gt;. It's absurd to say that Linkletter's point would have been made equally well if he said "I disbelieve Proctorio's public assurances because I've seen seekrit documents" as it was when he was able to link to those documents so that people could see them for themselves.
But it's &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; because it rips the heart out of the fair dealing exception for criticism. Publishing a link to a copyrighted work is the most minimal way to quote from it in a debate - Linkletter literally didn't reproduce a single word, not a single &lt;em&gt;letter&lt;/em&gt;, from Proctorio's copyrighted works. If the court says, "Sure, you can quote from a work to criticize it, but only so much as you need to make your argument," and then says, "But also, simply referencing a work without quoting it &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; is taking too much," then what reasonable person would &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; try to rely on a fair dealing exemption for criticism?
Then there's the confidentiality claim: in his submissions to the lower court and the appeals court, Linkletter pointed out that the "confidential" materials he'd linked to were available in &lt;em&gt;many places&lt;/em&gt; online, and could be easily located with a Google search. Proctorio had uploaded these "confidential" materials to many sites - without flagging them as "unlisted" or "private."
What's more, the videos that Linkletter linked to were in found a "Help Center" that didn't even have a terms-of-service condition that required confidentiality. How on Earth can materials that are publicly available all over the web be "confidential?"
Here, the court takes yet another bizarre turn in logic. They find that because a member of the public would have to "gather" the videos from "many sources," that the collection of links was confidential, even if none of the links in the collection were confidential. Again, this is both &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.
Every investigator, every journalist, every critic, starts by looking in different places for information that can be combined to paint a coherent picture of what's going on. This is the heart of "open source intelligence," combing different sources for data points that shed light on one another.
The idea that "gathering" public information can breach confidentiality strikes directly at all investigative activity. Every day, every newspaper and news broadcast in Canada engages in this conduct. The appeals court has put them all in jeopardy with this terrible finding.
Finally, there's the question of Proctorio's security. Proctorio argued that by publishing links to its educator materials, Linkletter weakened the security of its products. That is, they claim that if students know how the invigilation tool works, it stops working. This is the very definition of "security through obscurity," and it's a practice that every serious infosec professional rejects. If Proctorio is telling the truth when it says that describing how its products work makes them stop working, then they make bad products that no one should pay money for.
The court absolutely flubs this one, too, accepting the claim of security through obscurity at face value. That's a finding that flies in the face of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; security research.
So what happens now? Well, Linkletter has lost his SLAPP claim, so nominally the case can proceed. Linkletter could appeal his case to Canada's Supreme Court (about 7% of Supreme Court appeals of BC appeals court judgments get heard). Or Proctorio could drop the case. Or it could go to a full trial, where these outlandish ideas about copyright, confidentiality and information security would get a thorough - and blisteringly expensive - examination.
In Linkletter's statement, he remains defiant and unwilling to give in to bullying, but says he'll have to "carefully consider" his next step. That's fair enough: there's a lot on the line here:
&lt;a href="https://linkletter.opened.ca/stand-against-proctorios-slapp-update-30/"&gt;https://linkletter.opened.ca/stand-against-proctorios-slapp-update-30/&lt;/a&gt;
Linkletter answers his supporters' questions about how they can help with some excellent advice: "What I ask is for you to do what you can to protect students. Academic surveillance technology companies would like nothing more but for us all to shut up. Don’t let them silence you. Don’t let anyone or anything take away your human right to freedom of expression."

To kick things off, I'm serializing chapter one, where we meet Marty Hench, a 67-year-old, hard-charging forensic accountant with 40 years' experience busting Silicon Valley's most eye-watering scams, and learn about his last case - recovering a billion dollars' worth of cryptographic secrets.
Here's the previous installments:

And now, here's today's serial installment:
We built the system to be secure. You know me, I’m a paranoid old creep with a dirty mind, so everything I did, I did right. The keys were on an air gap system. I bought that system myself off a pile of boxed HP laptops at Fry’s just a couple of weeks before they closed their doors for good.”
“Rest in peace.”
“It was time. But back when you could go into Fry’s, you could pick up a laptop sealed in shrink-­w rap, carry it yourself to the cashier, pay cash for it, and walk out, stopping only to show your receipt to the poor door-­checker. Then you could take it to the data center, badge into the clean room, lay out your workbench, unscrew that sucker, and remove every single network interface with a pair of pliers, not just snipping the traces but ripping them right off the board.”
“Lucky you didn’t snap the board.”
He grimaced. “I did. I bought three of them so I could take a mulligan or two if I needed it. I only needed one spare, as it turned out. Then it went into a safe, a good safe, rated for three hours. There’s a watchman who makes physical rounds of every safe room, every two hours. And I locked up the BIOS with a hardware token. Steal that laptop, you’d still need my token.”
“And yet . . .”
“You know how they say anyone can design a security system that he himself can’t figure out how to break?”
“Schneier’s law.”
“Schneier’s law. Yeah. Someone smarter than I am figured it out.”
“The watchman?”
“No, though he might have been in on it. They fired him. The safe was opened, the laptop was gone.”
“And the hardware token?”
“You’ll love this.”
“I can’t wait.”
He tugged his forelock and adopted a broad Cockney accent that would have embarrassed Dick van Dyke. “Guv’nah, I was pickpocketed, so I was.”
“I don’t believe it. Pickpocketing is supposed to be a dead art. Who was working the scam, Apollo Robbins?”
He shrugged. “I don’t reckon so. But yeah, there’s plenty of Vegas acts that do pickpocketing stuff, and there’s a pretty big YouTube competitive pickpocket scene with tutorials. Plus, there’s the European talent, a lot of it, never really died out there. Covent Garden is like a plague reservoir for the pathogen, and you get an outbreak every year or two.”
“You had the hardware token on your key ring?”
“That day, I did. I’d been in the data center. Then we went to dinner. Hydra. The prix fixe. The chef’s table is nice, but the taster menu gets you the octopodi. Someone bumped me between the data center and my front door.”
“Oof,” I said. “Did you have to ring the downstairs neighbor’s doorbell and climb out on their balcony?”
“Don’t be stupid,” he said. “In the first place, Sethu has her own keys. In the second place, the outside doors here are locked and armed when we’re AFK.”
I’d noticed the locks on the outside doors, and the break sensors, and the cameras—­both the covert and overt ones. There were probably some I’d missed. I wouldn’t put it past Danny to have a lidar rig in the shrubs, something to help the system distinguish between cat burglars and house cats.
“The watchman from the data center,” I said. “That’s your guy. Probably not the mastermind, but he’ll be the key to it all.”
“Looks like they socially engineered him. Matched him on Tinder, messaged him, &lt;em&gt;Oh, is that where you work? I’m just around the corner—­want to meet me for a quick boba tea?&lt;/em&gt;”
“Catfished. Honey trap.”
He sighed. “Yeah. It was a good one.”
“You reported the theft?”
“The insurance company will pay for a new laptop, which, frankly, I don’t need, because I already have the spare I bought when I was going through the whole rigamarole to set up the air gap. But that’s not the valuable part.”
“No, it isn’t. How about the keys?”
“Yeah, how about them?”
“First, have you warned your source that you lost them, so they can tell Apple and Samsung and all the other manufacturers that rely on those secure enclave chips? And second, have you warned your users that their money isn’t safe?”
He looked over at Sethu, at Palo Alto, at his lemonade glass, and at the clouds in the sky. Long looks. The silence spoke volumes.
“How much money is the Trustlesscoin ledger worth, Danny?”
He looked me dead in the eye now. “About a billion.”
We’d already been talking about trillions, so I shouldn’t have been shocked. But tech founders are always throwing around big numbers, and I’ve developed the mental habit of knocking a few zeroes off any claims about “total addressable markets.”
Trustlesscoin was the new crypto on the block. My unconscious estimate of its value was in the low tens of millions, which is also a big number, but not a billion.
“A billion here, a billion there—­”
He cut me off. “Pretty soon, it starts to add up to real money. Yeah, I know, Marty. Don’t joke, you’re not good at it.”
“When did you lose the keys?”
He checked his watch—­a mechanical one, not ostentatious, an old wartime Rolex, from when men’s Oysters were the size of a nickel, not these giant tourbillon monstrosities that cost a million bucks and looked like a poor man’s idea of a rich man’s watch. “Seventy-­four hours and thirty minutes ago.”
“Give or take.”
“You’re not good at comedy, Marty. We’ve established that.”
“What fallout has there been?”
“Not much,” he said. “In fact, maybe none. We have a pretty good statistical picture of what normal Trustless transaction activity looks like, and nothing has rung the alarm bells yet.”
“Yet. But maybe not ever. Maybe they can’t figure out how to exploit what they got.”
“Or maybe they’re biding their time. Or running an old-school salami-­slice grift, shaving a lot of pennies, getting ready to cash out.”
“Can you block that? They have to convert Trustlesscoins into fiat to get away with it, right?”
“They do, but we can’t stop them. We’re on every major exchange, not just to other tokens but also a bunch of different kinds of fiat and stablecoins. How do you think we got to a billion dollars so quickly? Trustless is both highly liquid and highly efficient. That’s why it’s the future of finance.”
“And money laundering.”
For a second, I thought he was going to throw his lemonade glass, dash it to the cool flagstones of his roof garden. He took a deep breath and then another and then set the glass down. “And money laundering. Marty, stop fucking with me. I am keenly aware that there are money launderers using my service. That has been apparent since the start. Some of these money launderers are very far away and would struggle to reach me if my technology did something to upset them. Some of them are closer.”
He shook his head violently. “Marty, I am shitting bricks here. There’s another shoe getting ready to drop, and when it does, I’m going to go down with it. Hard. I’m not just talking about losing my reputation and my fortune, I’m not just talking about ruining the life of that woman over there who dragged me back from the brink. I’m talking about being targeted for physical violence by unreasonable, sadistic, powerful criminal men who amassed their fortunes by spilling an ocean of blood and who cannot be placated. Nor can they be fended off, not unless I want to live my life inside a bunker.
“I don’t know who stole those keys, Marty. I shouldn’t have had them in the first place. I am now in a position where everything I hold dear is on the line, and so I called you. You and I go way back, you’re my friend and I trust you, but I didn’t call you because I wanted to cry on your shoulder.”
“You called me because you think I can get the keys back.”
“Bullshit. I called you because I’m desperate. I don’t think anyone can get those keys back. I think that inside of a month, everything I care about will be in ruins. Major technology platforms that depend on secure enclaves for things way beyond Trustlesscoin will be exposed because of my recklessness, and they will be fucked. Secure enclaves are designed to be tamper-proof. You try to take one off a board the way I did with those air gap laptops’ network interfaces and you render them permanently inoperable. They can’t be field updated. They have no flashable BIOS. A vulnerability in a secure enclave is permanent.
“But the trillions of dollars in damage that I will do to the largest tech companies in the world will not worry me, because I will either be on the run or dead. Not a good death, either, Marty.
“So I called you because before that happens, I plan on exhausting every avenue of mitigation available to me.”
“If I recover them?”
He snorted. “You do that, you might save my life and rescue a third of the top performers on the S&amp;amp;P 500 from their worst earnings call since the Great Financial Crisis.”

&lt;h1&gt;An end-of-year retrospective (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/25/looking-back/#happy-new-year"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Every day, I revisit all the posts I've ever made, over more than 20 years of blogging; I review posts from one year, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and 20 years ago, revisiting my priors and regrounding myself in the arc of stories I've followed for decades. I call it "The Memex Method":
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/the-memex-method-238c71f2fb46"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/the-memex-method-238c71f2fb46&lt;/a&gt;
As I'm about to leave on vacation for two weeks, I won't be blogging until after Jan 7. Normally, I'd just skip over those days for my "This Day in History" posts, but I made the mistake of looking ahead at those holiday-season posts from years gone by and I realized I wanted to handle them, copy-pasting their URLs and publishing them, just to reinfuse them into the supersaturated solution of half-remembered facts that my mind periodically crystallizes into stories, novels, speeches, essays, and nonfiction books.
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/divination-7cfec2b1a6b8"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/divination-7cfec2b1a6b8&lt;/a&gt;
So I've produced a mega-retrospective, consisting of all the links for #20yrsago, #15yrsago, #10yrsago, #5yrsago, and #1yrago, for every day between now and January 7. See you in 2023!

&lt;h1&gt;The CARES Shock Doctrine (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/14/shock-doctrine/#shock-doctrine"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
It's been 13 years since Naomi Klein's Shock Doctrine described the neoliberal playbook: crises are seized as a moment to smuggle in policies that could not pass public muster under normal circumstances, ratcheting private gains at public expense.
&lt;a href="https://tsd.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine.html"&gt;https://tsd.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine.html&lt;/a&gt;
In March, Congress pass the CARES Act, sweeping law that nominally offered relief to Americans. It was the opening salvo in a fusillade of interventions whose workings are poorly understood - which have served to make the already wealthy immeasurably wealthier.
If you've wondered how the stock and bond markets could be soaring even as unemployment has also climbed to apocalyptic levels, as an eviction crisis looms, as Americans form mile-long lines for food banks -- this is how.
If you're only going to read one longread this week, read Robert Brenner's "Escalating Plunder," in the New Left Review. It's long, but not as long as the legislation it analyzes, and it is much, much clearer about what that legislation accomplishes.
&lt;a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/II123/articles/robert-brenner-escalating-plunder"&gt;https://newleftreview.org/issues/II123/articles/robert-brenner-escalating-plunder&lt;/a&gt;
Start with the full scope of the bailout: the $454b that Congress gave to America's largest corporations is table-stakes. Congress also created a bull market in corporate debt by guaranteeing to buy bonds issued by the companies if no one else wanted them.
Even junk bonds issued by companies whose mismanagement and corporate autophagia - buybacks, executive compensation, layoffs - had driven them to death's door &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the crisis.
That guarantee allowed corporate America a tenfold leverage of its "relief" through debt, yielding ~$4.54 &lt;em&gt;trillion&lt;/em&gt;. The public's relief budget - unemployment, cash, and student loans weighed in at a mere $603B.
Put that another way: the USG just handed the largest companies in the US 200% of their total annual profits in "relief," with no strings attached, save for some minor constraints on the aviation industry.
And while the bills that created this corporate welfare program originated with Senate Republicans, that's only because Congressional Dems explicitly asked them to do so, abdicated Congress's power of the purse to let the GOP decide who would get money, and how much.
It's hard not to interpret this as Dems handing the donor class a cash bribe on the eve of an election. It's not just letting the Senate write the bills - it's passing them by "voice vote," which lets Dem Congressjerks vote in favor without having their support recorded.
It's an unbelievably idiotic piece of tactics, a bet that corporations will reward Dem complicity with GOP looting by helping Dems, instead of the GOP. The bet that plutes will hate racism more than they love money is painfully stupid.
Contrast that with what Dems COULD have spent on: health care, more unemployment/paycheck protection, food and rent money. The could have &lt;em&gt;dared&lt;/em&gt; the GOP to deny Americans the basics of human survival - again, on the eve of an historic election.
Instead, they sat idly by as the Fed's bond guarantee ensured a supply of easy money for corporations whose ability to borrow had vanished prior to the crisis as investors had finally wised up to the foolishness of loaning to firms dedicated to devouring themselves.
That ready access to credit then boosted the stock market: the bull market for bonds begat a bull market in stocks. If you want to know how America's billionaires made more billions during the crisis, that's how.
It's not merely investor confidence in e-commerce that made Bezos his excess billions: its Amazon's ability to borrow &lt;em&gt;$10 billion at 0.4 percent on a three year bond.&lt;/em&gt;
The corporate wing of the Dems is pretty open about all this. Look at Richard Neal, who trumpeted that he wasn't voting for "stimulus" (which would help all of us), but rather "relief" - for the investors and execs he'd just bailed out.
Neal was an architect of the post-2008 bailouts too, playing a key role in the decision not to help everyday Americans - who had been preyed upon by unimaginably wealthy financiers - with their mortgages, but rather, to make the finance sector whole.
(Neal is at the center of another scandal: Leaked internal comms from the Mass College Dems reveal that they conspired to smear Neal's primary opponent, Alex Morse, with false sexual abuse allegations)
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/08/11/college-democrats-alex-morse-richard-neal/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2020/08/11/college-democrats-alex-morse-richard-neal/&lt;/a&gt;
Congressional Dems have, once again, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. The CARES Act they let the GOP write and then rammed through into law includes $174b worth of new tax breaks for the super-rich that were jettisoned from Trump's 2019 tax bill as too extreme.
We are living through a shock doctrine. This could be the moment in which America recognizes the brittleness of its public sphere and corporate arrangements and restructures them to survive the wave of climate emergencies on our horizon.
Instead, both parties have conspired to double down on that brittleness, that fragility, that precarity, with hardly a peep in objection from lawmakers in either house.
The major exception, naturally, is AOC, who called it "One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history [with] crumbs for our families."

&lt;h1&gt;NYC homeless lose bathroom access (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/14/shock-doctrine/#everybody-poops"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The homelessness epidemic in America predates the covid pandemic, but the latter is about to make the former much worse - and as horrifying and dehumanizing as homelessness was in The Before, it's a million times worse today.
Start with the obvious. Everybody poops. Despite San Francisco's decades of insisting that the public human defecation problem was the result of humans, and not the absence of toilets, the solution to pooping is toilets. There is no other solution.
New York City is notoriously short of public toilets, even for employed, homed people - it's the land of the "Bathrooms are for customers only" sign.
At Patrick Nielsen Hayden once told me, whatever demerits the explosion of Manhattan Starbuckses meant for the city, at the very least, it solved NYC's urgent "Nowhere to go" crisis.
But not anymore.
New York's restaurants and cafes no longer allow homeless people to use their facilities. Even Penn Station has excluded homeless people from its bathrooms.
&lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/8/13/21365521/nyc-homeless-bathroom-penn-station-subways-manhattan"&gt;https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/8/13/21365521/nyc-homeless-bathroom-penn-station-subways-manhattan&lt;/a&gt;
With the loss of access to toilets comes a loss of access to water, too: the 3600 New Yorkers who live on the streets and in subways no longer have reliable access to drinking water, and are suffering severe dehydration.
Writing in The City, Reuven Blau interviews Jared Mitchell, a 24 year old homeless man who had the humiliating experience of "going on himself" when he couldn't locate a toilet. Richard Parry, a 51 year old homeless man, tells Blau, "You probably smell me now."
Mayor de Blasio put 12 toilets out for public use early in the crisis, but withdrew them after the were vandalized. They were not replaced.
Meanwhile, the tourists and office workers homeless people depend on when panhandling are gone, leaving homeless people with no money for food: Charmain Hamid, a 45 year old homeless person, is wasting away.
Ashley Belcher, a 27 year old homeless woman with ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome asked to use the bathroom at the Lenox Health Greenwich Village medical facility, but was denied entry because she doesn't have a mental disorder.
As soup kitchens move to outdoor service, homeless people can no longer use their toilets, either.
It's not clear what will solve this, apart from the proven Housing First approach of providing homes to homeless people.
&lt;a href="https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/"&gt;https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/&lt;/a&gt;
When a standalone "Portland Loo" can cost $200k to install merely to provide ONE toilet, it's easy to see how providing homes isn't just humane - it's cost effective, too.

&lt;h1&gt;NYC Street View, WPA edition (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/14/shock-doctrine/#wpa-nyc"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
During the New Deal, the WPA and the NYC Tax Department sent photographers to every municipal building in the five boroughs, producing a geotagged archive of the city's streetscenes from 1939-41.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/nynyma_rec0040_1_00201_0002.jpg"/&gt;
These images were placed in an interactive map system by Julian Boilen, called "Street View of 1940s New York," which lets you click around a map of the city to navigate these photos geographically.
&lt;a href="https://1940s.nyc/map#13.69/40.7093/-73.99397"&gt;https://1940s.nyc/map#13.69/40.7093/-73.99397&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/nynyma_rec0040_1_00554_0001.jpg"/&gt;
It's a legit masterpiece, and endlessly fascinating, a veritable time-machine.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/nynyma_rec0040_3_00423_0021.jpg"/&gt;
One note: Boilen says that the use of the images is limited to NYC's terms and conditions, but these were federally commissioned works and are presumptively in the public domain.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/nynyma_rec0040_1_01265_0071.jpg"/&gt;
The NYC guidelines basically say, "Don't violate copyright." These are neither copyrighted nor copyrightable. As far as I can tell: you're good.

&lt;h1&gt;Maidan in Belarus (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/14/shock-doctrine/#walkaway"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Alexander Lukashenko is president of Belarus: they call him "the last Soviet dictator." He is responsible for  decades of brutal human rights abuses and comic mismanagement, and he led a coronavirus response that was so inept, it even made the US look good by comparison.
Lukashenko's not even good at being a dictator. His master plan to maintain the pretense of free and fair elections this year involved purging the establishment candidates running against him, "businessmen" running on a ticket of "efficiency."
He also purged a popular anti-corruption Youtuber.
This left only one opposition candidate  at the fore: Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, running as a proxy for her imprisoned husband Sergey Tikhanovsky.
&lt;a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/08/belarus-lukashenko-protests-election-results/"&gt;https://jacobinmag.com/2020/08/belarus-lukashenko-protests-election-results/&lt;/a&gt;
Tikhanovskaya was a powerful rival to Lukashenko, who has used populism to style himself a champion of ordinary Belarusians - the sort who might have looked skeptically upon business leaders promising to replace him.
But Tikhanovskaya *actually&amp;amp; champions causes important to everyday Belarusians, winning support from the country's workers, as well as political freedoms like a release of political prisoners and free and fair elections.
Her platform was so obviously, visibly popular that it led many to predict an imminent change in power in Belarus, a new Maidan moment. So when Lukashenko stole the election, claiming a brazen 80% majority, the people rose up.
For days, larger and larger crowds have taken to the streets, demanding political change, braving vicious police violence that only seemed to inspire larger turnouts. Lukashenko's claims that the protests are driven by outsiders have not convinced anyone.
The perseverance of the protesters is a moral lesson to everyone else in the country - including, incredibly, some of the police who had been beating and gassing them. Even though 6700 people have been arrested and tortured, the protesters keep facing down police lines.
Military officers, appalled by the crackdown, are posting social media videos in which they destroy their uniforms. Police officers are giving media interviews in which they proclaim their unwillingness to follow "illegal orders."
The interior minister went on TV to formally apologize to the protesters for their treatment.
And 50 riot cops dropped their shields and embraced the protesters, switching sides.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/europe/belarus-protests-riot-police-intl/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/europe/belarus-protests-riot-police-intl/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
Solidarity is a powerful force. Everyday people always have more in common with each other than we do with our leaders. Getting your soldiers to shoot the other soldiers is one of the hardest problems in any military.
Many people know the story of the Christmas Truce of 1914, when German and British soldiers emerged from their trenches to fraternize in no man's land, singing carols, playing football and exchanging gifts.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce&lt;/a&gt;
Less well known is the utter horror this provoked in their command structures, the generals who took every step possible to avert such an occurrence again.
Something like the scene in Belarus was on my mind when I wrote the climax of my 2017 novel Walkaway (I won't give away any more spoilers). For me, the ultimate lesson here is that the two sides are "bosses vs everyone else" - not "everyone vs the bosses' shock troops."
So much of the status quo depends on people who should be on the same side fighting one another on behalf of  minorities of powerful people, who, while formally opposed to one another, are only contesting who should be dictator, not whether dictators should be abolished.

&lt;h1&gt;Fraud-resistant election-tech (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/12/tear-down-that-wall/#bmds"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Despite the (ill-informed) assurances of people who should know better, there is no way to run a secret, anonymous, secure ballot over the internet. It's a science fantasy, like faster-than-light drives or time machines. It's a thought experiment, not a plan.
Elections are actually easy: paper ballots, hand-marked and hand counted in sight of scrutineers from opposing parties. But thanks to a highly consolidated vote-tech sector with plenty of money to spend, Americans have been convinced that this can't work for America.
It's a bizarre and innumerate proposition: America has more people, so it will have more ballots, so it can't count them by hand.
Uh, folks?
Canada and the UK don't consolidate all their ballots to a single counting-house where, like, eight people tally the nation's votes.
The votes are counted at the polling place. America has more polling places than Canada, but there's no reason it can't have the same ratio of polling places - and ballot counters - to voters as Canada does. To a first approximation, that's already true.
The American concern for electoral fraud is forever in tension with the American exceptionalist insistence on using dumpster-fire vote-tech sold by litigious grifters who sue the critics who blow the whistle on their awful security.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/11/seeing-things/#ess"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/11/seeing-things/#ess&lt;/a&gt;
Thus it is that, year after year, security researchers - like the merry crew at Defcon's annual Voting Village - publish reports of jaw-dropping incompetence in vote-tech systems, each revealing how little progress has been made since the last.
&lt;a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/voting-village-report-defcon27.pdf"&gt;https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/voting-village-report-defcon27.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
To the extent that anyone serious about this stuff believes in electoral automation, the one technology they're willing to admit might someday be made secure is the "ballot marking device," a machine that fills in your ballot in a way that facilitates automatic counting.
But BMDs are still hugely controversial: even if you solve the problem of making sure that the machine-readable part and the human-readable part say the same thing (a Very Big Problem), there's a stubbornly intractable problem lurking right behind it: human factors.
In real-world situations and under laboratory conditions, people just don't carefully check their ballots, and the best interventions we have to encourage ballot-checking don't perform very well.
&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152705"&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152705&lt;/a&gt;
Now, an innovative BMD design from Professor Juan Gilbert of the University of Florida demonstrates a very clever technique and promising approach for increasing the likelihood that a voter will notice if their ballot is mis-marked.
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_G8bdlXBAc"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_G8bdlXBAc&lt;/a&gt;
The Transparent Voting Machine is a clear plastic box that shows you your ballot immediately after it's marked, and requires you to touch the spot directly over the place where your selection appears. Intuitively, this sounds like it should work, and experimentally, it does.
In his seminar presentation to Princeton's Center for Information Technology Policy, Gilbert discusses his user studies, where he was able to substantially increase the likelihood that voters would both detect and report irregularities in their ballots.
&lt;a href="https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/CITP+SeminarA+Juan+Gilbert+%E2%80%93+Can+Voters+Detect+Ballot+Manipulations+with+a+Transparent+Voting+MachineF/1_67s0hsf9"&gt;https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/CITP+SeminarA+Juan+Gilbert+%E2%80%93+Can+Voters+Detect+Ballot+Manipulations+with+a+Transparent+Voting+MachineF/1_67s0hsf9&lt;/a&gt;
In his writeup of the seminar, Princeton's Andrew Appel does the math on these studies and concludes that with Gilbert's technology, ballot mismarking would be detected if it occurred above the 0.5% mark: a major improvement over existing designs.
&lt;a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2021/04/12/juan-gilberts-transparent-bmd/"&gt;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2021/04/12/juan-gilberts-transparent-bmd/&lt;/a&gt;
But Appel also follows up with some important caveats: about the physical security of a BMD, the sociology of pollworkers, and what a secretary of state should do if the winning margin is within 0.5%.
BMDs aren't useless. They can be a boon to accessibility, transcending barriers of disability and language fluency. But they're incredibly hard to get right, and the industry that produces, sells and services them is characterized by incompetence and bullying.
America loves vote-tech, but vote-tech is pretty iffy on American democracy. Gilbert's design is incredibly clever and vastly superior to the existing technologies, and if it were adopted, it would be preferable to everything in use today.
That is an admittedly low bar. And meanwhile, people all over the world continue to mark their paper ballots with golf pencils and put them in boxes so that the nice poll-workers can count them by hand later that day.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/30269644288_c1a10197be_k.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Big Tech's secret weapon is switching costs, not network effects (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/12/tear-down-that-wall/#zucks-iron-curtain"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Today in Wired UK, my op-ed: "Why it’s easier to move country than switch social media" - an argument that the real power of social media comes from switching costs, not network effects.
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/social-media-competitive-compatibility"&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/social-media-competitive-compatibility&lt;/a&gt;
Debates over market concentration in social media lean heavily on "network effects," the idea that social media services increase in value as their user-base grows, because the more users they have, the more likely it is that the people you want to talk to have accounts.
But I argue that this misunderstands the technical underpinnings of networked computers - specifically, the role that interoperability plays.
The problem with a focus on network effects is its fatalism: once a system is large enough, it attracts users, and the more users it has, the more users it attracts.
A critique that focuses on network effects concludes the race is for permanent, winner-take-all dominance.
But once you throw interoperability into the mix, the race changes. An interoperable social media ecosystem doesn't just neutralize network effects, it reverses them.
If someone offers a Facebook competitor that lets you talk to Facebook users, that also doesn't spy on you, then Facebook isn't a walled garden anymore, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet for competitors who can offer better-than-FB to every FB user.
We can get that interop in lots of ways. A social media platform might offer it on its own (as Twitter has promised to, with Project Blue Sky); or a government might mandate interop (as is under discussion in the UK, US, and EU).
But there's a third way: Competitive Compatibility, AKA Adversarial Interoperability: that's when new services plug into the existing ones without their permission or even against their wishes, using bots, scraping, reverse-engineering, etc.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability&lt;/a&gt;
There's a comcom story in the history of every tech giant - it's how Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc attained scale in markets dominated by incumbent large firms - and the only reason comcom has fallen by the wayside is that the big tech firms have kicked the ladder away.
When you add comcom to the interoperability mix, the whole equilibrium shifts. History shows us that when governments order companies to open their systems, they can subvert these orders, redesigning them so the mandated interfaces cease to connect to the parts that matter.
Companies do this because government mandates are slow and complex and can be undermined with bad-faith arguments and stalling tactics. But with comcom in the mix, there is an immediate and (from the cheater's perspective) undesirable response to shenanigans.
With comcom in the mix, any new service whose service is nerfed by a tech giant that screws with its mandatory interfaces can immediately switch to bots, scraping and reverse-engineering - replacing the managed interface with a chaotic guerrilla war.
This is the kind of fight that users hate, and will blame the big companies for, as they are challenged to prove they aren't bots, have their usage mistaken for scraping, and lose contact with their off-service friends.
With comcom, shenanigans drives users off the service, rather than locking them in.
If your analysis of Big Tech starts and ends with network effects, the game is already lost. All we can do is hope that decades of antitrust litigation will result in breakups...eventually.
My grandmother fled the USSR after WWII, and lost contact with her entire family. She didn't even know if her parents and brother in Leningrad had survived for years. She abandoned everything she owned and nearly everyone she loved, forever.
Her family stayed behind because of switching costs - not just the logistical difficulties of obtaining permission to leave and sponsorship abroad, but the cost of leaving behind everything and everyone.
The architects of the Berlin Wall claimed that it wasn't keeping East Germans &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;, they claimed it was keeping bad guys &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of the DDR.
Today, Zuck claims we can't interoperate with Facebook is to keep privacy-violators and other rule-breakers &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; - not to keep his users &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;.
Meanwhile, I've emigrated from Toronto to San Francisco to London to Los Angeles. I kept my stuff. I kept my family. I can move back if I change my mind. Low switching-costs enabled those moves.
Thinking about Big Tech in terms of network effects leads to despair. Thinking about interop and switching costs shows the way out.
Mr Zuckerberg, tear down that wall.

&lt;h1&gt;Podcasting How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/12/tear-down-that-wall/#htdsc-2"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
This week on my podcast, the second part of a five (?) part serialized reading of my 2020 One Zero book HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM, a book arguing that monopoly – not AI-based brainwashing – is the real way that tech controls our behavior.

There's a certain kind of Internet Person who makes the world a better place every day, just by showing up. People like Ryan North, whose many accomplishments include his daily, long-running, brilliant Dinosaur Comics:
&lt;a href="https://www.qwantz.com/"&gt;https://www.qwantz.com/&lt;/a&gt;
The secret to Dinosaur Comics is the simplicity of the bit, coupled with the lengths that North takes it to: it's the same six stock-art panels of a T-Rex, a Utahraptor and a Dromiceiomimus, discoursing on some funny, bizarre or philosophical topic. Three times per week, every week since 2003, Ryan North has written new dialog for these three dinosaurs, as T-Rex crushes a log cabin (panel 3) and a tiny person (panel 4), while pondering the imponderable.
Thinking up three different gags per week for the same six panels for nearly 20 years has meant that North has had to go to some very weird and amazing places, really push through all the obvious riffs, and take us beyond the obvious bounds of the imagination.
Now, Dinosaur Comics is all the more amazing in that it is basically a side-hustle and passion project. North has several &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; careers he pursues, like producing improbable, delightful, wildly popular crowdfunded books. His choose-your-own adventure version of Hamlet was the most successful publishing Kickstarter when it funded:

And then there was "Machine of Death," a pair of CC-licensed theme anthologies and a card game North co-created, about a world in which people know the exact time and manner of their deaths.
&lt;a href="http://machineofdeath.net/"&gt;http://machineofdeath.net/&lt;/a&gt;
Not only are these great books, they also destroyed Glenn Beck's 2010 book launch by beating it to the top of the charts, causing Beck to conceive of a bizarre, long-running feud against the "culture of death."
&lt;a href="http://blog.serindu.com/2010/10/28/glenn-beck-thinks-i-celebrate-destruction/"&gt;http://blog.serindu.com/2010/10/28/glenn-beck-thinks-i-celebrate-destruction/&lt;/a&gt;
North's wide-ranging interests and deeply nerdy outlook (he's also an accomplished computer scientist) make him perfectly suited to writing superhero comics, and his runs on several Marvel titles are distinguished for their humor and inventiveness:
&lt;a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Ryan_North/Writer"&gt;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Ryan_North/Writer&lt;/a&gt;
But beyond the comics, the webcomics, the science fiction and the Shakespeare-inspired remix comedies, North is also an accomplished science communicator. His first book-length foray into the field was 2018's "How to Invent Everything," which addressed itself to time-travelers stranded in the past and explained how to bootstrap a technologically advanced civilization as a frame for stripping away the layers of knowledge and art underpinning our everyday lives:
&lt;a href="https://www.howtoinventeverything.com/"&gt;https://www.howtoinventeverything.com/&lt;/a&gt;
Now, North has published a sequel of sorts: How to Take Over The World, a popular science book that tours a wide-ranging set of technological ideas by means of explaining how to realize the supervillain plots so beloved of Marvel comics:
&lt;a href="https://supervillainbook.com/"&gt;https://supervillainbook.com/&lt;/a&gt;
HTTOTW is full of extremely funny, extremely informative riffs that make for an engrossing frame for very deep dives into knowledge that are esoteric, interdisciplinary, and damned interesting. For example, if you want to build a supervillain lair, you want to be beyond the reach of state authority, and that's a jumping-off point to recount the history of nation-states, the deeply flawed nature of seasteading and other "libertarian exit" projects, and, finally, a triumphant exploration of Antarctic treaty law and Buckminster Fuller's plan for vast, floating spheres, with a detour into carbon nanotubes and other exotic new materials.
HTTOTW gives the same treatment to immortality, bringing back dinosaurs (so you can terrorize your enemies from atop a ferocious thunder-lizard), controlling the world's weather, traveling through time, switching off the internet, and sending information forward in time to the heat-death of the universe.
For each of these, North presents the hilarious and often terrible histories of previous attempts, the current state of the art, and the outer speculative edge of science. Each one is a way to talk about biology, physics, sociology, and politics - and each one sneakily introduces the book's main theme, which is that the supervillain's true, inevitable downfall is their belief in their singular genius and desire to ignore or trample the agency of others.
That message emerges inexorably through North's expert scientific explanations and often laugh-out-loud humor: supervillains are, basically, toddlers who would like very much for everyone to simply let them decide how everything should work, without complaining about their own wants and needs.
At a moment when selfish assholes have decided that the pandemic is over, and other people have no right to demand that they consider how their actions harm others, HTTOTW is a timely reminder that we all have intertwined destinies, and that science and reality have an anti-hyper-individualist bias:

&lt;img alt="The 1969 Nieman-Marcus Christmas Catalog listing for the Honeywell Kitchen Computer. The ad copy reads, 'If she can only cook as well as Honeywell can compute.

&lt;h1&gt;Your mom is a tech ninja (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/19/the-weakest-link/#moms-are-ninjas"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
What makes someone "good at technology?" In part, it's an understanding of the underlying technical principles and industry conventions - what a "power on" icon looks like, say. I have a lot of that. But there's another component, one that's often invisible to people like me: the extent to which your technology was designed to suit your needs.
I have a lot of that, too. I'm a 50 year old, middle-class, tech-industry adjacent professional man with an honorary PhD in computer science. Not only do tech designers think like and about me when they create new products - they often &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; me what I think I need.
Several times per year, I'll get on a call with product managers and researchers at both big and small tech companies to discuss some planned product. I am good at tech, but tech is also good at me. It doesn't just meet me halfway - it bends over backwards to meet my needs.
Some years ago, I joined the advisory board for Simply Secure, a nonprofit that helps tech designers build strong security tools that are intended to be usable by non-technical people.
&lt;a href="https://simplysecure.org/"&gt;https://simplysecure.org/&lt;/a&gt;
In my first call with the org's founder, Meredith Whittaker, I suggested a slogan for the products we helped with: "So easy, even your boss can use them." You see, I've been an IT manager, and in that role, I've had to institute security policies, like minimum standards for passwords, mandatory VPN usage, and other important (but often cumbersome) measures.
In these circumstances, I always did my best to explain to my co-workers that these measures were not me being high-handed or sadistic, loading them up with pointless busywork. I tried really hard - with pretty good success - to convey the rationale behind these measures and the risk I was trying to mitigate.
This isn't just a matter of being respectful to the people I was working to protect, it was also key to that protection - when people don't accept security measures, they circumvent them. As this amazing ethnography of security-bypassing medical professionals puts it, "You Want My Password or a Dead Patient?"
&lt;a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws/pubs/ksbk15-draft.pdf"&gt;https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws/pubs/ksbk15-draft.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
It's really important to get rank-and-file workers to understand why you're asking them to endure the inconvenience of a security measure, but it's far more important to get your &lt;em&gt;boss&lt;/em&gt; to understand this. After all, even if your co-workers don't buy in, you have some authority to mandate their cooperation, whereas your boss gets to override you.
Everyone who's worked in security has had experience with this: you get a call from the CEO like, "Look, Poindexter, I don't give a monkey's asshole about the VPN or whatever. I need to download a presentation to raise the capital to pay your salary, and as soon as the kid in the lobby of this Comfort Inn is done Reddit shitposting on the shared lobby iMac, I need to download that file to this USB stick I found in the parking lot of an Arby's and transfer it to my laptop. Make it happen!"
This is why I suggested "So easy your boss can use it," as a replacement for the odious "So easy your mom can use it." Bosses have the social clout to force the universe to rearrange itself to your comfort.
Moms, not so much.
Tech designers are notoriously indifferent to the needs of moms - and other marginalized users - when they plan their products. The emblem of this was the Honeywell Kitchen Computer, a $10,600 recipe-organzing database system the size of a kitchen counter, offered for sale in the 1969 Nieman-Marcus Christmas catalog:
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/11/kitchen-computer/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2012/11/kitchen-computer/&lt;/a&gt;
The men who designed this computer didn't ask their wives - whose nightly dinner-cooking duties they set out to automate - whether they needed a $10,000, 100lb recipe organizer that you queried by punched paper tape. Not one unit sold.
Everything your mom does with a computer is twice as hard as the things that I do with a computer. Even if your mom gets more consideration from product designers today than she did in 1969, I'm getting more consideration. When I use a computer, I'm playing the game of life on the lowest difficulty setting:
&lt;a href="https://whatever.scalzi.com/2022/05/18/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-ten-years-on/"&gt;https://whatever.scalzi.com/2022/05/18/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-ten-years-on/&lt;/a&gt;
But as easy as things are for me, they're even easier for your boss, who doesn't just play on the lowest setting - your boss gets to play in God Mode. They get highest-level access to company systems &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they get to ignore the security policies their underlings must obey.
Hence IFL Science's study of CEO passwords for Nordpass, which found that the median CEO uses a password that is "startlingly dumb," in the phraseology of the headline for &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;'s article on the study, by Katie Wickens:
&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-passwords-most-used-by-ceos-are-startlingly-dumb/"&gt;https://www.pcgamer.com/the-passwords-most-used-by-ceos-are-startlingly-dumb/&lt;/a&gt;
The study analyzed 290 million data-breaches and clustered the leaked passwords by job title, finding that the most popular passwords for the highest-ranking employees were typical of the worst password choices: "123456," "picture1," "password," and names like "Tiffany," as well as mythological animals like "Dragon."
These passwords aren't &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; than the median breached password, but they should be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. With great power comes great responsibility, after all. C-Suite Impersonations are extremely dangerous to companies - forged emails from top execs have led to millions of losses at a swoop, when the impersonator orders an underling to transfer millions to pay a bogus invoice.
&lt;a href="https://www.batesgroup.com/publications/joic-02-2017-0001.pdf"&gt;https://www.batesgroup.com/publications/joic-02-2017-0001.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
It's a safe bet that the IT managers who work for these execs know about the risk of C-Suite account takeovers, and it's a sure bet that the execs who chose these bad passwords had heard advice about choosing strong passwords. But unlike your mom, your boss gets to overrule IT policies.
Passwords suck and they're hard to do well. You (and your mom, and your boss) should be using a password manager and using a different, strong, randomly generated password for every service.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/dice"&gt;https://www.eff.org/dice&lt;/a&gt;
You should also turn on two-factor authentication for every service, using either a hardware token or a standalone 2FA app (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; SMS!):
&lt;a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication"&gt;https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication&lt;/a&gt;
Meanwhile, let's normalize saying, "So easy my boss can use it" and banish "so easy my mom can use it" to the scrapheap of history.
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;a name="they-screw-you-at-the-pharmacy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="A US $100 bill. Benjamin Franklin's portrait has been replaced with a Symbicort inhaler. The seal of the US Treasury has been replaced with the logo for Wellcare." src="https://craphound.com/images/inhaler-pbm.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The impossible scam of US drug plans (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/19/the-weakest-link/#they-screw-you-at-the-pharmacy"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
US health insurance is a dismal swamp of scams and opacity, a system whose patient outcomes are in freefall and whose patient costs are screaming upwards on a line that is asymptotic to infinity. As bad as the whole health insurance system is, drug plans are &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;.
It is literally impossible to get a good deal on drug plans. Literally. How can I be sure that this is the case? Because Wendell Potter can't, and if he can't, you can't. Potter is the former top Cigna lobbyist who changed sides and became a tireless advocate for Medicare for All, dedicating himself to revealing the evil schemes behind your spiraling costs and declining health.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/12/boeing-crashes/#wendellpotter"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/12/boeing-crashes/#wendellpotter&lt;/a&gt;
Potter was one of the architects of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA), providing talking points to the Congressmonsters who voted for it. Under MMA, Medicare was prohibited from negotiating drug prices with pharma companies. Thus Americans pay US companies 200-400% more for their meds than Canadians pay to those same US companies:
&lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-282"&gt;https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-282&lt;/a&gt;
Potter is now &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; Medicare, and so he's got a front-row seat to the MMA's effects, two decades on. He's got an Rx for a Symbicort inhaler for a chronic cough, and he pays $606 every three months for this. That's because Medicare Part D users are expected to have a drug plan, and these drug plans are all eye-glazingly complex scams:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/04/house-always-wins/#are-you-on-drugs"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/04/house-always-wins/#are-you-on-drugs&lt;/a&gt;
Now, Potter is an industry insider, so he knows that there are often generic alternatives to name-brands like Symbicort. He asked his doc, and she prescribed a generic, fluticasone propionate-salmeterol. That's where Potter's tale gets interesting (and for interesting, read "terrible"):
&lt;a href="https://wendellpotter.substack.com/p/i-just-caused-a-long-line-at-the"&gt;https://wendellpotter.substack.com/p/i-just-caused-a-long-line-at-the&lt;/a&gt;
It turns out that, thanks to MMA, Medicare often provides &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; coverage for generics, as a condition of secret rebate deals drug plan insurers cut with "Pharmacy Benefit Managers" (PBMs). PBMs are also a scam, one of those boring, complex, useless elements of US health insurance that exists solely to produce billions for monopolists:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/11/number-eight/#erisa"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/11/number-eight/#erisa&lt;/a&gt;
PBMs get special dispensation to create monopolies, in the name of cutting deals that are supposed to benefit the patients who rely on them. This special dispensation was originally coupled with a legal obligation to wield monopoly buying power on behalf of patients, but the PBMs successfully lobbied to do away with that obligation. They get the privilege, but no responsibilities to go with it.
Potter's drug plan comes from Wellcare. Sure enough, they provide zero coverage for the generic alternative to Symbicort. But Potter is a pro. He knows that services like GoodRx let you comparison shop and search for discounts to get a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; deal on insurance-excluded generics than you'd get by going through your insurer.
GoodRx sent Potter to his local Rite-Aid, where a three month supply of fluticasone propionate-salmeterol costs $286.50. Now, fluticasone propionate-salmeterol isn't actually a generic for Symbicort - it's a generic for a &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; med, from Mylan, called Wixela.
So Potter, being a pro, asked the Rite-Aid pharmacist if Wixela was covered by his drug plan, and it was - $141 for a three month supply, a $55.17/month savings over the generic.
So Potter sort-of got a happy ending. All he had to do to save $155/month was:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know that generics exist;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask his doctor for a generic;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be told that a generic didn't exist for his med;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press on and get a scrip for a generic of a similar med;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a search-engine to find a deal on his generic because his insurance doesn't cover it;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask the pharmacist whether the name-brand alternative to the generic &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; covered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple!
Of course, by this point, Potter had &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; been paying the higher price for some time, shoveling money into monopolists' gaping maws. There is arguably no one better equipped in America to do what Potter did, and even he lost hundreds of dollars before he managed it.
As Potter says, people with "cancer, MS, or other life-threatening conditions," often must spend thousands before their insurance even kicks in, and even then, their insurers likely don't cover many of their meds. That's why so many people &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; insurance end up in medical bankruptcy.
By design, the MMA made Medicare Part D drug coverage impossible to decipher, "because of the ever-changing list of medications insurance plans will or will not cover," and remember, it also &lt;em&gt;banned Medicare from bargaining on drug prices&lt;/em&gt;.
Potter closes with a note of hope: there's an activist group called "Lower Out of Pockets NOW" that is attracting bipartisan Congressional support, with talk of forming a caucus to address pharma ripoffs:
&lt;a href="https://www.loopcoalition.co/"&gt;https://www.loopcoalition.co/&lt;/a&gt;
In the meantime, there's the all-American tactic of "have you tried not being sick?" coupled with "do a search on GoodRx" and "remember to ask your pharmacist about generics &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; name-brands."

&lt;img alt="KC Green's infamous This Is Fine dog meme; the word FINE has been replaced with the Equifax logo, so it reads This Is Equifax, and the background has been replaced with a nuclear mushroom cloud." src="https://craphound.com/images/thisisexperian.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Experian doxes the world (again) (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/30/dox-the-world/#experian"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The nonconsensually compiled dossiers of personal information that Experian assembled on the entire population of the USA may currently be exposed via dozens, perhaps hundreds, of sites, thanks to a grossly negligent security defect in Experian's API.
The breach was detected by Bill Demirkapi, a security researcher and RIT sophomore, and reported on by Brian Krebs, the excellent independent security reporter.
&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experian-api-exposed-credit-scores-of-most-americans/"&gt;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experian-api-exposed-credit-scores-of-most-americans/&lt;/a&gt;
Experian, like Equifax, has unilaterally arrogated to itself the right to collect, store and disseminate our personal information, and, like Equifax, it faces little regulation, including obligations not to harm us or penalties when it does.
Experian's API allows criminals to retrieve your credit info by supplying your name and address, information that is typically easy to find, especially in the wake of multiple other breaches, such as Doordash's 5m-person 2019 breach and Drizzly's 2.5m-person 2020 breach.
Demirkapi explains that the API is implemented by many, many sites across the internet, and while Experian assured Krebs that this bug only affected a single site, it did not explain how it came to that conclusion.
Demirkapi discovered the defect while he was searching for a student loan vendor. There is a way to defend yourself against this attack: freeze your credit report. Credit freezes were made free (but opt-in only) in 2018, after the Equifax breach.
&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/credit-freezes-are-free-let-the-ice-age-begin/"&gt;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/credit-freezes-are-free-let-the-ice-age-begin/&lt;/a&gt;
Indeed, you may have already been thinking about the Equifax breach as you read this. In many ways, that breach was a wasted opportunity to seriously re-examine the indefensible practices of the credit-reporting industry, which had not been seriously scrutinized since 1976.
1976 was the year that Congress amended the Equal Credit Opportunity Act after hearing testimony about the abuses of the Retail Credit Company - a company that swiftly changed its name to "Equifax" to distance itself from the damning facts those hearings brought to light.
Retail Credit/Equifax invented credit reporting when it was founded in Atlanta in 1899. For more than half a century, it served as a free market Stasi to whom neighbors could quietly report each other for violating social norms.
Retail Credit's permanent, secret files recorded who was suspected of being gay, a "race-mixer" or a political dissident so that banks and insurance companies could discriminate against them.
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/09/equifax-retail-credit-company-discrimination-loans"&gt;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/09/equifax-retail-credit-company-discrimination-loans&lt;/a&gt;
This practice was only curbed when a coalition of white, straight conservative men discovered that they'd been misidentified as queers and commies and demanded action, whereupon Congress gave Americans limited rights to see and contest their secret files.
But these controls were never more than symbolic. Congress couldn't truly blunt the power of these private-sector spooks, because the US government depends on them to determine eligibility for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
It's a public-private partnership from hell. Credit reporting bureaux collect data the government is not legally allowed to collect on its own, then sells that data to the government (Equifax makes $200m/year doing this).
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004200823/http://www.cetusnews.com/business/Equifax-Work-for-Government-Shows-Company%E2%80%99s-Broad-Reach.HkexS6JAq-.html"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171004200823/http://www.cetusnews.com/business/Equifax-Work-for-Government-Shows-Company%E2%80%99s-Broad-Reach.HkexS6JAq-.html&lt;/a&gt;
These millions are recycled into lobbying efforts to ensure that the credit reporting bureaux can continue to spy on us, smear us, and recklessly endanger us by failing to safeguard the files they assemble on us.
This is bad for America, but it's great for the credit reporting industry. The Big Three bureaux (Equifax, Experian and Transunion) have been on a decade-long buying spree, gobbling up hundreds of smaller companies.
These acquisitions lead directly to breaches: a Big Three company that buys a startup inherits its baling-wire-and-spit IT system, built in haste while the company pursued growth and acquisition.
These IT systems have to be tied into the giant acquiring company's own databases, adding to the dozens of other systems that have been cobbled together from previous acquisitions.
This became painfully apparent after the Equifax breach, so much so that even GOP Congressional Committee chairs called the breach "entirely preventable" and the result of "aggressive growth." But they refused to put any curbs on future acquisitions.
&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/420582-house-panel-issues-scathing-report-on-entirely-preventable-equifax-data"&gt;https://thehill.com/policy/technology/420582-house-panel-issues-scathing-report-on-entirely-preventable-equifax-data&lt;/a&gt;
A lot has happened since Equifax, so you may have forgotten just how fucked up that situation was. Equifax's IT was so chaotic that they couldn't even encrypt the data they'd installed. Two months later, they "weren't sure" if it had been encrypted.
&lt;a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/450429891/Following-Equifax-breach-CEO-doesnt-know-if-data-is-encrypted"&gt;https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/450429891/Following-Equifax-breach-CEO-doesnt-know-if-data-is-encrypted&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Six months&lt;/em&gt; before the breach, outside experts began warning Equifax that they were exposing our data:
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ne3bv7/equifax-breach-social-security-numbers-researcher-warning"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/ne3bv7/equifax-breach-social-security-numbers-researcher-warning&lt;/a&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; action Equifax execs took? They sold off a shit-ton of stock:
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/sec-says-former-equifax-executive-engaged-in-insider-trading"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/sec-says-former-equifax-executive-engaged-in-insider-trading&lt;/a&gt;
The Equifax breach exposed the arrogance and impunity of the Big Three. Afterward, Equifax offered "free" credit monitoring to the people they'd harmed. One catch: it was free for a year; after that, they'd automatically bill you, annually, forever.
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911025943/https://therealnews.com/t2/story:19960:Equifax-Data-Breach-is-a-10-out-of-10-Scandal"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20170911025943/https://therealnews.com/t2/story:19960:Equifax-Data-Breach-is-a-10-out-of-10-Scandal&lt;/a&gt;
And you'd pay in another way if you signed up for that "free" service: the fine print took away your right to sue Equifax, forever, no matter how they harmed you:
&lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/equifax-lobbied-kill-rule-protecting-victims-data-breaches-2587929"&gt;https://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/equifax-lobbied-kill-rule-protecting-victims-data-breaches-2587929&lt;/a&gt;
The credit bureaux bill themselves as arbiters of the public's ability to take responsibility for their choices, but after the breach, the CEO blamed the entire affair on a single "forgetful" flunky:
&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-03-former-equifax-ceo-blames-breach-on-one-it-employee.html"&gt;https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-03-former-equifax-ceo-blames-breach-on-one-it-employee.html&lt;/a&gt;
Then he stepped down and pocketed a $90m salary that his board voted in favor of:
&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2017/09/26/equifax-ceo-richard-smith-net-worth/"&gt;https://fortune.com/2017/09/26/equifax-ceo-richard-smith-net-worth/&lt;/a&gt;
Of course they did! His actions made the company so big that even after the breach, the IRS  picked it to run its anti-fraud. Equifax got $7.5m from Uncle Sucker, and would have kept it except that its anti-fraud site was &lt;em&gt;serving malware&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/equifax-irs-data-breach-malware-discovered/"&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/equifax-irs-data-breach-malware-discovered/&lt;/a&gt;
Equifax eventually settled all the claims against it for $700m in 2019:
&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/19/equifax-agrees-to-pay-700m-after-massive-data-breach/"&gt;https://nypost.com/2019/07/19/equifax-agrees-to-pay-700m-after-massive-data-breach/&lt;/a&gt;
But it continued to average five errors per credit report:
&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/11/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-takes-aim-equifax-credit-scoring/"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/11/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-takes-aim-equifax-credit-scoring/&lt;/a&gt;
And it continued to store sensitive user-data in an unencrypted database whose login and password were "admin" and "admin":
&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equifax-password-username-admin-lawsuit-201118316.html"&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equifax-password-username-admin-lawsuit-201118316.html&lt;/a&gt;
Congress introduced multiple bills to force Equifax, Experian and Transunion to clean up their act.
None of those bills passed.
&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/after-equifaxs-mega-breach-nothing-changed-1536241622-baf8e0cf-d727-43db-b4d4-77c7599fff1e.html"&gt;https://www.axios.com/after-equifaxs-mega-breach-nothing-changed-1536241622-baf8e0cf-d727-43db-b4d4-77c7599fff1e.html&lt;/a&gt;
The IRS shrugged its shoulders at America, telling the victims of Equifax's breach that their information had probably already leaked before Equifax doxed them, so no biggie:
&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/355862-irs-significant-number-of-equifax-victims-already-had-info-accessed-by"&gt;https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/355862-irs-significant-number-of-equifax-victims-already-had-info-accessed-by&lt;/a&gt;
Since then there have been other mass breaches, most recently the Facebook breach that exposed 500m people's sensitive data. That data can be merged with data from other breaches and even from "anonymized" data-sets that were deliberately released:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/21/re-identification/#pseudonymity"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/21/re-identification/#pseudonymity&lt;/a&gt;
And while you can theoretically prevent your data from being stolen using the current Experian vulnerability by freezing your account, that's not as secure as it sounds.
Back in 2017, Brian Krebs reported that Experian's services were so insecure that anyone could retreive the PIN to unlock a frozen credit report by ticking a box on a website:
&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/experian-site-can-give-anyone-your-credit-freeze-pin/"&gt;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/experian-site-can-give-anyone-your-credit-freeze-pin/&lt;/a&gt;
That was just table-stakes - it turned out that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the credit bureaux had an arrangement with AT&amp;amp;T's telecoms credit agency that was so insecure that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; could unlock your locked credit report:
&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/another-credit-freeze-target-nctue-com/"&gt;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/another-credit-freeze-target-nctue-com/&lt;/a&gt;
These companies came into existence to spy on Americans in order to facilitate mass-scale, racist, ideological and sexual discrimination. They gather data of enormous import and sensitivity - data no one should be gathering, much less retaining and sharing.
They handle this data in cavalier ways, secure in the knowledge that their integration with the US government wins them powerful stakeholders who will ensure that the penalties for the harm they inflict add up to less than profits those harms generate for their shareholders.
This is why America needs a federal privacy law with a "private right of action" - the ability to sue companies that harm you, rather than hoping that federal prosecutors or regulators will decide to enforce the law.

Experian promises that this breach only affects one company that mis-implemented its API. We would be suckers to take it at its word. It didn't know about this breach until a college sophomore sent in a bug report - how would it know if there were others?

&lt;h1&gt;Audio from last night's Canada Reads event in Kelowna (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/07/bookselling-is-back/#kelowna"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Last night I sat down for an interview and lively Q&amp;amp;A at the Kelowna Public Library with the CBC's Sarah Penton as part of the Canada Reads national book prize, for which my book Radicalized is a finalist. Courtney Dickson was kind enough to send me raw audio from the board and  to give me permission to post it. It was a genuinely wonderful night, with great and thoughtful questions, and I’m really glad that I get to share it with you!

The gig economy workers who deliver your @amazon packages are not entitled to sick pay if they think they have covid-19 and want to stay home, rather than delivering contaminated boxes to you.

It's not just Amazon Flex drivers who are being tacitly incentivized by rapacious, giant corporations to show up for work sick. Your Lyft and Instacart drivers are all being given a stark choice: work sick or go broke.
As Sarah Emerson speculates in her One Zero piece, this depraved indifference is likely an epiphenomenon of gig economy companies' urge to preserve the fiction that their workers are contractors, not employees. Contractors don't get sick leave, after all.
“[Amazon is ] basically threatening that I’ll be out of work if I have any  symptoms of being sick, coronavirus or not, but no protections and no  offers for help in the event it happens" - Jeff Perry, Amazon Flex/Uber driver, Sacramento
Lyft's advice to drivers: "disinfect your car" and avoid passengers who appear sick.
As outrage over this policy went viral, Uber reversed its earlier stance and announced that it would offer up to 14 days of "compensation" for some drivers.

&lt;h1&gt;Compromise threatens Intel's chip-within-a-chip (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/07/bookselling-is-back/#csme"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
A new showstopper Intel bug compromises the Converged Security and Management Engine, the computer-within-a-computer that Intel uses for a variety of purposes, some beneficial (detecting malware), some terrible (shutting out free software).
&lt;a href="https://blog.ptsecurity.com/2020/03/intelx86-root-of-trust-loss-of-trust.html"&gt;https://blog.ptsecurity.com/2020/03/intelx86-root-of-trust-loss-of-trust.html&lt;/a&gt;
The Management Engine has long been controversial. It's designed to reach into your RAM and tinker with it in a way that, by design, the CPU can't detect or prevent. This is deliberate: it lets the management engine monitor and disrupt malware.
&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/06/15/intel-x86-processors-ship-with.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2016/06/15/intel-x86-processors-ship-with.html&lt;/a&gt;
But of course, if your Management Engine itself is compromised, then - by design - the part of the computer that you control can neither monitor it, nor prevent it from doing malicious work. In 2017, a ghastly ME bug showed how risky this was.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it&lt;/a&gt;
It's especially bad because ME security is, in part, security through obscurity: Intel barely documents ME function and doesn't permit outside auditing. To make everything worse, there's no way to fully disable it. So ME bugs keep on surfacing, each worse than the last. Here's 2018's:
&lt;a href="https://press.f-secure.com/2018/01/12/intel-amt-security-issue-lets-attackers-bypass-login-credentials-in-corporate-laptops/"&gt;https://press.f-secure.com/2018/01/12/intel-amt-security-issue-lets-attackers-bypass-login-credentials-in-corporate-laptops/&lt;/a&gt;
Which brings me to the new vuln: PT Security shows an early stage attack on the boot ROM, that allows for recovery of a master key that is used to generate all the other keys in the system. It's a deep bug that could potentially compromise all the downstream operations. It's only a partial attack (so far). The key needs to be decrypted to be usable, but the researchers say it's only a matter of time - and they point out that the key is shared across years' worth of Intel processors.
This compromise (when it comes) has profound implications for DRM, which is intrinsically brittle in that it's "break once, break everywhere." Once content is extracted from a DRM wrapper on a compromised system, it can be shared and played back on intact ones. DRM system designers try to address this with tactics like "renewability" and "selectable output control" that allows DRM systems to detect which systems they're running on and refuse to operate if they believe they might be compromised.
This is a thermonuclear option that could make DRM unviable forever. It means that if you had the misfortune to buy an Intel system during the five years that they were manufactured with this defect, you could lose the ability to play content you've already paid for.
Not because you hacked your system, but because you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;. DRM is and always has been a timebomb, ticking down to the moment that execs in a distant boardroom decide to nerf or brick your property. The temptation to downgrade your customers' property to up your profits is irresistible.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers&lt;/a&gt;
But customers don't like getting punished for "doing the right thing." If media companies cancel playback for purchased content on affected Intel systems, they won't be targeting pirates (who get their media DRM-free), but people who deliberately chose to pay.
"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, we don't get fooled again." -GWB
Punishing legit customers to get at pirates is a surefire way to make more pirates.
"Might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb."

&lt;h1&gt;The savior of Waterstones will turn every B&amp;amp;N into an indie (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/07/bookselling-is-back/#dauntbn"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
A great hero of British bookselling is James Daunt, the founder of Daunt Books, whose flagship store is literally the most beautiful bookstore I've ever been to.
&lt;a href="https://dauntbooks.co.uk/shops/marylebone/"&gt;https://dauntbooks.co.uk/shops/marylebone/&lt;/a&gt;
Daunt took over Waterstones in 2011 and rescued it. The chain now runs as a string of indies, with no co-op promotion - instead, the booksellers in each shop choose which books they promote based on local taste. Corporate HQ chooses a book of the month and a book every year for chainwide promotion, but they do so on the basis of their enjoyment of the book - not because a publisher pays them for promo.
The new Waterstones stores are spectacular. There were always some great ones (the Waterstones in Bradford rivals the main Daunt books for beauty), but the vibe and experience of shopping at a post-Daunt Waterstones is a million times better than before. And new shops like the one in Tottenham Court Road really embody what a bookstore can be. The event I did there in 2017 with Laurie Penny was one of the best I've ever done in the UK.
&lt;a href="https://www.waterstones.com/events/cory-doctorow-in-conversation-with-laurie-penny/london-tottenham-court-road"&gt;https://www.waterstones.com/events/cory-doctorow-in-conversation-with-laurie-penny/london-tottenham-court-road&lt;/a&gt;
The good news is that Daunt is now running Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, which has been struggling and worse - pulling desperate moves like laying off all their most experienced booksellers to lower payroll costs, which is obviously a catastrophic mistake. And Daunt's public plan for BN - America's last major chain bookstore - is to replicate what he did with Waterstones. Let the stores run like indies, with local control by experienced booksellers who know and care about their customers' tastes.
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-04/barnes-noble-wants-to-be-more-like-an-indie-bookseller"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-04/barnes-noble-wants-to-be-more-like-an-indie-bookseller&lt;/a&gt;
He's ending co-op promotion, featuring books that the booksellers choose, not books that publishers pay to promote. He's reversing the focus on non-bookstore SKUs (sunglasses, puzzles and scented candles) in favor of, you know...books. They're shrinking CDs and DVDs and expanding kids' books, laying the ground for a new generation of readers, and they're cleaning up, repainting, and generally repairing years of neglect that have given some of the stores the vibe of an abandoned K-Mart.
They're also opening new stores, targeting places that don't have any bookstores (as opposed to places where indie stores have kept the faith and continued to serve their communities). He's shooting for 1,500 stores nationwide. It's superb news for a nation where bookselling has been imperilled for decades. On every tour stop, I always insist that my media escort take me to every B&amp;amp;N in town to sign stock and meet the booksellers. As a recovering bookseller myself, it's one of the great pleasures of the tours. Bookstores are community hubs, and were key to my own literary upbringing. This is just delightful news.

Currently writing: I'm rewriting a short story, "The Canadian Miracle," for MIT Tech Review. It's a story set in the world of my next novel, "The Lost Cause," a post-GND novel about truth and reconciliation. I'm also working on "Baby Twitter," a piece of design fiction also set in The Lost Cause's prehistory, for a British think-tank. I'm getting geared up to start work on the novel afterwards.
Currently reading: Just started Lauren Beukes's forthcoming Afterland: it's Y the Last Man plus plus, and two chapters in, it's amazeballs. Last month, I finished Andrea Bernstein's "American Oligarchs"; it's a magnificent history of the Kushner and Trump families, showing how they cheated, stole and lied their way into power. I'm getting really into Anna Weiner's memoir about tech, "Uncanny Valley." I just loaded Matt Stoller's "Goliath" onto my underwater MP3 player and I'm listening to it as I swim laps.

&lt;h1&gt;Canada's got the world's worst internet ideas (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/11/the-canada-variant/#no-canada"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Canada's government is poised to pass a "harmful content" regulation. It's a worst-in-class mutation of a dangerous idea that's swept the globe, in which governments demand that hamfisted tech giants remove broad categories of speech - too swiftly for meaningful analysis.
Many countries have proposed or passed rules on these lines: Australia, France, UK, Germany, India. They are all bad, but Canada's is literally the worst - as if Trudeau's Liberals sought out the most dangerous elements of each rule and combined them.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daphnehk/status/1421120217585831938"&gt;https://twitter.com/daphnehk/status/1421120217585831938&lt;/a&gt;
What's in Canada's rule? EFF's Corynne McSherry and Katitza Rodriguez break it down.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/o-no-canada-fast-moving-proposal-creates-filtering-blocking-and-reporting-rules-1"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/o-no-canada-fast-moving-proposal-creates-filtering-blocking-and-reporting-rules-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A requirement to remove "lawful-but-awful" speech that is allowed under Canadian law, but effectively also now banned under Canadian law;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;24-hour deadlines for removal, guaranteeing that platforms will not have time to conduct a thorough analysis of speech before it is censored;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A de-facto requirement for platforms to install algorithmic filters to (mis)identify and remove prohibited expression;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge penalties for failing to remove banned speech - and no penalties for erroneously taking down permitted speech - which guarantees that platforms will shoot first and probably not bother to ask questions later;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandatory reporting of &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; harmful content (and the users who post it) to law enforcement and national security agencies;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chinese-style national firewall that will block websites that refuse to comply;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far-reaching data-retention policies that only the largest companies will be able to afford, which will create immortal, leaky repositories of kompromat on every Canadian internet user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse: the specific contours of all these rules will be determined anew with each new Parliament, who will get to appoint a new Canadian "internet czar" with the power to expand and extend the regulation's most dangerous elements.
The proposal allows Canadian cops to confiscate online services' computers if they are suspected of noncompliance - but offers them an insurance policy to avoid having their doors kicked in and their equipment seized: to adopt "advice" from the internet czar.
So not only will the internet czar - who might someday be appointed by PM Maxime Bernier or Doug Ford - get to rewrite the rules in public, they'll also be empowered to go beyond those rules in private "advice" to online services, backstopped by the threat of raids.
The Trudeau government are spinning this hard, just as they did with Bill C-10 (which included deceptive language that, on superficial examination, seemed to limit the scope of the law, but which was superceded by later clauses).
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/01/you-are-here/#crtc"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/01/you-are-here/#crtc&lt;/a&gt;
In this case, the proposal limits regulation to "public" forums. But because the this is copied from other countries, we know there's room to declare a private chat-group public as soon as it hits a certain (unilaterally determined) size threshold:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/faq-why-brazils-plan-mandate-traceability-private-messaging-apps-will-break-users"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/faq-why-brazils-plan-mandate-traceability-private-messaging-apps-will-break-users&lt;/a&gt;
The combination of:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prohibiting broad, poorly defined speech categories;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;harsh penalties for underblocking; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;requiring swift compliance without time for adequate assessment or counternotifications;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all guarantee that tech giants will block all kinds of speech.
But not all speech is equally at risk. People who are already marginalised are disproportionately likely to be censored under rules like this. That's what happened with the US's SESTA-FOSTA rule, nominally intended to prevent sexual trafficking.
In reality, the primary targets of this law became lawful, consensual sex workers, who are exposed to far more risk now that they can no longer operate forums where they trade "bad date" lists and other safety information.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/how-congress-censored-internet"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/how-congress-censored-internet&lt;/a&gt;
This discrimination is sticky, because SESTA caused the shuttering of forums where sex workers advocated for their rights. The more marginalised the speaker, the worst it is - which is why the most heavily impacted group is trans women of colour.

As ever, Michael Geist is the absolute best authority to refer to on this. Geist has documented the "beware of the leopard"-style secrecy of the Liberals, who have taken great pains to shield this policy-making from public scrutiny.

But despite all the tactical obscurity, there IS a way that Canadians can weigh in on this, through this online consultation form. All Canadians should submit comments on this.
&lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/harmful-online-content.html"&gt;https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/harmful-online-content.html&lt;/a&gt;
Online harms rules are a human rights disaster. They've been roundly criticised by UN Rapporteurs and civil society groups all over the world.

France's version - which was not as extreme as Canada's - was struck down as unconstitutional.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/victory-french-high-court-rules-most-hate-speech-bill-would-undermine-free-expression"&gt;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/victory-french-high-court-rules-most-hate-speech-bill-would-undermine-free-expression&lt;/a&gt;
None of this is to say the tech giants are good for speech. They're terrible at moderation - of course they are. The problem with Facebook isn't merely that Zuck is a shitty online emperor for three billion people - it's that no one should have the job of "online emperor."
But the Canadian proposal will ensure that these tech giants are the last generation of online platforms, by imposing a duty to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on speech filters - something that only the largest American companies can afford.
This forecloses on the goal of whittling tech giants to size through interoperability, ending the possibility that co-operatives, nonprofits and startups could independently manage their own spaces that were still connected to the platforms.
&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/07/cory-doctorow-tech-monopolies-and-the-insufficient-necessity-of-interoperability/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2021/07/cory-doctorow-tech-monopolies-and-the-insufficient-necessity-of-interoperability/&lt;/a&gt;
Canada is not alone in planning to convert the tech giants into constitutional monarchs, offering them perpetual dominance in exchange for suffering themselves to be regulated in how they rule our digital lives.
But that's a terrible vision for our online future. We don't want wise emperors running our digital world - we want to &lt;em&gt;abolish&lt;/em&gt; emperors and give people the right to technological self-determination.

&lt;img alt="A chart from Propublica showing the share of 'pass-through' tax breaks that went to the top 1% of Americans by income." src="https://craphound.com/images/pp_passthrough.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;IRS leaks reveal billions reaped through ultra-wealthy lobbying on the tax bill (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/11/the-canada-variant/#shitty-man-of-history-theory"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The latest in Propublica's Secret IRS Files reporting is a crossover episode, combining leaked tax-returns of America's ultrawealthy with campaign contribution data to reveal the incredible return on investment the rich reaped from Trump's Tax Scam.
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-irs-files-reveal-how-much-the-ultrawealthy-gained-by-shaping-trumps-big-beautiful-tax-cut"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-irs-files-reveal-how-much-the-ultrawealthy-gained-by-shaping-trumps-big-beautiful-tax-cut&lt;/a&gt;
You may remember how Trump's "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (AKA the "big, beautiful tax-cut") was a shambles of amendments and annotations, whose final draft was literally covered in hand-scribbled changes that handed millions to donors.
&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/02/handwriting-wall-and-page-senate-passes-tax-bill/915957001/"&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/02/handwriting-wall-and-page-senate-passes-tax-bill/915957001/&lt;/a&gt;
The new Propublica report quantifies the effect of those last-minute changes, and also reveals their causes - the handful of one-percenters who bankrolled senators like Senator Ron Johnson with $20m in campaign funds and reaped $215m back in just the first year of the tax cuts.
Johnson stunned fellow Republican senators by announcing that he would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; support the tax bill, then pressed them to add the provision that allowed three people - owners of Uline and roofing magnate Diane Hendricks - to pocket $215m in one year, with more every year since.
Uline's Dick and Liz Uihlein and Hendricks stand to make more than $500m from Johnson's amendment, which created deductions for "pass-through entities." Johnson claims he did this to "simplify and rationalize the tax code" and help a wide range of business owners.
But Johnson's pass-through rule overwhelming benefits a tiny number of people, most of them major donors to his campaign. These are donors who met with Johnson extensively in the runup to the introduction of his bill.
All told, the major beneficiaries of Trump's tax bill were just 82 households, who pocketed $1 billion in benefits. Many of the beneficiaries are the children or grandchildren of successful businesspeople, who owe their wealth to an accident of birth.
The US system doesn't just allocate billions to people on the basis of which orifice they emerge from - it provides a vast range of bespoke services to allow orifice-tycoons to maintain their fortunes, including accounting magic and lobbying might.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/19/dynastic-wealth/#caste"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/19/dynastic-wealth/#caste&lt;/a&gt;
Take the mysterious, anonymous addition of eight words to the final draft of the tax bill: "applied without regard to the words 'engineering, architecture.'"
No one knows who inserted this text, but it produced $111m in additional wealth for orifice tycoons Brendan, Darren and Katherine Bechtel, the great-grandchildren of the founder of Bechtel. Their father, cousins and other relations also benefited.
While no one knows for sure who added these 8 words, a Bechtel lobbyist called Marc Gerson claimed credit for it. The Bechtel lobbying effort cost $1m. The return on that investment, again, was more than $111m. Why make &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; when you can make &lt;em&gt;laws&lt;/em&gt;?
Bechtel is a curious enterprise: for generations, it firehosed cash on anti-tax extremist politicians and thinktanks - yet the entire Bechtel fortune comes from government contracts.
Today, CEO Brendan Bechtel leads the corporate charge against Biden's infrastructure plan.
The Propublica investigation matched other major donors to specific tax-breaks. Donald Bren, who owns the massive Southern California Irvine Corporation, pocketed $22m after hiring Ernst &amp;amp; Young lobbyist Wes Coulam to go to bat for him.
Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) tycoon Steven Roth spent $5m lobbying for a 20% deduction on REIT dividends. The change lets him deduct $5m/year on the dividends from his company, Vornado Realty Trust.
The heirs of Enterprise Product Partners, a Houston-based pipeline company, pocketed $150m from a pipeline-specific amendment introduced at the last moment by Senator John Cornyn.
They're the 11th richest family in America - and their family pumped a fortune into Cornyn's campaigns through industry association cutouts.
Everyone who voted for the tax bill knew that it was a conspiracy to benefit a tiny number of people at the expense of the vast majority. Treasury economists say that 60% of the tax bill's benefit went to the 1%, and the majority of that went to the 0.1%.
I am not a believer in the Great Man Theory of History. Our world changes because of broad-based political will and grassroots organizing.
But stories like this are enough to make me believe in the Shitty Man Theory of History.
That's the theory that while improving the world is a cooperative, mass effort, destroying it is easy for a handful of immoral sociopaths - ultrawealthy looters, orifice tycoons, and enablers in the House and Senate.
In America's state religion, "business acumen" and "political effectiveness" are code for the dead-eyed, pathological absence of empathy and conscience, and the cynicism to turn those deficits into billions.

&lt;h1&gt;Parts Found in Sea (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/31/parts-found-in-sea/#"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
When I was a young teen, I was obsessed with the Toronto music scene, which is hilarious, because I was too young to get into any of the clubs where it was taking place, like the legendary Larry's Hideaway (believe me, I tried).
But I would obsessively note the names of the bands whose handbills were wheatpasted up and down Yonge Street and scour the bins at Sam the Record Man for their self-produced EPs and then play them over and over.
Some of those bands were...not good.
But I was absolutely obsessed with one band: Parts Found in Sea, whose name was taken from a newspaper headline about a plane crash (!). They were a damned hardworking act, playing - it seemed - every weekend at Larry's.
Since the Napster era, I have been periodically scouring the web for MP3s of the band, for sale, for free, whatever. I just wanted to hear them again.
Sometimes you revisit the music of your youth and realize that what made it good was that your own lack of sophistication - you didn't have the context to make the comparisons with other bands, didn't know that you were hearing a weak imitation of something amazing.
I feared that must be the case with PFIS: the fact that none of their music was available might mean that it just wasn't very good, and hadn't stood the test of time.
Then I discovered Stevy Zong's Youtube video of a live PFIS show at Larry's Hideaway and hearing that music again only renewed my ardor for the band. I also learned the name for their genre: "Darkwave."
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNW89ZLKwSw"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNW89ZLKwSw&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://pluralistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/animation-15.gif"&gt;
(It was also great to see them perform live, at last! The band was dissolved and Larry's was out of buiness by the time I was old enough to get into the club)
Inspired by that video, I bought a "Seat of the Writing Man," one of my favorite EPs by the band, on Ebay, and asked my friendly neighborhood archivist, Taylor Jessen, if he'd rip the vinyl for me, and he very kindly did, sending me the tracks last night.
And the band is every bit as good as I remember. I mean, just fucking great. Especially the Frank Lippai's bass-playing, which is just...wow. As far as I can tell, Lippai is living in London, Ont now, running something called "Artisans Almighty," but that's all I've got.
Frontman Steve Cowal graduated to a semi-famous Canadian band, Swamp Baby, and was featured in Bruce McDonald's "Hardcore Logo," but I can't find anything he's doing these days.
&lt;a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0116488/?ref_=m_nmfmd_msdp_1"&gt;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0116488/?ref_=m_nmfmd_msdp_1&lt;/a&gt;
The EP really showcases some spectacular talent, right down to the engineering by Ken Friesen, who is still working:
&lt;a href="https://www.kenfriesen.com/"&gt;https://www.kenfriesen.com/&lt;/a&gt;
And while some of Cowal's lyrics are a little over-the-top emo, the songs are beautifully constructed, these long, jam-band-ish tracks that have two or three movements apiece, transitioning through different moods. They must have been amazing to dance to at a club.
I just couldn't keep this disc to myself. I've uploaded it for your listening pleasure, but only for 24 HOURS. Tomorrow morning (Pacific), I'll be deleting it. I figure that strikes a balance between celebration and misappropriation.
&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/pfi-s-sot-wm-lp-obverse"&gt;https://archive.org/details/pfi-s-sot-wm-lp-obverse&lt;/a&gt;
But if anyone out there is looking to reissue some wonderful audio unobtanium, they should track down the band and get these tracks into the stream of commerce.

Last night, the Science Fiction Writers of America held its first-ever virtual Nebula Awards, handing out prizes for excellence in the field that had been voted on by its members - the writers' own peers.
&lt;a href="https://nebulas.sfwa.org/award-year/2019/"&gt;https://nebulas.sfwa.org/award-year/2019/&lt;/a&gt;
As ever, the list is a brilliant tour through the year's work, and I'm especially pleased by the best novel winner, Sarah Pinsker, who won for "A Song for a New Day," which I reviewed and blurbed.
&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/09/23/hoodies-considered-harmful.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2019/09/23/hoodies-considered-harmful.html&lt;/a&gt;
"Song" has a bit of (un?)fortunate timing, in that it is about gig economy workers in an oligarchic, locked-down world where pandemic and terrorist have everyone in the country locked inside, permanently, dependent on an Amazon-like company for drone deliveries.
It's a great rock-n-roll novel, about the underground club scene that flourishes in this all-too-familiar totalitarian world - and how it is co-opted by entertainment corporations - and how it ultimately resists co-option and fights a war of liberation.
Congrats to all the winners and nominees!

&lt;h1&gt;Why Minneapolis can't fire violent cops (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/31/parts-found-in-sea/#acab-spring"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
If you're following the wave of uprisings against racist police violence, you've probably heard that Derek Chauvin, the cop who murdered George Floyd, had a long history of criminal conduct, but was still carrying a gun, wearing a badge, and billing the taxpayer.
Chauvin was no aberration. Minneapolis, like many cities, has a police crime problem - that is, a problem addressing the crimes committed by its own police force, thanks to a combination of impunity, white supremacy, opacity, and militarization.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/29/mind-control-skepticism/#qualified-immunity"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/29/mind-control-skepticism/#qualified-immunity&lt;/a&gt;
Even where police reforms are enacted, the forces ignore them...and get away with it. That happened in Minneapolis. As The Marshall Project documents, a half-decade after the DoJ investigated problems with Minneapolis's police, virtually nothing has changed.
&lt;a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/28/before-george-floyd-s-death-minneapolis-police-failed-to-adopt-reforms-remove-bad-officers"&gt;https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/28/before-george-floyd-s-death-minneapolis-police-failed-to-adopt-reforms-remove-bad-officers&lt;/a&gt;
In Minneapolis, policing was supposed to be moderated by use-of-force guidelines (which officers ignored), "coaching" programs (which were inconsistent and chaotic), and automated misconduct detection (whose data the public can't see).
As to why the cops got away with it, consider that the police union boss Lt Bob Kroll kept his job even after he showed up for work with a white power badge on his uniform.
&lt;a href="http://files.courthousenews.com/2007/12/04/MplsPD.pdf"&gt;http://files.courthousenews.com/2007/12/04/MplsPD.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
You might have wondered why Chauvin's colleagues stood idly by as he committed murder in broad daylight. It's a little easier to understand when you know that some of those cops also had long histories of committing violent crimes with impunity.
Like Officer Tou Thao, who knocked out Lamar Ferguson's arrest in 2017, but got to keep his job, even as the taxpayers of Minneapolis shelled out $25,000 to settle with Thao's victim.
Minnesota's state legislature has failed to pass even one of the dozen+ police reform bills tabled in the state house. Meanwhile, the state's Peace Officers Standards and Training Board is a toothless tiger, with no power to sanction or remove criminal officers.
There's a bipartisan consensus on impunity for criminal cops. Think of Bill De Blasio blaming protesters after NYPD officers drove their cruisers through a protest, re-enacting the murder of Heather Heyer.
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/05/31/nyc-mayor-bill-de-blasio-should-resign/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2020/05/31/nyc-mayor-bill-de-blasio-should-resign/&lt;/a&gt;
Or consider how Amy Klobuchar, who, as Minneapolis's top prosecutor, declined to prosecute Derek Chauvin, giving him license to commit a string of crimes that culminated in the daylight murder of George Floyd.
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-killing-officers-derek-chauvin-tou-thao-investigated"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-killing-officers-derek-chauvin-tou-thao-investigated&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TSA boss doubles down on taking away health care from part-time screeners (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/12/boeing-crashes/#sick-system"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
TSA agents handles the personal belongings and touch the bodies of millions of fliers. Part time agents don't get health-insurance. If they think they might have Covid-19, they might not be able to afford to seek care.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/politics/tsa-health-care-part-time/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/politics/tsa-health-care-part-time/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
TSA chief David Pekoske told Congress that the Trump administration's decision to take away health-care from part time TSA employees was a good one: "I have no intention of restoring health care coverage for part-time workers. I think that was a good decision."
About 100 TSA agents have been sent home after it was believed they came into contact with Covid-19. The TSA will not try to track down passengers who also might have come into contact with sick people.

My book Radicalized is a finalist for the Canada Reads national book prize. Each of the five finalists is defended by a Canadian celeb: my champion is the amazing and articulate Akil Augustine.
Akil just appeared on the @CBC's Canada Reads podcast to give us a preview of his defense, which he will field during several nights of nationally televised debates next week.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/35372507152_11ca6baf0c_c.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A former top Cigna exec rebuts Joe Biden's healthcare FUD (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/12/boeing-crashes/#wendellpotter"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In a recent and important essay, Maria Farrell wrote about the road-to-Damascus conversions that ex-techies are having in which they recant the damaging product design work they did and begin to campaign against their former employers.
&lt;a href="https://conversationalist.org/2020/03/05/the-prodigal-techbro/"&gt;https://conversationalist.org/2020/03/05/the-prodigal-techbro/&lt;/a&gt;
Farrell noted that these techies had missed an important step in their transformation from venal attention mercenaries to noble attention freedom-fighters: they had yet to hit bottom, to truly repent their earlier sins.
They skipped like stones over the waters of privilege, and never sank, unlike so many of their victims.
Contrast those journeys with that of Wendell Potter, the former Cigna exec turned whistleblower, who has devoted decades of his life to revealing dirty tricks and lies. Potter campaigns tirelessly - and shrewdly - for Medicare for All, and is always at pains to point out that the anti-M4A talking points his adversaries parrots were all developed by him, when he was on the wrong side of history.
Take this thread, rebutting Joe Biden's FUD about M4A, delivered in the midst of a pandemic that has been worsened by the 77 million un- and underinsured people who can't get care or screening and disproportionately work in food-service and cleaning.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wendellpotter/status/1237438497218105344"&gt;https://twitter.com/wendellpotter/status/1237438497218105344&lt;/a&gt;
As Potter points out, Biden's assertion that M4A costs $35T is just a lie. Once you factor in the savings of not paying for private healthcare, M4A SAVES at least $450B/year.
&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext"&gt;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext&lt;/a&gt;
Biden's plan to cap premiums on a public option at 8.5% of your income is more than double what M4A would cost you. The corporate plans Biden lionizes shackle good workers to bad employers, and put millions at risk of having their care arbitrarily withdrawn or limited. And, of course, private care doesn't cover much. Surprise bills, deductibles, co-pays, out-of-pockets... Our plan - a blue-chip employer's top-of-the-line Cigna plan - costs us $24K/year.
We're rationing our family's health care because in addition to the $20K/year we're paying out of pocket, Cigna refused to cover a pain procedure that my doc - the most-cited pain doc working in California, who runs a major university pain clinic - says I would benefit from. That procedure might let me get a good night's sleep for the first time in 15 years and allow me to live a more normal, pain-free life. But because Cigna won't cover it, it would cost $55K, which we do not have. So I'm foregoing it.
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a name="bethmole"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/coviddontpanic.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ars Technica's Covid-19 explainer is the best resource on the pandemic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/12/boeing-crashes/#bethmole"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I've been reading Beth Mole's outstanding science journalism for many years and I've always admired it, but even by the high standards of a Beth Mole explainer, this soup-to-nuts Covid-19 explainer is just spectacularly good work.
&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/dont-panic-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-guide-to-the-coronavirus/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/dont-panic-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-guide-to-the-coronavirus/&lt;/a&gt;
Mole's calm and comprehensive coverage relies on the most reliable sources and turns the results of our best evidence-based studies into a coherent narrative, from the disease's origins to its spread to its symptoms to its resolution.
Just this symptom-by-symptom breakdown was enormously informative and filled in a huge gap that I had previously mentally signposted as "flu-like".
According to data from nearly 56,000 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in China, the rundown of common symptoms went as follows:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;88 percent had a fever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;68 percent had a dry cough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;38 percent had fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;33 percent coughed up phlegm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19 percent had shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 percent had joint or muscle pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14 percent had a sore throat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14 percent headache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11 percent had chills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 percent had nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 percent had nasal congestion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 percent had diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than one percent coughed up blood or blood-stained mucus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than one percent had watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The sections on transmission, self-protection, and care during a social distancing lockdown or quarantine are likewise levelheaded, clear and informative.
This is a tab you should just keep open in your browser, IOW. Mole's updating frequently, too.

&lt;h1&gt;Boeing is even worse at financial engineering than they are at aircraft engineering (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/12/boeing-crashes/#boeing"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Boeing is experiencing a potentially terminal slump. Between losses due to its 737 Max scandal (a self-inflicted injury), and the dropoff in travel during the pandemic, it has had to draw down its entire line of credit and institute a hiring freeze.
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/11/boeing-crashes-as-43-billion-in-past-share-buybacks-turn-into-existential-threat"&gt;https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/11/boeing-crashes-as-43-billion-in-past-share-buybacks-turn-into-existential-threat&lt;/a&gt;
Obviously, Boeing can't be blamed for the pandemic.
But you know what is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; the company's fault? Its financial engineering.
Since 2013, Boeing squandered $43 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; on stock buybacks, whose sole purpose was to goose its share-price.
As Wolf Richter writes, Boeing, this "master of financial engineering – instead of aircraft engineering –  blew, wasted, and incinerated $43.4 billion on buying back its own shares."
The company just had to borrow $13.825B. Its shares are down 46% since March 2019.
The entire company - a jewel of American industry - might not survive, because it focused on short-term enrichment of shareholders, rather than safe aircraft or financial prudence.
Reality has a well-known anti-capitalist bias, part MMMLVII.

&lt;h1&gt;Senate Republicans kill emergency sick leave during pandemic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/12/boeing-crashes/#gopandemic"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Senate Republicans have killed emergency sick leave legislation, a move that will force millions of low-waged cleaning and food-service workers to choose between homelessness and potentially spreading Covid-19.
&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-us-republicans-block-senate-bill-new-york-washington-a9395821.htm"&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-us-republicans-block-senate-bill-new-york-washington-a9395821.htm&lt;/a&gt;
The GOP says that paid sick leave will endanger the fragile bottom lines of employers and also that the feds have no money to pay for such a thing - despite finding it easy to blow $2.3 &lt;em&gt;trillion&lt;/em&gt; on tax-cuts for the super-rich.
https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/28/tax-cuts-trump-gop-analysis-430781
They also found $20 BILLION in the senate's sofa cushions to give to the Pentagon, an agency whose auditor found more than a trillion dollars in off-the-books transactions in its financial records.
&lt;a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/12/19/pentagon-finally-gets-its-2020-budget-from-congress/"&gt;https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/12/19/pentagon-finally-gets-its-2020-budget-from-congress/&lt;/a&gt;
Refusing to help poor Americans stay fed and sheltered isn't just cruel, it's lethally reckless, and it demonstrates the moral hazard of oligarchic capitalism. Subsidizing sick-leave would merely afford survival to millions of Americans, after all.
Whereas the crisis that this will produce - a pandemic that is made worse and longer - will cost billions more, but that money will go to the donor-class, the Beltway Bandits whose cost-plus, no-bid contracts will transfer even more money from the poor to the wealthy.
It's disaster capitalism at its worst. The Senate GOP is dooming you and  everyone you love to the risk of disease and death because preventing  that risk would help millions of poor people, whereas creating the risk  helps a handful of ultrarich people.

&lt;h1&gt;The EU's new Right to Repair rules finally come for electronics (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/12/boeing-crashes/#eur2r"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The EU Commission's latest "Circular Economy Action Plan" has enormous significance for Right to Repair and electronics.
&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/pdf/new_circular_economy_action_plan.pdf"&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/pdf/new_circular_economy_action_plan.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
In addition to a host of eminently sensible, long overdue measures (bans on single use items and the destruction of unsold goods), there's a renewed emphasis on electronics, through the "Circular Electronics Initiative".
&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/european-lawmakers-propose-a-right-to-repair-for-mobiles-and-laptops/"&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/european-lawmakers-propose-a-right-to-repair-for-mobiles-and-laptops/&lt;/a&gt;
The initiative mandates that components be reusable, repairable, and upgradable, and requires long-term software support to keep IoT devices useful for longer. These mandates - also long overdue - show that the EU is finally willing to ignore the priorities of Apple and other US Big Tech companies in favour of Europeans' rights to the long-term enjoyment of their property and the right not to drown in e-waste).

For 14 years, Stanford Online High School has been running fully virtual classrooms, with continuous, ongoing improvements in their tech and methods. They've just published a new guide to "the essential steps for preparing to teach online in a short period of time." They're also conducting a series of webinars on the subject.

Currently writing: I'm rewriting a short story, "The Canadian Miracle," for MIT Tech Review. It's a story set in the world of my next novel, "The Lost Cause," a post-GND novel about truth and reconciliation. I'm also working on "Baby Twitter," a piece of design fiction also set in The Lost Cause's prehistory, for a British think-tank. I'm getting geared up to start work on the novel afterwards.
Currently reading: Just started Lauren Beukes's forthcoming Afterland: it's Y the Last Man plus plus, and two chapters in, it's amazeballs. Last month, I finished Andrea Bernstein's "American Oligarchs"; it's a magnificent history of the Kushner and Trump families, showing how they cheated, stole and lied their way into power. I'm getting really into Anna Weiner's memoir about tech, "Uncanny Valley." I just loaded Matt Stoller's "Goliath" onto my underwater MP3 player and I'm listening to it as I swim laps.

It took decades after the passage of America's landmark antitrust laws - the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act - for trustbusting to occur in earnest, and what spurred the action wasn't mere corporate bullying, not just price hikes and labor abuses.
What tipped America over into a state where a leader (FDR) who told activists "I want to do it, now make me do it" found the political will to "do it" was the corruption that attended the extreme concentration of wealth.
Monopoly was never merely an issue of economics - it's fundamentally an issue about &lt;em&gt;politics&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, the monopolist bleeds workers and suppliers, sucks them dry and amasses a tremendous fortune, but that's just accumulating ammunition.
What the monopolist does with that ammunition is far more consequential: when the powerful are small in number and command vast fortunes, they can come to a consensus about how to deploy their fortunes to corrupt the political process.
The economic harms are just a warmup, the political harms are the real deal.
Hoover was beholden to plutes, had a cabinet full of them, turned over the nation's treasury to a sociopathic monster called Andrew Mellon whose stated ambition was to own all the world's aluminum.
And so, as the Depression raged, as the nation's breadbasket turned to dust and blew away, as the country disintegrated and as veterans of the Great War starved, Hoover continued to make policy on behalf of the 1%, immiserating the country.
FDR won the election in 1932 - but even more compellingly, Hoover lost it. The nation wasn't just angry about the economy - they were furious about politics, about the fiddling indifference of the rich and powerful to the collapse of their lives, fortunes and future.
The trustbusting tradition endured for generations, and it treated inequality, monopoly and wealth concentration as political problems, as the visible sign of an imminent takeover of the nation by self-styled neo-aristocrats whose wealth was evidence of greed, not ingenuity.
It was Ronald Reagan who made America's official position that wealth was virtue and virtue was wealth - the plute's circular logic that the system works if it elevates the best people, and that they, the elevated were therefore the best.
Reagan, his court sorcerer Robert Bork (a disgraced Nixon administration criminal) and the Chicago School of economists reframed monopoly as a purely economic matter, altering the rules so that monopolies were only prevented or punished if they made prices go up.
The "consumer welfare" version of antitrust abandoned all political questions - questions that every person had a legitimate say in - in favor of complex economic models that they alone could create and interpret.
Thus they could act as modern haruspices, who would evaluate every monopoly question by staring into the inscrutable guts of an equation and then pronounce that the gods approved of the monopoly.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/M418879_Haruspex-studying-the-entrails-of-a-animal-sacrificed-in-ancient-Rome.jpeg"/&gt;
The result was the steady encroachment of priorities of the wealthy into the political sphere, so that Boeing could self-certify its flying deathtraps, Purdue could lie about its murder pills, bailed out banks could robosign your house right out from under you.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/EsbTXctU4AIQ3jy.png"/&gt;
When people embraced conspiracies about vaccines or aerospace companies or impunity for rich sexual predators, we blamed "online radicalization" for exposing the traumatized and desperate to false explanations for their misery - rather than blaming immiserating corruption.
Wealth is power, and it's unaccountable power that allows it to corrupt without check. That sounds abstract, so let me make it concrete by talking about the Epleys, a powerful and fearsome family that dominates New York State's Hamptons.
The Epleys were longtime allies of Southampton Mayor Michael Irving, who was trounced by Jesse Warren in a Jun 2019 election. Warren went on to remove Zach Epley from Southampton's planning board, as is his prerogative as mayor.
&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/23/southampton-ny-mayor-squatting-in-his-home-landlord/"&gt;https://nypost.com/2021/01/23/southampton-ny-mayor-squatting-in-his-home-landlord/&lt;/a&gt;
In October 2019, Epley left a voicemail message for Warren, telling the mayor that it was "game on."
Last July, the Epleys bought the house Warren rents from a Citibank exec called Brandt Portugal.
After initial saber-rattling, the Epleys pledged to leave their new tenant Warren alone, but then Zach Epley lost a local Village Board election to a candidate that Warren had backed. Then the gloves came off.
Warren was also unable to renew his lease for his home in October, but New York State's eviction moratorium protects him.
Warren continued sending rent checks to the Epleys, but they claimed the certified letters never arrived - so they served him with eviction papers.
Eviction would end Warren's residency in Southampton and thus his eligibility to run again for mayor. On Jan 16, Zach Epley and his father Mark Epley (formerly the town mayor) showed up to demand that Warren leave in an absurd encounter that was recorded and posted online.
Warren has closed on a new home in town and will be moving at the end of the month.
On the one hand, this is a spicy story about small town politics, but on the other, it's a tale of how money becomes power becomes corruption.
A powerful family of sore losers can turn their wealth into the power to evict the mayor and thus expel him from town  and end his political career in town - it's a perfect microcosm for how money can undo the democratic will of the people.
And that's why inequality is bad: not merely because the wealthy hoard the resources the rest of us need, nor because the alleged prosperity that allowing these soi-dissant giants direct our resources never materialized.
But because wealth is power without accountability, and that power corrupts.
The Epleys are why Reagan and Bork were wrong: wealth concentration was never solely (or even primarily) an economic matter.
It's always been political.

There are no libertarians in a bank run. No sooner had venture capitalists whipped each other into a terrified Twitter frenzy at the imminent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank - a collapse caused by that selfsame frenzy - than the Ayn Rand-poisoned elite of Sand Hill Road started begging for Uncle Sucker to open the sluicegates:

Now, on the one hand, it's easy to dismiss these guys as very, very, very stupid. After all, they played a game of prisoner's dilemma in which they were allowed to talk to each other as much as they wanted - and they still sold each other out:

But they still have the common sense to realize that in an America where $10k in student debt cancellation, school lunches for hungry children, and library budgets are out of reach, handing billions to a bank rescue a balance sheet overwhelmingly made up the investments of "high net worth" investors wouldn't be popular.
After all, these guys have been crying about incipient guillotinism for years:
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-08/billionaire-cartier-owner-sees-wealth-gap-fueling-social-unrest"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-08/billionaire-cartier-owner-sees-wealth-gap-fueling-social-unrest&lt;/a&gt;
Sure, they don't compare small rises in the top marginal tax-rate to Kristallnacht anymore:
&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/01/26/266685819/billionaire-compares-outrage-over-rich-in-s-f-to-kristallnacht"&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/01/26/266685819/billionaire-compares-outrage-over-rich-in-s-f-to-kristallnacht&lt;/a&gt;
But they are locked and loaded for The Event, feathering elaborate subterranean, antipodean nests in the most luxurious bunkers New Zealand has to offer, against the day that the poors come to eat them:
&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/15/business/bunkers-new-zealand-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/15/business/bunkers-new-zealand-intl-hnk/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
So amid the clamor for socialism-for-the-rich, these billionaires went on the hunt for average joes who could serve as the face of the bailout. Like the "Ohio mom with 4 kids and a husband who works in manufacturing, who owns a small business:"
&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mother-small-startup-ceo-fall-svb-not-1-problem-2023-3"&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/mother-small-startup-ceo-fall-svb-not-1-problem-2023-3&lt;/a&gt;
She's ex-McKinsey and raised $4m in VC for a $600/month life-planning app; her husband, another McKinsey alum, is a senior manager at a steel company (that is, he "works in manufacturing").
Clearly, the ex-libertarian 0.01 percenters begging for relief needed to find someone else. Enter David Sacks, a billionaire Paypal mafioso who waded into the debate with screenshots of an email from a "small, non-profit school" that would miss payroll if the bailout was not forthcoming:
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1636054055121453057"&gt;https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1636054055121453057&lt;/a&gt;
Sacks held this up as evidence that SVB's depositors were "more diversified than the media narrative has allowed." Sacks went on to claim that the bailout saved "innocent bystanders" like "teachers" from being "laid off."
What is this small, nonprofit school? Writing in &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, Luke Goldstein sleuths it out: the "small, nonprofit school" is North Country School, an upstate New York boarding school where tuition runs $62k/year - more than Harvard or Yale:
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-22-david-sacks-bank-bailout/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-22-david-sacks-bank-bailout/&lt;/a&gt;
North Country sounds like a great place to get an education. It's got its own private ski-slope. The local city raised a $7m municipal bond on its behalf. There's a rock-climbing range and horseback riding. The school emphasizes unstructured, outdoor education, with "farming, wilderness trips...even maple sugaring":
&lt;a href="https://northcountryschool.org/"&gt;https://northcountryschool.org/&lt;/a&gt;
Let's be honest, this is the kind of education a lot of us dream of our kids having. No wonder that the alumni include numerous Rockefellers, and a scion of the Aga Khan family - claimed lineal descendants of the Prophet Muhammad.
As illustrious as the student body is, the trustees are even more gilt-edged. There's a former Jpmorgan managing director, a former Google exec, Austrian nobility, the Welch's grape heir and even JD Salinger's kid. The chair ran a booze delivery company that sold to Uber. Together, they manage $30m in assets and raise $3m/year in donations, on top of $9m/year in revenues.
As Goldstein points out, it might be a lot to ask of the median small, nonprofit school trustee to investigate the soundness of the school's bank. But these aren't the median trustees of the median school. They're raising millions from Vanguard and Fidelity and the JM Kaplan Fund. Perhaps it's not asking too much that high-flying financiers craft a risk management plan for their deposits - or, you know, just have the nous not to stash all their money in a single bank account, diversifying their risk the way that any financial planner would tell them to do.
According to Sacks, if the FDIC had frozen SVB withdrawals, or imposed a 10 percent haircut on depositors with more than $250k in the bank, the "modestly paid workers who tend not to have a lot of savings to fall back on" who worked at the school would have been out in the cold. But with donors on tap who give $50,000 at a pop, it seems likely that the trustees could have tapped someone for a bridge loan.
It's doubtless true that there are low-waged, precarious workers who would have been out in the cold if the FDIC hadn't stepped in, but the wealthy "investors" who clamored for the bailout spent the last several years consistently, brutally, loudly calling for an end to covid relief, no student debt cancellation, and cuts to public services. The idea that they were worried about saving the janitors and receptionists of Silicon Valley strains credulity:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich&lt;/a&gt;
You can't be on record calling for tech billionaires to "Sharpen your blades boys 🔪" ahead of mass layoffs and also claim to be a champion of the middle-class:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/21/tech-workers/#sharpen-your-blades-boys"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/21/tech-workers/#sharpen-your-blades-boys&lt;/a&gt;
As Goldstein writes, "David Sacks couldn’t find a mom-and-pop institution to justify his cockeyed version of reality without turning to a VC colleague’s ultra-rich boarding school." There might be mom-and-pop institutions on the SVB balance-sheet, but David Sacks evidently doesn't know any of them.
New York State is a good place to be a Silicon Valley banker. For one thing, the Southern District of New York is an exceptionally nice place to be a bankrupt billionaire, which is why SVB's investors now claim that their headquarters are at 387 Park Ave, 2,951 miles from the Santa Clara HQ the company listed on all its filings:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich&lt;/a&gt;
In New York, elite boarding schools get federal rescues, so long as they can claim some nexus with SVB. But, as Goldstein writes, NY city and state schools are in outright financial crisis, with no aid in sight. The State University of New York system is drowning in debt. NYC schools are about to bring down massive layoffs, having lost $469m out of their budgets:
&lt;a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/testimony-of-new-york-city-comptroller-brad-lander-to-the-new-york-city-council-committee-on-education-on-resolution-283-2022-to-immediately-reverse-doe-reductions-to-school-budgets-for-fy-2023/"&gt;https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/testimony-of-new-york-city-comptroller-brad-lander-to-the-new-york-city-council-committee-on-education-on-resolution-283-2022-to-immediately-reverse-doe-reductions-to-school-budgets-for-fy-2023/&lt;/a&gt;
The FDIC stepped in to rescue SVB, claiming that it wouldn't cost the public anything - instead, the money would come from increases in the entire bank system's insurance premiums. But as Adam Levitin writes for Credit Slips, banks "will pass those premiums through to customers because the market for banking services is less competitive than the market for capital...higher costs for increased insurance premiums are likely to flow to the least price-sensitive and most 'sticky' customers: less wealthy individuals"
"So average Joes are going to be facing things like higher account fees or lower APYs, without gaining any benefit. Instead, the benefit of removing the cap would flow entirely to wealthy individuals and businesses. This is one massive, regressive cross-subsidy."
&lt;a href="https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2023/03/the-regressive-cross-subsidy-of-uncapping-deposit-insurance.html"&gt;https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2023/03/the-regressive-cross-subsidy-of-uncapping-deposit-insurance.html&lt;/a&gt;
Nothing about this bailout intrinsically protects anyone's job. Yes, if the companies that banked with SVB went under, they'd have fired everyone. But tech companies are firing everyone &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;, 280,000 and counting, in &lt;em&gt;profitable&lt;/em&gt; companies where they do stock-buybacks big enough to pay every worker's salary for the next quarter-century:

&lt;h1&gt;SVB bailouts for everyone - except affordable housing projects (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/15/socialism-for-the-rich/#rugged-individualism-for-the-poor"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
For the apologists, the SVB bailout was merely prudent: a bunch of innocent bystanders stood in harm's way - from the rank-and-file employees at startups to the scholarship kids at elite private schools that trusted their endowment to Silicon Valley Bank - and so the government made an exception, improvising measures that made everyone whole without costing the public a dime. What's not to like?
But that account doesn't hold up to even the most cursory scrutiny. Everything about it is untrue. Take the idea that this wasn't a "bailout" because it was the depositors who got rescued, not the shareholders. That's just factually untrue: guess where the shareholders kept their money? That's right, SVB. The shareholders of SVB will get billions in public money thanks to the bailout. &lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich&lt;/a&gt;
But is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; public money? After all, the FDIC payouts come from a pool of funds raised from all of America's banks. The billions the public put into SVB will be recouped through hikes on the premiums paid by every bank. Well, sure - but who do you think the banks are going to gouge to cover those additional expenses? Hint: it's not going to be the millionaires who get white-glove treatment and below-cost loans. It'll be the working people whom the banks steal billions from every year in overdraft fees - 78% of these are paid by 9.2% of customers, the very poorest, and they amortize to a 3,500% loan:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/22/ihor-kolomoisky/#usurers"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/22/ihor-kolomoisky/#usurers&lt;/a&gt;
As Adam Levitin put it on Credit Slips:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  They will pass those premiums through to customers because the market for banking services is less competitive than the market for capital. In particular, the higher costs for increased insurance premiums are likely to flow to the least price-sensitive and most “sticky” customers:  less wealthy individuals.  So average Joes are going to be facing things like higher account fees or lower APYs, without gaining any benefit. Instead, the benefit of removing the cap would flow entirely to wealthy individuals and businesses. This is one massive, regressive cross-subsidy. It's not determinative of whether raising the cap is the right policy move in the end, but this is something that should be considered.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2023/03/the-regressive-cross-subsidy-of-uncapping-deposit-insurance.html"&gt;https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2023/03/the-regressive-cross-subsidy-of-uncapping-deposit-insurance.html&lt;/a&gt;
The SVB apologists display the most curious and bizarre imaginative leaps...and imaginative failings. For them, imagining that regulators will just wing it to the tune of hundreds of billions in public money is simplicity itself. Meanwhile, imagining that those same regulators would say, "Not one penny unless every shareholder agrees to sign away their deposits" is literally impossible.
This bizarrely inconstant imagination carries over into &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the claims used to justify the SVB bailout - like, say, the claim that if SVB wasn't bailed out, everyone would pile into too big to fail banks like Jpmorgan. This is undoubtably true - unless (and hear me out here!), regulators were to use this failure as a launchpad for &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; banks, and breakups of Jpmorgan, Wells Fargo, Citi, et al.
This is a very weird imaginative failure. America operated public banks. It had broken up too big to fail banks. These weren't the deeds of a fallen civilization whose techniques were lost to the mists of time. There are literally people alive today who were around when America operated nationwide public banks - a practice that only ended in 1966! We're not talking about recovering the lost praxis of the druids who built Stonehenge without power-tools, here.
The most telling imaginative failure of SVB apologists, though, is this: they think that people are angry that the government saved the janitors at startups and the scholarship kids at private schools, and &lt;em&gt;can't imagine&lt;/em&gt; that people are angry that America &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; save anyone else. If you're a low-income student at an elite private school, there's billions on hand to save you - but not because the government gives a damn about you - saving you is a side effect of saving all the rich kids you go to school with.
Likewise, the startup janitors aren't the target of the bailout - they're overspill from the billions mobilized to rescue the personal fortunes of tech billionaires who supply VCs' investment capital. If there was a way to bail out the startups without bailing out the janitors, that's exactly what would happen.
How do I know this? Well, first of all, the "investors" who demanded - and received - a bailout are on record as &lt;em&gt;hating workers&lt;/em&gt; and wanting to fire as many of them as possible. As one of the loudest voices for the bailout said of Twitter employees, in a private message to Elon Musk following the takeover: "Day zero: Sharpen your blades boys 🔪":
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/21/tech-workers/#sharpen-your-blades-boys"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/21/tech-workers/#sharpen-your-blades-boys&lt;/a&gt;
But there's even better evidence that the bailout's intended target was wealthy, powerful people, and every chance to carve out working people was seized upon. When regulators engineered the sale of SVB to First Citizens Bank, they did not require First Citizens to honor SVB's community development obligations, killing thousands of affordable housing units that had been previously greenlit:
&lt;a href="https://calreinvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Community-Benefits-Plan-SVB-CRC-GLI.pdf"&gt;https://calreinvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Community-Benefits-Plan-SVB-CRC-GLI.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Tens of thousands of people wrote to regulators, urging them to transfer SVB's Community Benefits Plan obligation to First Citizens:
&lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/campaigns/petitions/sign-the-petition-save-affordable-housing-keep-the-promises-silicon-valley-bank-made"&gt;https://www.dailykos.com/campaigns/petitions/sign-the-petition-save-affordable-housing-keep-the-promises-silicon-valley-bank-made&lt;/a&gt;
As did Rep Maxine Waters, the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee:
&lt;a href="https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/318_cwm_ltr_fdic.pdf"&gt;https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/318_cwm_ltr_fdic.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
But First Citizens - a bank whose slot in America's top-20 banks was secured through a string of exceptions, exemptions and waivers - was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required to take on SVB's obligations to carry out loans to build thousands of affordable housing units in the Bay Area and Boston, including a 112-unit building for people with disabilities planned for a plum spot across from San Francisco City Hall:
&lt;a href="https://www.levernews.com/regulators-stiffed-low-income-communities-in-silicon-valley-bank-bailout/"&gt;https://www.levernews.com/regulators-stiffed-low-income-communities-in-silicon-valley-bank-bailout/&lt;/a&gt;
All those people who wanted SVB's community development obligations to carry forward vastly outnumbered the people calling for billionaires portfolio companies to be saved - but they merely spoke on behalf of people who sought the most basic of human rights - shelter. No one listened to them. Instead, it was the hyperventilating all-caps "investors" who spent SVB's no-good weekend shouting on Twitter about the fall of civilization who got what they wanted, with a bow on top, and a glass of publicly funded warm milk before bed.
The US finance sector is reckless to the point of being criminally negligent. It constitutes an existential risk to the nation. And yet, every time it gets into trouble, regulators are able to imagine &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; to shift their risks to the public's shoulders.
Meanwhile, everyday people are frozen out. School lunches? Unaffordable. Student debt cancellation? Inconceivable. Help for the hundreds of thousands of NYC schoolchildren whose schools are facing a $469m hack-and-slash attack? That's clearly impossible:
&lt;a href="https://council.nyc.gov/joseph-borelli/2022/09/06/nyc-council-calls-for-mayor-adams-doe-to-fully-restore-469m-in-school-funding/"&gt;https://council.nyc.gov/joseph-borelli/2022/09/06/nyc-council-calls-for-mayor-adams-doe-to-fully-restore-469m-in-school-funding/&lt;/a&gt;
When it comes to helping everyday people, American elites and their captured champions in the US government have minds that are so rigid and inflexible that it's a wonder they can even dress themselves. But when the fortunes and wellbeing of the wealthy and powerful are on the line, their minds are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; open that some of their brains actually leak out of their ears and nostrils:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/15/mon-dieu-les-guillotines/#ceci-nes-pas-une-bailout"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/15/mon-dieu-les-guillotines/#ceci-nes-pas-une-bailout&lt;/a&gt;
Every bank merger is supposed to come with a "public interest analysis." But these analyses are "perfunctory." They needn't be:
&lt;a href="https://openyls.law.yale.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.13051/8305/Kress_Article._Publication__1_.pdf"&gt;https://openyls.law.yale.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.13051/8305/Kress_Article._Publication__1_.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
First Citizens got a hell of a bargain: it paid &lt;em&gt;zero dollars&lt;/em&gt; for SVB's assets, its deposits and its loans. Any losses it incurs from its commercial loans over the next five years will be paid by the FDIC, no questions asked. The inability of regulators to convince First Citizens to assume SVB's community obligations along with those billions in public largesse speaks volumes.
Meanwhile, SVB's shareholders continue to claim that their headquarters are a relatively unimportant office in Manhattan, and not their glittering, massive corporate offices in San Jose, as part of their bid to shift their bankruptcy proceeding to the Southern District of New York, where corporate criminals like the Sackler opioid family have found such a warm reception that they were able to escape "bankruptcy" with billions in the bank, while their victims were left in the cold:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich&lt;/a&gt;
Contrary to what SVB's apologists think, the case against them isn't driven by spite - it's driven by &lt;em&gt;fury&lt;/em&gt;. America's "socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor" has been with us for generations, but rarely is it so plain as it is in this case.

&lt;h1&gt;The zombie economy and digital arm-breakers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/02/innovation-unlocks-markets/#digital-arm-breakers"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
It's a zombie economy. For 40 years, we've eroded the wages of workers and transfered their share of profit and productivity to owners of capital. This is a problem, because people need money to buy things, and if they run out of money, they stop buying and profits vanish.
Time and again, capitalism has kicked any reckoning over this down the road. First came the great liquidation: pension cashouts, raided savings, reverse mortgages. Then came consumer borrowing, a tidal wave of unrepayable debt.
That's the zombie part: all the unpayable debt, which has been turned into bonds that enrich debt-holders. As Michael Hudson has told us again and again, debt that can't be paid, won't be paid. Our debt-based economy is the walking dead, a zombie.
We can either stabilize the economy (by forgiving debts, so that producers can pay for necessities and go on producing); or we can stabilize finance (by coercing debtors into destroying their lives in order to keep up on payments):
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#jubilee"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#jubilee&lt;/a&gt;
Think of the loan-shark's arm-breaker: he wants to collect on debt, so he threatens to break your arm. You steal your kid's college fund. You secretly mortgage the house. You sell your wedding-ring. You end up divorced and homeless. You still owe. So he breaks your arm.
Now you're divorced, homeless, and you've lost your ability to earn, and you've got medical bills. He threatens to break your other arm. You start breaking into cars to steal the toll money in the ashtrays. You go to jail. Finally the arm-breaker and his boss are out of luck.
Debts that can't be paid, won't be paid. But as loan-sharks know, fortunes can be collected by applying the right incentives.
Give debtors the choice of immediate ruin from nonpayment, and making a payment today and ruining their lives tomorrow, and they're pay.
They'll pay...until they can't. Because debts that can't be paid, won't be paid.
The zombie economy is the subprime economy. "Subprime" came into collective consciousness thanks to the great financial crisis, where banks tricked poor homebuyers into predatory loans.
The banks knew that the loans couldn't be repaid - they had "balloon" clauses that jacked up payments beyond the borrowers' ability to repay a few years into the mortgage - but they also knew that threats of homelessness are powerful motivators.
The inscrutable equations used to "guarantee" subprime bonds all shared an unspoken assumption: people who face homelessness will go to extraordinary lengths to pay their mortgages. Behind every subprime loan is an arm-breaker.
The zombie economy shambles on. Obama's loan-shark bailout and the eviction crisis let the architects of subprime buy up whole towns' worth of homes and turn them into hugely profitable slums: high-rent, low-quality deathtraps.
&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-housing-invitation/"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-housing-invitation/&lt;/a&gt;
Wall St landlords package rents from subprime rentals into bonds, backed by the loan-shark's guarantee: arm-breakers will evict the shit out of anyone who stops paying.
America-a land where eviction was once a rarity-now faces an eviction epidemic.
&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/forced-out"&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/forced-out&lt;/a&gt;
The foreclosure crisis was only possible because Wall St and the courts collaborated to streamline the historically complicated and time-consuming process of taking away someone's home. Same goes for the eviction epidemic.
It's a simple equation: the more loan-sharks spend on arm-breakers, the lower the expected profits.
Improvements to arm-breaking processes - cost-savings on traditional coercion or innovative new forms of terror - are powerful engines for unlocking new debt markets.
When innovation calls, tech answers. Our devices are increasingly "smart," and inside every smart device is a potential arm-breaker. Digital arm-breakers have been around since the first DRM systems, but they really took off in 2008.
That's when subprime car loans boomed. People who lost everything in the GFC still needed to get to work, and thanks to chronic US underinvestment in transit, that means owning a car. So loan-sharks and tech teamed up to deliver a new lost-cost, high-efficiency arm-breaker.
They leveraged the nation's mature wireless network to install cellular killswitches in cars. You could extend an unrepayable loan to a desperate person, and use an unmutable second stereo system to bombard them with earsplitting overdue notices.
&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/04/17/aa.bills.shut.engine.down/index.html"&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/04/17/aa.bills.shut.engine.down/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
If they didn't pay, you could remotely cut off the ignition and send a precise location to your repo man.
Smart killswitches let you impose fine-grained control over debtors - say, enforcing a rule against driving over the county line.
&lt;a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/miss-a-payment-good-luck-moving-that-car/"&gt;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/miss-a-payment-good-luck-moving-that-car/&lt;/a&gt;
Within a decade, the bond-market for payments from subprime car drivers was edging up on $1T; not because borrowers didn't default, but because they defaulted later, and the car could be easily re-leased to another desperate person.
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U2eDJnwz_s"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U2eDJnwz_s&lt;/a&gt;
The zombie economy shambled on. Tech built undeletable, always-on kill-switches, lo-jacks, and spyware into an ever-expanding constellation of devices, like laptops.
&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/04/rental-company-control/478365/"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/04/rental-company-control/478365/&lt;/a&gt;
Rent-to-own subprime laptops were the epicenter of innovation in digital arm-breaking. Laptops shipped with spyware for covert operation of cameras and mic and access ot files.
That went beyond repoing a laptop! Lenders could make and share covert sex-tapes of their customers!
They spied on children, plundered MP3 collections, stole passwords, read email. It was beyond the wildest dreams of analog loan-sharks.
&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/09/ftc-halts-computer-spying"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/09/ftc-halts-computer-spying&lt;/a&gt;
To make a good digital arm-breaker, you need always-on network connectivity, a device that people really depend on, and a strong presumption that the device has core software that its owner is never allowed to remove.
Basically, a smartphone.
Mobile carriers were early to this party. They collaborated with device manufacturers to create a "subsidized phone" market. They would "give" you a phone in exchange for a long-term, abusive contract, and then repo it by terminating service if you missed payments.
This was only possible because the manufacturers helped, creating phones that could be locked to a single network, so you couldn't un-repo your phone by sliding in someone else's SIM.
They relied on the "anti-circumvention" laws that the music industry lobbied for in the late 90s (like Section 1201 of the DMCA) to make it a felony to unlock these phones. Arm-breaking is a lot easier if it's a felony to evade the arm-breaker.
The smarter the phones got, the more subprime opportunities there were. Remember, there's a new market in every arm-breaking innovation and in every arm-breaking efficiency.
Which brings me to India.
India has a huge subprime market. As one of the world's inequality capitals, whose national government runs on performative culture war bullshit and giveaways to the super-rich, it's a land ripe for subprime innovation.
Phone manufacturers like Samsung are key to India's vast collateralized subprime smartphone market: first-time buyers get their phones on the installment plans at predatory interest rates so high that most will default:
&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/loans-that-hijack-your-phone-are-coming-to-india/"&gt;https://restofworld.org/2021/loans-that-hijack-your-phone-are-coming-to-india/&lt;/a&gt;
Remember: subprime isn't about debts being repaid in full. It's about making borrowers so desperate that they ruin their lives to make payments before they default.
Samsung's uninstallable arm-breaker app allows lenders to brick a smartphone without help from a carrier.
Writing for Rest of World, Nilesh Christopher describes an "escalating series of annoyances" culminating with a full lockout for failure to repay:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;audiovisual prompts in regional languages as reminders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;changing the wallpaper on their cellphones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That escalates to coercion based on analysis of the users' device activity:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For "a prolific selfie-taker," notifications every time the camera is invoked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;frequently used messaging and social apps like Facebook or Instagram are progressively blocked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One step at a time, the phone is made progressively less usable, until it is fully bricked.
It's a fully automated, self-configuring arm-breaker, one that substitutes a thug's unscientific ladder of mounting terror with bloodless, statistical science.
This is probably a good point to mention the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve: any disciplinary technology is tried out on powerless people first, and gradually works its way up the privilege gradient to encompass the whole world.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware&lt;/a&gt;
Debt, after all, is consuming all of us except for the lucky few at the very top of the wealth distribution who have not faced wage stagnation and forced liquidations.
The covid crisis pushed whole countries into subprime status. Pfizer has told poor countries that they can only get access to vaccines if they stake their sovereign assets as collateral to settle claims related to its products:
&lt;a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-02-23/held-to-ransom-pfizer-demands-governments-gamble-with-state-assets-to-secure-vaccine-deal"&gt;https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-02-23/held-to-ransom-pfizer-demands-governments-gamble-with-state-assets-to-secure-vaccine-deal&lt;/a&gt;
And the shitty-tech adoption curve is putting arm-breaking tech into every kind of device, spreading with alarming speed from the bottom of the social order to its apex.
Miss your Tesla payments and your car will lock itself, summon a repo man, back itself out of the parking lot, honk its horn, and unlock its doors for the repo man.
&lt;a href="https://tiremeetsroad.com/2021/03/18/tesla-allegedly-remotely-unlocks-model-3-owners-car-uses-smart-summon-to-help-repo-agent/"&gt;https://tiremeetsroad.com/2021/03/18/tesla-allegedly-remotely-unlocks-model-3-owners-car-uses-smart-summon-to-help-repo-agent/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/2021.3.17-Tesla-Repo-Utah.jpg"/&gt;
As subprime climbs the shitty tech adoption curve, it gets a new name: "software as a service." In a SaaS world, you cannot own the tools of your profession. Adobe Photoshop becomes Adobe Creative Cloud, and any designer who stops monthly payments becomes economic roadkill.
What's more, software is the ghost in the shell, the animating spirit within physical devices. Remove software from a smart device and you don't have a dumb device, you have a brick.
This lets the arm-breakers exert pressure over larger, more powerful entities...like Hoboken, NJ. Hoboken had a payment dispute with the software vendor for its robotic parking garage, so the vendor bricked the garage and took all the cars hostage.
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71554-0.html"&gt;https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71554-0.html&lt;/a&gt;
The strange mutations of arm-breaker tech bodes ill, especially in light of Chekhov's Law: "A phaser on the bulkhead in Act One will go off by Act Three."
The universal spread of devices &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to be remotely repoed - bricked, downgraded, turned into surveillance tools - means that oppressive governments that coerce manufacturers will have the power to reach into our homes, cars and pockets to attack us.
Same goes for unscrupulous insiders - like the subprime laptop jokers making nonconsensual sex-tapes with their customers' webcams - and criminals who can pressure insiders into acting on their behalf.
Nevertheless, subprime arm-breaking is bound to spread, and spread, and spread. Covid forced millions to liquidate everything, left them in precarious, sub-minimum-wage gig work, and there's the millions of evictions waiting for the moratorium to end.
Debts that can't be paid, won't be paid. And yet, people must participate in the zombie economy: they're not going to dig a hole, climb in, and pull the dirt in on top of themselves. There is strong demand for credit on any terms. Any.
Arm-breaker tech unlocks new markets by delaying defaults on unpayable debts. The zombie economy shambles on.

&lt;h1&gt;Dystopia as clickbait (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/15/expect-the-unexpected/#dystopia-is-over"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Writing on tor.com, Christopher Brown proposes that dystopian narratives are a form of clickbait: as the "boundary between dystopian fiction and the evening news" blurs, dystopian narratives become political ads.
&lt;a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/10/14/dystopia-as-clickbait-science-fiction-doomscrolling-and-reviving-the-idea-of-the-future/"&gt;https://www.tor.com/2020/10/14/dystopia-as-clickbait-science-fiction-doomscrolling-and-reviving-the-idea-of-the-future/&lt;/a&gt;
When the NRA wants to scare old white people, they run ads that look movies adapted from  the "second civil war" novels that emerged after 2016, amping up the underlying message of dystopia: to "excuse or encourage our failure to take agency over our own futures."
Brown is a dystopian novelist himself; his recent novel FAILED STATE revisits a world in peril that he documented in two previous novels that blended authoritarian rule and ecological collapse, and finds tantalyzing glimmers of hope.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/12/failed-state/#chris-brown"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/12/failed-state/#chris-brown&lt;/a&gt;
Brown draws a distinction between dystopian sf ("a useful tool to shatter exceptionalist myths and amplify what’s wrong with the world") and weaponized dystopia: "distorts the truth, achieving an effect like those chumbox ads that stroke our darkest fears").
Dystopian sf is especially powerful "when the whole world seems unable to get a handle on what tomorrow will bring" and it is most powerful "when it births a vision of utopian possibility."
("Fighting the Empire is great, but what comes after the Ewok party?")
"As pandemic compounds political uncertainty and climate angst to further confound our ability to get a bead on the present, SF has an opportunity to provide fresh visions of what lies on the other side, help us stop doomscrolling through this dystopian Groundhog Day."
Chris is joining me and Bruce Sterling (who also gets cited in his article) for a event as part of the tour for my new novel ATTACK SURFACE on Oct 19 to discuss "cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk."
&lt;a href="https://www.eventcombo.com/e/Virtual-event-with-Cory-DoctorowAttack-Surface-40932"&gt;https://www.eventcombo.com/e/Virtual-event-with-Cory-DoctorowAttack-Surface-40932&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Trail of Mars (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/15/expect-the-unexpected/#mcdaid"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I first encountered John McDaid through "Uncle Buddy's Funhouse," his 1993 ground-breaking, award-winning hypertext project - one of the first CD ROMs written up in the NY Times. It was such an exciting, original, weird and artistically satisfying piece, especially the music.
Later, John and I became writing colleagues, attending workshops together, and then friends - for decades now. His work remains weird, erudite, accessible, madcap and brilliant.
He's just released a new album of filk/folk music: "Trail Of Mars," recorded during the plague months with an all-star set of session musicians whom John was able to contract with thanks to the unprecedented drought in musical work.
&lt;a href="https://johnmcdaid.bandcamp.com/"&gt;https://johnmcdaid.bandcamp.com/&lt;/a&gt;
The music is both fun to listen to and (obviously) brilliantly performed and mixed, but the standout here is McDaid's lyrics - superb, funny, weird and unexpected poetry in the mode of a Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan in Subterranean Homesick Blues mode.
The top single on the album is "Lost in Translation," a track I listened to three times in a row and have been thinking about ever since:
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ctDcGKgUtw"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ctDcGKgUtw&lt;/a&gt;
The album is $12 on Bandcamp, DRM-free, with a 16-page booklet including lyrics and notes. McDaid is a wild man of enormous and varied talents. Highly recommended.

&lt;h1&gt;Bride of Frankenstein and the Monster (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/15/expect-the-unexpected/#modern-prometheus"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Of all the artwork hanging on the walls of my home, one of my favorites is Brian Ewing's incredible rendering of Elsa Lanchester as the Bride of Frankenstein; it's part of a series of remixes he did of the classic Universal monster gang.
Periodically, Ewing will do something fresh with his design and reissue it - spot color, moire patterns, etc. They're universally great, and they always sell out quick.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Frankenstein.halloween.2020.sparkles.forweb__15028.1602614778.jpg"/&gt;
Today, Ewing's list informed me that he's got new Hallowe'en variants coming of both the Monster and the Bride in runs of 50, with a foil-embossed variant, at $50 &amp;amp; $75 per:
&lt;a href="http://bodega.brianewing.com/halloween-2020/"&gt;http://bodega.brianewing.com/halloween-2020/&lt;/a&gt;
I'm very happy with the version I have, but man, these are tempting!

&lt;h1&gt;The Passenger Pigeon Manifesto (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/15/expect-the-unexpected/#openglam"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In 2014, I gave a keynote at Museums and the Web on the suicide-mission of cultural institutions that had decided to sacrifice access - making their collections as broadly available as possible - for revenues (selling licenses to rich people).
&lt;a href="https://mwf2014.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/glam-and-the-free-world/"&gt;https://mwf2014.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/glam-and-the-free-world/&lt;/a&gt;
I argued that  rich people didn't want museums, they wanted to own the things the museums had in their collections; so if museums eschewed universal access to get crumbs from plutes, they'd end up with rich people slavering to dismantle them and no public to help them resist.
Now,  a group of professionals and institutions from the galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) sector have published the "Passenger Pigeon Manifesto," in which they eloquently make the same point.
&lt;a href="https://ppmanifesto.hcommons.org/"&gt;https://ppmanifesto.hcommons.org/&lt;/a&gt;
"Preservation, the goal of cultural institutions, means ensuring not only the existence of but the access to historical materials. It is the opposite of owning: it’s sustainable sharing. Similarly, conservation is not capturing and caging but ensuring the freedom to live."
Here are their demands:
I. Cultural institutions should reflect on and rethink their roles in relation to access: "Without free, public access, these items will only be objects to be forgotten"
II. Physical preservation is not enough: "To ensure the longevity of digital items, the existence of the highest possible number of copies is required: this can be achieved by sharing through free access."
III. Beyond preservation and providing access, institutions need to communicate the existence and content of their collections, our cultural heritage: "Approachability and good communication is crucial in reaching people"
IV. Publicly funded institutions must not be transformed by the market logic of neoliberalism: "Allow cultural commodities to be archived, described and shared in the frameworks of open access and open science"
V. Liberate and upload all digitised photographs and artworks that are in the public domain or whose copyrights are owned by public institutions: "open by default, closed by exception" (exceptions largely related to respect for indigenous cultures)
VI. All collections should be searchable and accessible in an international, digital photo repository: "the ideal candidate for an independent, central imagebase that provides the widest possible reach is Wikimedia Commons"
100% to all of this. Cultural institutions are about to be HAMMERED by austerity. The 1% are slavering at the thought of looting them and transferring their contents to superyachts and luxury bunkers.
Fuck.
That.
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;a name="drm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/c2mcnhvc4fs51.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bricked Ferrari (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/15/expect-the-unexpected/#drm"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
DRM is a system for prohibiting legal conduct that manufacturers and their shareholders don't like.
Laws like the US DMCA 1201 (and its equivalents all over the world) ban tampering with DRM, even if no copyright infringement takes place.
That means that manufacturers can design products so that doing things that displease them requires bypassing DRM, and thus committing a felony. It amounts to "felony contempt of business model."
The expansive language of DRM law makes it a crime to break DRM, to tell people how to break DRM, to point out defects in DRM (including defects that make products unsafe to use), or to traffick in DRM-breaking tools.
Beyond mere profiteering, though, DRM has more insidious consequences: it creates a world where using objects in ways that suit you can be a literal crime, even if those uses have NO impact on the company's bottom line.
For example, EME is a video encryption standard approved by the W3C. It has many accessibility tools built in, but only those that manufacturers and committee-members thought people with disabilities needed.
If your disability isn't on the list, you can't adapt video without risking felony prosecution (there was a popular proposal to legally require the companies that made the standard promise not to attack people with disabilities for doing this, but they rejected it).
So if you have photosensitive epilepsy, you can't write (or pay someone to write) a filter that looks ahead in video-streams for seizure-triggering effects and block them. You can beg the companies to do this, but you can't do it yourself.
"Legitimate things that the designers didn't anticipate" is an expansive category! For example, Medtronic is one of the largest med-tech companies in the world (thanks to a series of mergers that also allowed it to dodge its taxes).
Despite having been founded as an independent med-tech repair shop, the company is waging bitter war against independent service, so that hospitals must pay its - high-priced - technicians to service their equipment.
Medtronic's PB840 ventilators are the most common ventilators in the world. The pandemic has spiked demand for PB840s even as it has grounded Medtronic's authorized technicians and busted the supply-chain of official parts.
Independent techs are doing life-saving work fixing PB840s, scavenging parts from multiple units. To do this, they have to risk five-year prison sentences, using black-market DRM-breaking tools made by a lone Polish hacker and sent around the world.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again&lt;/a&gt;
There are so many contingencies that design teams can &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; anticipate, and there are also some that they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; anticipate. The omissions and blind-spots of companies are bad enough, but when correcting them is a felony, it gets really stupid and ugly.
No one is immune. Consider this tale by Redditor Zeromindz, about a wealthy Ferrari owner whose car-seat installation bricked a performance car.
&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/j914fh/dude_comes_straight_from_the_dealership_for_a/"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/j914fh/dude_comes_straight_from_the_dealership_for_a/&lt;/a&gt;
The car was designed to lock the engine if it detected "tampering" and the only way to unlock it afterwards was via the car's built-in cellular modem. However, the work was being done in an underground garage where there was no cell service.
A Ferrari technician flew in, but couldn't fix the $500,000 car. Eventually they managed to release the brake and a team of workers pushed the car up the ramps and into range.
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/j9jim1/update_theyve_flown_a_very_italian_sounding/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/j9jim1/update_theyve_flown_a_very_italian_sounding/&lt;/a&gt;
But then they discovered that some part of all that work had permanently bricked the car. It had to be hoisted onto a flatbed and returned to the dealer.
&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/j9qnh3/final_update_and_there_it_goes_boys_a_true_marvel/"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/j9qnh3/final_update_and_there_it_goes_boys_a_true_marvel/&lt;/a&gt;
This is darkly comic, to be sure, but it's also a reminder of the dangers of allowing companies to create an everything-not-forbidden-is-mandatory system for their products.
Under normal market conditions, some enterprising soul would be making and selling "Ferrari unbricking devices" and mechanics would keep one in a drawer, just in case. Instead, a company's war for excess profits becomes a war on unexpected customer situations.
There's a saying: "If you're not paying for the product, you're the product." That's wrong. Someone paid $500k for this product. Their ability to use it as they see fit is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; contingent on the forbearance of a multinational corporation.
Better to say: "If a company can make you the product, you are the product." If monopolies or DRM-law (which creates and reinforces monopoly) can force you to arrange your affairs to benefit them, not you, they will.
That, after all, is the ultimate grift - the &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; grift. The con that says that you are a lawless cur for having the temerity to have pockets full of money that, legally speaking, the grifter should have.

&lt;h1&gt;The Dennis Ball Show (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/15/expect-the-unexpected/#dennis-ball"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
A great hero of the copyright wars is djBC, AKA Bob Cronin, creator of the amazing groundbreaking Beastles mashups, a virtuosic combination of the Beastie Boys and The Beatles:
&lt;a href="http://djbc.net/thebeastles/completebeastles/"&gt;http://djbc.net/thebeastles/completebeastles/&lt;/a&gt;
Cronin's new project is VERY different. He's hosting a Youtube channel starring a dad-joke-cracking tennis-ball puppet called The Dennis Ball Show.
We recorded an episode last month that was nominally about my new book but swiftly became a discussion of the Haunted Mansion.
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fi2VluLarg"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fi2VluLarg&lt;/a&gt;
In fact, we talked for so long that we shot past his self-imposed length cap and so the signature Dad Joke segment was relegated to a second, short coda episode:
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca__jbKWJc8"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca__jbKWJc8&lt;/a&gt;
It's 2020. Everything is terrible and on fire. But the world still turns, and remains full of extraordinary things, like a chance to talk to a tennis-ball puppet wielded by an illegal art pioneer about history's greatest dark-ride followed by hot lashings of dad jokes.

Thanks to the bipartisan consensus that monopolies are good, actually, the entire wireless sector has merged into four companies, each more incompetent - and structurally important - than the last.
The combination of size, importance and incompetence is deadly indeed. These companies know where we go, who we talk to...everything about us. We entrust them with our public safety and national security. The person who hijacks your phone hijacks your life.
The carriers are so bad at this. Hence "SIM-swapping," where criminals bypass your SMS-based two-factor auth to break into your online accounts and steal everything you own, millions at a time, with help from badly paid and badly supervised insiders.
&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wave-of-sim-swapping-attacks-hit-us-cryptocurrency-users/"&gt;https://www.zdnet.com/article/wave-of-sim-swapping-attacks-hit-us-cryptocurrency-users/&lt;/a&gt;
It's not just crooked insiders who victimize us. The companies' top execs get in on the act. They sell your location data on the cheap, to anyone who'll pay for it - bounty hunters, skip-tracers...stalkers.
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile&lt;/a&gt;
The whole industry is a trash-fire. It is built on badly conceived, badly overseen institutions like the Override Services Registry, maintained by Netnumber. The OSR is a powerful, industry-wide database that allows text messages to be redirected from one phone to another.
You'd hope that access to the OSR would be tightly controlled, limited to companies that exhibited the utmost prudence and sobriety, lest thieves hijack your SMS messages, read your secrets, and steal your 2FA codes in order to rob you blind.
Your hopes will be dashed, I'm afraid. There are many, many companies that can access the OTR as part of commercial SMS marketing services. They offer cheap and easy signup. Find one, give it your target's cellphone number, and your phone will get their texts.
Writing for Motherboard, Joesph Cox describes how a security researcher named Lucky225 was able to (consensually) divert his text messages after paying $16 to a company called Sakari.
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber&lt;/a&gt;
This is a bowel-looseningly terrifying vulnerability. After Sakari was contacted for comment, they added the basic, obvious authentication step of calling the subscriber before diverting their SMSes. No fear, many of Sakari's competitors do not bother with this.
As my EFF colleague Eva Galperin told Cox, this is a timely reminder not to use SMS for two-factor authentication or any kind of sensitive message - switch to an authenticator and an encrypted messenging app that's totally isolated from the horrible, lazy, sloppy telcos.
Okey Systems, the security company where Lucky225 is Director of Information, has produced a tool that monitors whether your SMSes are being hijacked. This is a nice tool to have, but we should not need it.

&lt;h1&gt;The People's Parity Project (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/16/wage-theft/#ppp"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
During the Trump epoch, we heard a lot about "Federalist society judges," with the implication that something deep and structural and sudden was shifting in American law.
It was, but there's more to the story.
The Federalist Society is a conservative law movement that proclaims itself to be "originalists," dedicated to interpreting the Constitution according to the lights and intentions of the Framers who drafted it.
Of course, this is nonsense. Just as Biblical "literalists" cherrypick which parts of the Bible they adhere to (they're not eschewing figs, or mixed textiles, or beard-trimmers), Constitutional "originalists" ignore the parts of the Constitution that don't suit their agenda.
What agenda does the Federalist Society have? The same agenda that every conservative has: to elevate a small group of people who were destined to rule over the rest of us, who were destined to be ruled over.
As Corey Robin described in THE REACTIONARY MIND, that is the single factor that unites all the strains of conservativism, from Dominionism to Libertarianism to Monarchism to Imperalism: some are born to rule, others, to be ruled over.
&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001"&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001&lt;/a&gt;
The Federalist Society also satisfies two other definitions of conservative thought.
First, Steven Brust's: "If you think human rights are more important than property rights, you're not a conservative. If you think property rights &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; human rights, you are a conservative."
And second, Frank Wilhoit's: "Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition…There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect."
&lt;a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288"&gt;https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288&lt;/a&gt;
The Federalist Society project was decades in the making:  wealthy conservatives poured money into it, year after year, both in creating a Federalist pipeline at law-schools, then securing positions for baby Federalists in large firms and courts.
As the project of corrupting the courts bore fruit, producing elite-friendly, wealth-friendly decisions that reversed decades of progress against discrimination and exploitation, it gathered steam and supporters and became a lobbying priority across multiple industries.
The Trump appointments were a massive leap forward for the Federalists. Thanks to McConnell's stonewalling on appointing judges under Obama, there were many vacancies to fill, including a Supreme Court seat, when Trump took office.
Now, there's been a change in government and with it, the chance to mitigate the harms these dangerous, ideologue judges will wreak upon the American people as they strip them of their rights and hand more and more power to the wealthy people to whom they owe their power.
There's a mainstream counterforce to the Federalists, the American Constitutional Society, favored by establishment Democrats. The ACS are conservatives, too, in the Corey Robin sense - they differ from the Federalists in terms of whom they think should rule.
That's how the ACS came to seat Amazon's chief union-buster, Andrew DeVore, on his board. He was ousted after public outcry, but he's not unique or exceptional in the ACS's leadership and ideology. They believe in corporate rule as surely as the Federalists do.
But there's a third faction, one that's still nascent, even larval, but is nevertheless showing enormous promise: the Peoples Parity Project, which formed in 2018 amidst the #MeToo movement, first to address sexual predation in corporate law firms.
&lt;a href="https://www.peoplesparity.org/"&gt;https://www.peoplesparity.org/&lt;/a&gt;
The major barrier to dealing with law-firm predators is that lawyers who sign up to work at these firms have to sign forced arbitration waivers, in which they surrender their right to sue in civil court.
Forced arbitration has become widespread since SCOTUS Federalists ruled in favor of it. It is what keeps Uber drivers and many other kinds of workers from suing over wage-theft, sexual abuse, discrimination, and a host of other ills.
Naturally, corporate law firms impose arbitration on their own staff.
Importantly, the PPP fought against forced arbitration not just for lawyers, but for blue-collar workers at large law-firms (predatory execs at these firms are just as happy to assault admin assistants).
This is rare, but growing, and is the most hopeful part of the new labor movement: white-collar, high-waged workers form solidarity with low-waged workers.
See, for example, the solidarity movement between Amazon techies and warehouse workers.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/14/abolish-silicon-valley/#hang-together-hang-separately"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/14/abolish-silicon-valley/#hang-together-hang-separately&lt;/a&gt;
The PPP is less than three years old, but it's already making a difference. As Daniel Boguslaw writes for The American Prospect, these young lawyers have forced the largest corporate firms, like Kirkland and Ellis, to abandon arbitration.
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/justice/taking-on-corporate-law-in-both-parties/"&gt;https://prospect.org/justice/taking-on-corporate-law-in-both-parties/&lt;/a&gt;
They were key to a coalition that has proposed "a vetted suite of progressives for circuit court judgeships" to the Biden administration, and they've built out chapters at over a dozen leading law-schools, from Harvard to NYU to U Mich.
The sudden shift in law that followed Trump's judge appointments wasn't sudden at all - it was the swift culmination of a low, slow, patient project to turn America into an oligarchy, where the few rule the many, where the few are protected by the law, but not bound by it.
The Clintonian takeover of the Democrats and its transformation into a different kind of corporate conservative project meant that the Left version of this slow, patient transformation had no party support - it was incubated outside of the Dems.
But we are at a transformative moment, where the inequality emergency, the climate emergency, the pandemic emergency, the employment emergency, and the health care emergency are all converging.
It's a moment where long, slow patient projects can accelerate, where "ideas lying around" might be picked up and used. It's a moment we can't afford to squander.

&lt;h1&gt;Meet the new music boss, same as the old music boss (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/16/wage-theft/#excessive-buyer-power"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In his 2020 book MONOPOLIZED, David Dayen describes a curious and brutal dynamic of monopolies: they breed monopolies.
"Consumer welfare," the dominant strain of antitrust for the past 40 years, has treated monopolies as innocent until proven guilty.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu&lt;/a&gt;
Companies are allowed to merge with competitors and create vertical silos, so long as no one can prove that doing so has raised prices. The only acceptable proof are the mathematical models invented by pro-monopoly economists, who are the foremost builders of these models.
Strangely enough, these models always prove that the monopoly is good, actually: not harming "consumer welfare." All potential mergers will provably not result in increased prices. All post-merger price-increases are provably not due to the merger.
Anyone who challenges these interpretations is derided for their ignorance of how these models work. Modern antitrust is a priesthood, and whenever a monopoly question arises, they slaughter an ox and read the future in its guts, which only they can interpret.
And strangely enough, the ox guts always favor monopoly.
Now, not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; price-fixing can be waved away as unrelated to market concentration. In some cases, different companies in a sector will literally conspire to set prices, putting it down on paper.
When that happens, you don't need to make a model to show that price rises can be attributed to market power: you have the receipts.
This happens all the time. The record labels documented their CD price-rigging in the 90s, leading to a $67.3m settlement in 2002.
In 2012, the Big Six publishers colluded with Apple to raise ebook prices. They also put it in writing.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Apple_Inc."&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Apple_Inc.&lt;/a&gt;
In most of these cases, the price-fixing is only part of the story. What's actually going on is more complicated: a cartel of manufacturers are conspiring not merely to raise prices, but to fight the predatory practices of a monopolist somewhere else in the supply-chain.
With the labels, it was big box retailers like Walmart. With the publishers, it was Amazon. These monopolists had cornered significant customer-bases for the cartels' products, and the monopolists were squeezing their suppliers for all they were worth - literally.
Here's where it gets funky. Remember that monopolies are innocent until proven guilty, and it's impossible to prove them guilty. If six publishers' CEOs conspire to raise ebook prices, that's illegal. It's collusion.
If one of those six buys two of the others - if Random House buys Penguin and Simon &amp;amp; Schuster - then the former CEOs of those companies (now heads of divisions in a single company) can do &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same thing with little fear of legal reprisals.
Antitrust law rewards monopolies and punishes cartels, so members of cartels merge until they have monopolies.
Which brings me back to David Dayen and his book MONOPOLIZED. The industry Dayen analyzes to demonstrate this phenomenon is US health care.
In Dayen's telling, the first salvo was the mergers-to-monopoly in pharma, producing the Big Pharma giants we have today. These massive, consolidated firm started to lean on their customers, notably hospitals, price-gouging them on medicine.
Individual hospitals were powerless against this pressure: a single hospital that refuses to buy cancer meds at jacked-up prices doesn't get lower prices, it gets dead cancer patients.
But if hospitals teamed up to demand lower prices, that would be illegal price-rigging.
However, if the hospitals all merged into giant chains, they'd be able to push back in two directions. First, they could demand lower prices on drugs from Big Pharma, and second, they could pass on high prices to the insurance sector, which was still decentralized.
Again, the health insurers were not capable of pushing back as individual firms. When all the health care in a single ZIP code is provided by one chain of clinics, hospitals and ERs, an insurer can't declare them all out-of-network - not if it wants to keep its customers.
But once the insurers merged to monopoly, they not only got to push back against hospital price-gouging - they also got to charge higher premiums and deductibles, and they didn't have to worry about losing customers, because there was nowhere to go.
This is really a story of shit flowing downhill - pharma pushes hospitals who push insurers, who push...us. The patients and the front-line health-care workers, from custodians and cafeteria workers to nurses and MDs.
Monopoly breeds monopoly, with each sector of the supply chain concentrating to defend itself against the other sectors, and to exert market power over those sectors that aren't yet monopolized. The only part of the chain that can't organize are workers and customers.
Historically, workers organized in unions to push back against these leveraged assaults on their rights, but the US has all but prohibited unionization.
The public historically organized through politicians who fought for them, but unlimited corporate campaign contributions have made such fights a distant memory.
And so every sector starts to look like health-care: monopolized at every level except for labor and customers.
Writing in Wired today, Ron Knox from the antimonopoly Institue for Local Self-Reliance describes how this dynamic is playing out in music, where the new bosses are all the same as the old bosses.
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-big-music-needs-to-be-broken-up-to-save-the-industry/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-big-music-needs-to-be-broken-up-to-save-the-industry/&lt;/a&gt;
It's not merely the Big Three labels colluding to rip off artists, it's also the tech partners who control distribution, notably Spotify and Youtube.
To the extent that merged-up behemoths like UMG exercise their monopoly power to get more from these digital partners, those excess gains are stolen from the musicians who earned them.
For example, big labels do minimum payout deals with Spotify specifying that millions are owed to them each quarter - but then they accept lower per-stream royalties for their music on Spotify. The result is that massive sums of those guaranteed payouts are "unattributed."
Unattributed revenues are not owed to any artist, so the label gets to keep that money. It's flat-out wage-theft, and it demonstrates the bankruptcy of hoping that a change in monopolists will make lives better for their workforces.
All things being equal, UMG would like to shift as many dollars as possible off of Spotify's balance sheet onto its own. But UMG will not, on its own, hand a single penny of that to the artists whose work generated those dollars
Which is why Knox says we have to break up all these giants - the labels and the digital distribution monopolists, including Youtube and Spotify and Apple and Amazon.
But, Knox points out, that will not be enough.
Because it's not just recording and distribution that are monopolized - it's also performance venues and ticketing (Ticketmaster/Live Nation) and radio (Iheartradio/Liberty Media), whose monopolists are rapacious wage-stealers and fraudsters.
The market can't and won't fix this. Take live performance venues: the vast majority of these are expected to fail thanks to the covid shutdowns. The private sector has a plan to bail them out: former WME exec Marc Geiger raised a vast warchest to buy them for pennies.
He will consolidate them into...a monopolist to push back against the Ticketmaster/Live Nation monopoly. If he pulls it off, he may succeed in shifting many millions from Live Nation's balance-sheet to his own. He will not give any of it to performers if he doesn't have to.
Knox's (correct) conclusion is that we have to have antimonopoly enforcement across the entire supply chain, not just in one or two sectors - from social media to recording to payments to venues to streaming to radio, we have to break them up.
And that might just happen. Two high-profile Biden appointees, Tim Wu and Lina Khan, are on the absolute vanguard of the new antimonopoly movement. Amy Klobuchar's (flawed) antitrust bill goes further than any initiative in years.
And most of all, the musicians aren't alone here. The fight they're fighting is just a part of the fight we're all in: not just every kind of artist, but doctors and patients, cabbies and riders, farmers and eaters.
Our fights have different technical characteristics and different structural remedies particular to those characteristics, but they are, fundamentally, the same fight.
The fight against monopolies.

&lt;h1&gt;Corrected: Chevron bought the US justice system (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#contempt-of-corporation"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please see the end of this article for an important correction.&lt;/b&gt;
You know that free-floating sense that multinational corporations are above the law, able to buy their way out of consequences for even the most blatant, heinous crimes?
There's a (nearly) unbelievable, highly concrete example  of it underway right at this moment.
It's the story of Steven Donziger, a campaigning lawyer who sued Chevron for its ecocide in Ecuador, a genocide against indigenous people, committed with cooperation from a brutal military dictatorship.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/02/free-steven-donziger/#free-donziger"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/02/free-steven-donziger/#free-donziger&lt;/a&gt;
Donziger managed the impossible. He secured a conviction against Chevron, and a $9.8 billion judgment against the company, owed to the indigenous people they poisoned, whose lands and bodies remain poisoned and sick to this day.
Now, if you're an exec at Chevron and you value money more than life, the rational move that proceeds from this judgment is straightforward: any legal maneuver that costs &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than $9.8b is your fiduciary duty to your shareholders.
Give it to Chevron: buying your way out of red-handed genocidal environmental racism is an art form, and they are masters.
First, Chevron paid $2m relocating Ecuadoran judge Albert Guerra to the US, where he testified that the the Ecuadoran fine was the result of a bribe.
Chevron paid for Guerra and his family to move to the USA, paid for his immigration process, paid his income tax, and coached him for 53 days before he appeared in the Southern District of New York Court of Judge Lewis A Kaplan.
Kaplan believed Guerra, and continued to believe him even after Guerra recanted his testimony and admitted that he'd lied at Chevron's behest.
Six other courts, including the Supreme Courts of Ecuadoran and Canada, have upheld the fine against Chevron.
Why would Kaplan believe Guerra after Guerra said he was lying? Maybe it has something to do with Kaplan's own legal background: before he was a judge, he was a corporate lawyer working for a firm that represented tobacco companies in cancer liability lawsuits.
Kaplan used Guerra's testimony to convict Donziger on civil racketeering charges. Chevron brought the charges, and cannily, they dropped their demand for monetary compensation, which meant Donziger couldn't get a jury trial.
But the fact that Chevron didn't seek monetary damages doesn't mean what you'd expect: after Kaplan ruled against Donziger, the judge hit him with an order to pay Chevron millions in court fees.
Worse still, he ordered Donziger to turn over his laptop and phone - not to the court, but to Chevron, who would then get access to his privileged attorney-client communications with the victims of Chevron's ecocide, opening those people to violent retaliation.
Donziger appealed the order. Kaplan then charged him with a misdemeanor for having the temerity to appeal. This was so chickenshit that the District Attorney refused to take up the case, so Kaplan appointed a corporate lawfirm that fronts for Big Oil to prosecute Donziger.
This firm, Seward &amp;amp; Kissel, has a blue-chip roster of climate criminals for clients, including Chevron itself. They are prosecuting Donziger in front of Judge Loretta Preska, whom Kaplan hand-picked to hear the case (he had to violate SDNY procedures to make this happen).
Preska is a member of the Federalist Society, a corporate-backed law organization whose major donors include Chevron.
Donziger is fighting this with his hands tied behind his back. Not only did Kaplan get him disbarred (there's a pending appeal), but he had him &lt;em&gt;arrested&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;s&gt;Donziger is the only person in the entire USA who is in pre-trial detention for a misdemeanor. The only one. He's been under house arrest for more than 580 days. The maximum sentence for the misdemeanor is 180 days. He still hasn't had a trial.&lt;/s&gt;.
&lt;b&gt;Please see the end of this article for an important correction.&lt;/b&gt;
Donziger spoke to Esquire's Jack Holmes about his case, describing how Kaplan has barred him and his Ecuadoran clients from seeking enforcement of the judgement anywhere in the USA.
&lt;a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a35812573/steven-donziger-chevron-house-arrest/"&gt;https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a35812573/steven-donziger-chevron-house-arrest/&lt;/a&gt;
Preska, the Federalist Society judge whom Kaplan picked to hear the contempt charge, has denied his request for a jury trial.
Donziger calls it "corporate political prosecution" and calls himself "a corporate political prisoner."
This is bigger than the judgment against Chevron. As Donziger says, "if you can't do this kind of legal work to hold these polluters accountable, the destruction of the earth will happen at a faster pace."
The corporate takeover of the justice system isn't an abstract conspiracy theory. It is very specific, and it is playing out before our eyes, in a courtroom in New York City.
&lt;b&gt;Correction&lt;/b&gt;: Above, I wrote, "Donziger is the only person in the entire USA who is in pre-trial detention for a misdemeanor." I was quoting Jack Holmes's Esquire interview with Donziger: "I'm the only person in the entire country held on a misdemeanor pre-trial."
&lt;a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a35812573/steven-donziger-chevron-house-arrest/"&gt;https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a35812573/steven-donziger-chevron-house-arrest/&lt;/a&gt;
This is incorrect. Many, many people in America are in pre-trial detention over a misdemeanor. I don't know if Donziger misspoke (perhaps he meant he's had the longest pre-trial misdemeanor detention, at ~600 days, or maybe he was misquoted).
I regret the error and am grateful to the readers who brought it to my attention.

&lt;h1&gt;Chickenized reverse-centaurs (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
AI researchers talk about "centaurs" - machine-human collaborative teams that outperform either computers or people. The greatest chess players in the world are collaborations between chess-masters and chess software.
But not all centaurs are created equal. A "reverse centaur" is what happens when a human is made to assist a machine, rather than the other way around. Amazon may not have invented the reverse centaur, but they perfected it.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/17/reverse-centaur/#reverse-centaur"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/17/reverse-centaur/#reverse-centaur&lt;/a&gt;
Take the "Mechanical Turk," a massive cohort of precarious, sub-minimum-wage pieceworkers who do human decision support for automated processes. There's a reason that South Asian labor activists say "AI" stands for "absent Indians."
Or Amazon warehouse automation: Amazon warehouse robots can't pick-and-pack the items they locate, so they shuttle them to human pickers at a dangerous tempo. The more automated an Amazon warehouse becomes, the more injuries it reports.
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/087fce16-3924-4348-8390-235b435c53b2?shareType=nongift"&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/087fce16-3924-4348-8390-235b435c53b2?shareType=nongift&lt;/a&gt;
Reverse-centaurism isn't the only human-life-destroying area where Amazon leads. It's also a leader in "chickenization," a labor economics term that comes from the US poultry industry, where workers are misclassified as independent contractors.
The poultry packers have divided the country into noncompeting territories, so "independent" farmers only have one vendor who'll take their birds. The farmers have to buy their chicks from that monopolist, who also specs their feed, medicine and housing.
The farmers are told everything - except what they'll be paid. When the farmers bring their birds to market, the monopolist exploits its information asymmetry advantage to offer just enough for the farmer to start over again, but not enough to get ahead or out of debt.
Chickenization is like avian flu: prone to jumping its niche and spreading virulently to every corner of the world. Chickenization is now rampant across all labor markets, from call-centers:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/02/chickenized-by-arise/#arise"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/02/chickenized-by-arise/#arise&lt;/a&gt;
to medical care:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/18/always-get-their-rationalisation/#telehealth"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/18/always-get-their-rationalisation/#telehealth&lt;/a&gt;
Amazon loves chickenization, too. Its Flex delivery program uses employees misclassified as independent contractors, paying sub-minimum wage. The company subjects these drivers to constant overt and covert surveillance.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/02/free-steven-donziger/#chickenized-flex"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/02/free-steven-donziger/#chickenized-flex&lt;/a&gt;
But as bad as Flex is, it's not the end-state of Amazon's innovative workplace terrors. For that, you need to look at Delivery Service Partners (DSP), a workforce of chickenized reverse-centaurs. This is some peak innovation right here.
Writing for Wired, Caitlin Harrington describes the suffocating horror of chickenized reverse-centaurs.
Amazon claims that DSP drivers don't work for them. Instead, they work for "entrepreneurs" who buy Amazon delivery vans and pay drivers to operate them.
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/some-amazon-drivers-have-had-enough-can-they-unionize/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/some-amazon-drivers-have-had-enough-can-they-unionize/&lt;/a&gt;
There are 158,000 DSP drivers, working for 2,500 DSPs. They wear Amazon uniforms and drive Amazon vans. Amazon packs those vans with reverse-centaur gear: Rabbit (realtime tracking), Mentor (automatic driver-scoring) and Netradyne (a mesh of always-on AI spy cameras).
Amazon DSP vans have Netradyne cameras inside and out, including one that is always trained on drivers' faces, performing digital phrenology on them, scoring them based on junk-science microexpression detection and other imaginary metrics.
Now DSP drivers aren't just expected to match an impossible machine pace by limiting water intake so bathroom breaks won't derail the 300 packages they deliver during a 10-hour shift.
Netradyne cameras are next-level reverse-centaurism. They make sure you're not yawning while you deliver 300 packages during a 10-hour shift - and if you do, they deduct points and notify your manager.
And because they're both chickenized and reverse-centaured, DSP drivers are left with little recourse. Amazon doesn't allow any individual DSP to 40 vans. That means that if a DSP's drivers unionize, Amazon can just cut its contract with the DSP and put them all out of work.
Unions are (maybe) finally coming to Amazon's US ops. The union drive at the Bessemer, AB warehouse could be the start of a new era for Amazon and its workers: fair wages and safe working conditions for the workforce that we've all come to depend on.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/19/deastroturfing/#real-power"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/19/deastroturfing/#real-power&lt;/a&gt;
But that won't help DSP drivers win wage- and condition-parity with other drivers in the industry (UPS's unionized drivers make $38/h plus benefits and pensions). DSP doesn't work for Amazon, they work for an Amazon contractor.
But as Harrington points out, there is precedent for this kind of fragmented workforce attaining labor justice. In the 1980s, large firms fired their custodial staff and replaced them with subcontractors working for staffing firms.
The Justice For Janitors movement targeted the companies where these workers showed up for work, not the companies that sent them a paycheck. This got all the subcontractors' janitors ready to unionize: they signed union-cards en masse and doubled their wages.
Justice for Janitors didn't have to contend with the kind of digital controls Amazon has mastered - but they also didn't have access to the Discord and Reddit forums where DSPs are organizing today.
And Biden's NLRB is seeking to strike down Trump's annihilation of the "joint employer" classification that Obama used to force McDonald's franchisees to bargain with their workers.
The 1935 National Labor Relations Act was wise to worker misclassification, and allowed workers to provided service to a company to unionize. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 gutted this protection by excluding contractors from collective bargaining.
Flex drivers - and Uber drivers and other "gig economy" chickenizees - are prisoners to this exemption, and the PRO Act, which is headed for a showdown with the GOP in the Senate, would fix it, restoring the right to unionize.

&lt;h1&gt;Announcing "The Shakedown" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#monopsony"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Back in 2018, I appeared onstage in Melbourne with Rebecca Giblin, a lawyer and researcher who specializes in copyright's relationship to artist compensation for a panel called "How do artists get paid?"
&lt;a href="https://www.wheelercentre.com/events/how-do-writers-get-paid"&gt;https://www.wheelercentre.com/events/how-do-writers-get-paid&lt;/a&gt;
It was a fantastic, intense discussion and even more intense was our chat in the taxi afterwards, where we talked about the specific ways that creative labor markets are open to abuse.
It's not just that people make art for intrinsic reasons and will continue to do so even under miserable circumstances, even if they can do better - it's that copyright is totally inadequate (and sometimes counterproductive) as a labor law.
As creative markets have grown more concentrated - thanks to lax merger scrutiny and an official policy of welcoming monopolies as "efficient" - the bargaining power at every level of the industry has grown more unequal.
A market with one national brick-and-mortar retailer, one global digital retailer, four major publishers, two social media companies, etc etc is not a market that we can fix by handing more copyright to artists.
Giving a writer more copyright under those circumstances is like giving your kid extra lunch money to replace the money the bullies take at the school-gates every morning. No matter how much money you give your kid, the bullies will take that, too.
Think of how Amazon traps writers with Kindle exclusives, which locks their work perpetually to Amazon's own platform using DRM. Or how Disney refuses to pay royalties to writers of bestselling novelizations:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/19/disneymustpay/#disneymustpay"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/19/disneymustpay/#disneymustpay&lt;/a&gt;
Worse: the tech and media companies that operate these "market" monopolies use them to seize creators' &lt;em&gt;artistic&lt;/em&gt; monopolies (copyrights) and then invoke copyright law whenever their dominance is challenged.
Governments might punish a company for its monopoly, but they'll actively help it defending its copyrights. A market monopoly based on creative monopolies isn't just sheltered from legal liability - it can use IP law to punish its competitors.
&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/&lt;/a&gt;
No just monopolies.
Markets dominated by excessive buying-power (monoposonies) are far more common than markets dominated by selling-power (monopolies) and they're &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse for workers, including creative workers.
As Rebecca and I discussed all this in that Melbourne taxicab, something germinated in Rebecca's mind; later, as she pursued her research, she kept returning to those themes. Eventually, she realized she wanted to make a book from them.
Last year, during the pandemic lockdown (much more thorough in Melbourne than LA!), Rebecca and I worked on a book called THE SHAKEDOWN, and this week, we can announce that it will be published by Beacon Press!
THE SHAKEDOWN is a book about the way that excessive buying power in creative labor markets lets giant corporations steal from creators - and how creators can push back.
This isn't one of those "Chapter 11" books, where you get ten chapters of terrible news, and then an eleventh chapter called "What you can do about it," full of anodyne advice about writing to your lawmaker or switching to ethical sellers.
This is a book about historical and novel ways of rebalancing the power of workers against the massive corporations that squeeze them, from unionization to limits on contracting law, from interoperability to licensing regulations.
It lays out the way that creative labor markets from games to movies to books to music to news and beyond have been cornered by rapacious, dishonest giants who use the same tactics that destroy the livelihoods of all kinds of workers.
It connects the struggles of creative workers to all workers struggles, and proposes a theory of change grounded in solidarity and systemic action - while focusing on the distinctive tools available to creative workers.
The book is out in 2022, and we're just finished the manuscript now. I couldn't be more excited about this, and I'm incredibly grateful to Rebecca for her invitation to collaborate with her, and to Paul Lucas for selling the book, and Joanna Green for buying it!

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/chinayoutube.0.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Youtube is automatically blocking criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/27/literal-gunhumping/#communist-bandit"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Youtube's automated filter system is blocking comments critical of the Chinese Communist Party; a Google spokesperson called it "an error in our enforcement systems."
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270290/youtube-deleting-comments-censorship-chinese-communist-party-ccp"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270290/youtube-deleting-comments-censorship-chinese-communist-party-ccp&lt;/a&gt;
Banned phrases include "共匪” (“communist bandit”) and “五毛” (“50-cent party”).
The automated censorship has been taking place for at least six months, when the first support requests appeared on Youtube's own help pages.
&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/17821466?hl=en"&gt;https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/17821466?hl=en&lt;/a&gt;
The issue was brought to prominence this month by the activist Jennifer Zeng.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferatntd/status/1260557177711968257"&gt;https://twitter.com/jenniferatntd/status/1260557177711968257&lt;/a&gt;
As The Verg's James Vincent notes, the censorship is all the weirder because Youtube and Google are banned in China.
Though the company did secretly develop a censoring/surveilling search tool ("Project Dragonfly") intended for the Chinese market, which was (allegedly) killed after googlers strongly objected to it once they discovered its existence.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/e3c7a07fd37526bb00fe0462babbb9deaa72cb3a.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Facebook shelved research that showed they were sowing division (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/27/literal-gunhumping/#joel-kaplan"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Leaked internal Facebook docs reveal that top company execs were told that the company's "engagement algorithm" was sowing division among its users, by feeding people ever-more-fringe versions of their own beliefs.
&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499&lt;/a&gt;
The slides warned that the algorithm served "more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention &amp;amp; increase time on the platform" and  "64% of people who joined an extremist group on Facebook only did so because the company’s algorithm recommended it to them."
Writing in The Verge, Nick Statt attributes the emphasis on controversy to FB VP of Global Public Policy Joel Kaplan, an ex-GW Bush official who attended the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings to give moral support to the accused rapist.
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270659/facebook-division-news-feed-algorithms"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270659/facebook-division-news-feed-algorithms&lt;/a&gt;
Kaplan is Facebook's sop to the right; and he championed Facebook's political ad policy of allowing provable falsehoods to appear in paid political ads. He also sidelined proposals to weaken the influence of hyperpartisan "supersharers," who are disproportionately rightist.
Facebook's marketing material promises advertisers that it can use machine learning and surveillance data to convince potential customers to buy whatever they're selling, but, as with all marketing material, these self-serving claims should be viewed skeptically.
That said, I'm willing to believe that machine learning systems &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; "sort by controversial," making rough judgments about which material is likely to evince anger from readers, just by looking at simple signals like vocabulary choices (e.g. "pro-life" vs "pro-choice").
Sort by controversial is indeed cause for concern - but it's a far cry from the feats of mind-control that Facebook claims it can perform when it is trying to sell its advertising platform to marketers.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/11690708693_3758156a02_k.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hertz's bankruptcy was caused by private equity looting (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/27/literal-gunhumping/#hertz-uranus"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I have a weird soft spot in my heart for Hertz, because they were the first company to offer satnav systems, and since I have a sense of direction so bad that it verges on a cognitive impairment, this saved my ass a million times in the 90s and 2000s.
So I was saddened more than I anticipated by the news that Hertz had filed for bankruptcy, felled by the one-two punch of Uber/Lyft weakening demand for short-term rentals and then pandemic killing demand altogether.
Except, that's not what killed Hertz. The company was killed by private equity looting. Ford sold the company to Clayton Dubilier &amp;amp; Rice in 2005 in a $14.8b "leveraged buyout."
&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/hertz-bankruptcy-6f16b3a4-141f-43cd-8f7b-e6a60a01d5dd.html"&gt;https://www.axios.com/hertz-bankruptcy-6f16b3a4-141f-43cd-8f7b-e6a60a01d5dd.html&lt;/a&gt;
That's when a plutes take out a loan on a company they don't own yet, in order to buy the company. That way, the new owners can suck huge sums out of their acquisition in "special dividends" while saddling the company with unsustainable debts.
PE colonized most sectors of the US economy, draining it of cash reserves and capital assets and drowning it with debt. It's why ER doctors and nurses are being laid off in the middle of a pandemic - their employers are PE companies, not hospitals.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/21/profitable-butchers/#looted"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/21/profitable-butchers/#looted&lt;/a&gt;
It's really hard to overstate how grifty PE is. It is the final stage of late-stage capitalism, in which ever profitable business that provides a useful and beloved product or service is bankrupted, and its assets transferred to the super-rich.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/04/a-mind-forever-voyaging/#prop-bets"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/04/a-mind-forever-voyaging/#prop-bets&lt;/a&gt;
Hertz's leveraged buyout was only six months old when the company paid $1B to its investors, "de-risking" them. A few months later, Hertz went public with a 95% debt-to-asset ratio (!). Swollen with IPO cash, Hertz grossly overpaid in acquisitions of Dollar and Thrifty in 2013.
Meanwhile, its private equity looters quietly "exited," leaving the company drowning in debt and saddled with overvalued acquisitions, its business model structured around grifty, performatively dull financial engineering.
Hertz created special purpose corporations that issued debt to buy cars that were then rented out and leased, while paying "coupons on the asset-backed securities, hoping to turn profits via the rentals combined with vehicle resale."
If you're reading that and feeling stupid because it's written in financial High Elvish, that's exactly how you're supposed to feel. "Baffle them with bullshit" is the only real financial business-model - like any con-artist, the billionaire grifter depends on it.
After all, they don't need to build a business that works - just one that doesn't immediately collapse, remaining upright until the grifter has blown town and deposited his winnings in an offshore account.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/jimjustice.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;West Virginia's governor Jim Justice: billionaire, deadbeat (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/27/literal-gunhumping/#injustice"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Billionaire Jim Justice is the richest person in West Virginia, and he is the state's governor - a position he campaigned for by claiming that his riches proved that he was really good at money management.
But Justice didn't build his coal business - he inherited it (along with his name) from his daddy, and the business's growth since is largely attributable to the fact that Justice is a cheater who does not pay his bills.
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-billionaire-governor-whos-been-sued-dozens-of-times-for-millions-in-unpaid-bills"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/the-billionaire-governor-whos-been-sued-dozens-of-times-for-millions-in-unpaid-bills&lt;/a&gt;
The Justice companies have been named by in 600 lawsuits for nonpayment of bills, in dozens of states. The suits were "filed by workers, vendors, business partners, government agencies." He cheats tax-collectors, manufacturers, workers - even his own accountants and lawyers!
Justice loses these cases, but then he refuses to pay again, forcing his creditors to go back to court over and over again to collect the judgments they're owed.
Some of those frauds kill people. For example, when he stopped paying insurance premiums for his workers' health insurance, doctors started refusing to treat the chronic illnesses and injuries they acquired while working for his companies.
Justice was a deadbeat long before the coal downturn - he started getting sued for nonpayment of his bills in the 1990s. And the lawsuits kept rolling in at an accelerating clip, even after he became governor.
Among those: a settlement with the DoJ to pay $5m in "delinquent mine safety penalties," which Justice had stiffed the DoJ on for years.
Justice's grift started small, with wage theft from coal-miners, but he's not above stealing from his fellow plutes, or Uncle Sam.
Justice is such a crook that even other coal barons think he's unfit to govern. His bid for the governor's mansion was opposed by Bob "Eat Shit and Die, Bob" Murray, an ambulatory colostomy bag in a skinsuit.
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5W06xR8EYk"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5W06xR8EYk&lt;/a&gt;
Alas, he did manage to sucker the leadership of the United Mine Workers of America, who endorsed his gubernatorial campaign -- and whom he later stiffed. They have withdrawn their endorsement.
If you want to explore the $128,000,000 in legal claims against Justice, Propublica's Ken Ward, Jr and Alex Mierjeski have you covered:

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/cummingsog-copyrightbot-hd-3.png.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Twitter's porn filters are dampening discussions of "cumgate" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/27/literal-gunhumping/#cumgate"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Dominic Cummings is the UK prime minister's appointed advisor whose duties included establishing the quarantine rules he spectacularly violated AFTER he believed he had been exposed to coronavirus.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/26/pandemic-profiteers/#private-law"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/26/pandemic-profiteers/#private-law&lt;/a&gt;
The scandal - #cumgate - is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trending on Twitter, despite its dominance of UK politics and the real possibility that it could take down the current government.
Why not? Because Twitter's porn-filters block the word "cum" from trending topics.
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/anti-porn-filters-stop-dominic-cummings-trending-on-twitter"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/anti-porn-filters-stop-dominic-cummings-trending-on-twitter&lt;/a&gt;
People who try to type Cumgate-related hashtags get autocomplete suggestions like "#cummnings, #dominiccummigs and #sackcummimgs". These suggestions have been chosen often enough that THEY have started to trend.
It's an example of the well-known "Scunthorpe" problem, which references a time when chatroom filters would block mentions of the English town because it contains a four-letter epithet.

&lt;h1&gt;Understanding Bayesian reasoning (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/27/literal-gunhumping/#bayesian"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Notwithstanding the old saw about "lies, damned lies and statistics," stats are amazing tools for making analyzing and predicting the outcomes of complex processes. The field's disrepute springs from its counterintuitive foundations, which make stats easy to abuse.
But few fields reward careful study more than stats, both as a form of self-defense from deceptive statistics and as a way to understand the world better.
Of particular import is the work of Thomas Bayes, whose foundational statistical conclusions languished for centuries before being revived as the cornerstone of machine learning techniques.
Bayes's work isn't just for ML, though. It is through Bayes that we can understand why a covid test that is "90% accurate" can ALSO be wrong 66% of the time (no, really!).

In "An Intuitive Explanation of Bayes' Theorem: Bayes' Theorem for the curious and bewildered; an excruciatingly gentle introduction," Eliezer S Yudkowsky devotes 15,000 words to the subject (!).
&lt;a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes"&gt;http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes&lt;/a&gt;
If you find that daunting, try Better Explained's "An Intuitive (and Short) Explanation of Bayes’ Theorem," which I found both informative and straightforward.

There are so many sayings about the foolishness of prioritizing inflicting pain on your opponents - "cutting off your nose to spite your face," "Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die," etc.
Today, I learned a new one.
"Pointing an unsafetied pistol at your own penis with your finger on the trigger to pwn the libs."

I've read through hundreds of comments on Dylan Park's thread in which he identifies the trend, but I remain totally baffled by it.

However, it might be a useful fact to cite the next time a musketfucker explains to me that my skepticism about gun ownership in unwarranted because gun enthusiasts are, by nature, respectful of firearm safety.

&lt;h1&gt;How to pay artists while fighting censorship and Big Tech (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/27/literal-gunhumping/#pay-artists"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Before the pandemic, the music industry was making more money than ever, more than at any time since the CD era in which audiences bought all their favorite music in a new format.
Despite this, musicians were faring worse than ever. It's not hard to understand why: with the music industry controlled by three major labels and a half-dozen Big Tech companies, the billions that music lovers shelled out were being trousered by giant corporations.
What's worse, all the efforts to fix this just entrenched the monopolies in music production and distribution - for example, the EU's Copyright Directive, which annihilates any online distribution platform that can't afford hundreds of millions for copyright filters.
Some musicians' groups hoped it would force tech companies to share fairly. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth - copyright filters trap EVERYTHING, irrespective of whether it infringes, but only Big Content has the direct line to Big Tech to get it unblocked.
Meaning musicians who didn't sign with a label had no hope of independent distribution. And only the Big Tech companies could afford to operate under the new rules. It wasn't a tax on Big Tech, it was a license to dominate the internet...forever.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet&lt;/a&gt;
But there's a better way - a solution that's been tried and proven for more than a century: blanket licenses, like the ones we use for radio, concert halls and other venues, and recorded covers.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/plan-pay-artists-encourage-competition-and-promote-free-expression"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/plan-pay-artists-encourage-competition-and-promote-free-expression&lt;/a&gt;
Here's how an internet blanket license would work:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An online service signs up, paying a fee based on the number of users. If your service has one user, it will pay 1/2.5b of the sum that Facebook (with 2.5b users) pays&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An independent collecting society uses statistical sampling to figure out which music is being played online&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They distribute the money they collect to artists and labels, with a minimum of 50% of revenues going straight to artists, no matter what their contracts say&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Under this system, artists would always get paid, even if they'd been shafted in their contract with a Big Three label. And anyone could start an online music service that would rise or fall based on technical excellence, not the ability to cut deals with labels.
There are a LOT of details that need to be worked out (with all stakeholders) here, like how you keep the collecting society honest, how you measure the accuracy of the statistical sampling system, how you divide music among multiple creators, etc.
I don't pretend that these are simple questions! But they are MUCH simpler than the question of "How do you get musicians paid by shifting a few points from Big Tech's balance-sheet to Big Content's balance-sheet?"
Before the internet came along, blanket licenses ensured that anyone could open a club, start a radio station, or play music in their bookstore. But with the internet, the music industry unwisely decided to replace the principle of blanket licenses with one-off licenses.
The result was auctions that only sold to the highest bidder - with the result that all the other bidders went out of business, and the high bidders stopped having to worry about competition, and used that market power to extract an ever-larger share of entertainment income.
Money talks and bullshit walks. Campaigning for Big Tech to pay the Big Three more is not the same as getting musicians paid. If we want to pay musicians, we should establish a rule that says, "When music makes money, musicians get paid."
NOT: "When music makes money, musicians get paid, provided they were able to negotiate a favorable contract with a monopolist."
This rule doesn't just get musicians paid, it also puts them on the right side of free expression, by ending the need for mass surveillance and trigger-happy automated censorship as backstops for today's dysfunctional mess.

&lt;h1&gt;The Toronto Star's new owners donated to far-right Tories (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/27/literal-gunhumping/#plutewatch"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Toronto Star is Canada's largest-circulating newspaper, a venerable institution that was the inspiration for Superman's Daily Planet. They're a partisan paper in the British tradition, well understood to be in the tank for Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party.
Until now.
The paper (and its other holdings, including the Hamilton Spectator and dozens of other papers) just sold for $52m to a new Manitoba company called Nordstar Capital LP, which promised a "commitment to progressive positions and fearless journalism."
&lt;a href="https://www.canadalandshow.com/political-donations-made-by-new-torstar-owners/"&gt;https://www.canadalandshow.com/political-donations-made-by-new-torstar-owners/&lt;/a&gt;
But as Canadaland revealed, the principles of Nordstar, Jordan Bitove and Paul Rivett, are long-time, major donors to Canada's Conservative party, which has drifted into Trumpian far-right, white nationalist territory.
And among the Tories that Nordstar's principals donated to are those same far-right/white-nationalists. For example, Rivett backed both Maxime Bernier and Doug Ford.

&lt;h1&gt;The seductive, science fictional power of spreadsheets (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/29/gedankenexperimentwahn/#high-on-your-own-supply"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
This week, John Scalzi was kind enough to let me write a guest-editorial for his Whatever blog about the themes in my new crime technothriller, &lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt;; specifically, about the ways that spreadsheets embody the power and the pitfalls of science fiction at its best &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; worst:
&lt;a href="https://whatever.scalzi.com/2023/04/26/the-big-idea-cory-doctorow-2/"&gt;https://whatever.scalzi.com/2023/04/26/the-big-idea-cory-doctorow-2/&lt;/a&gt;
Yes, &lt;em&gt;spreadsheets&lt;/em&gt;. Marty Hench (the protagonist of &lt;em&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/em&gt;) is a 67-year-old forensic accountant who specializes in unwinding Silicon Valley financial frauds, a field he basically invented 40 years ago, when, as a PC-struck MIT dropout, he moved from Cambridge to San Francisco to recover the stolen millions hidden in spreadsheets.
Working through this book - and its two sequels, which travel back in time to the 1980s and Marty's first encounters with VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3 - I was struck by the similarities between spreadsheets and science fiction.
While many people use spreadsheets as an overgrown calculator, adding up long columns of numbers, the rise and rise of spreadsheets comes from their use in &lt;em&gt;modeling&lt;/em&gt;. Using a spreadsheet, a complex process can be expressed as a series of mathematical operations: we put &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; inputs into the factory and we get &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; finished goods. Once the model is built, we can easily test out counterfactuals: what if I add a third shift? What if I bargain harder for discounts on a key component? If I give my workers a productivity-increasing raise, will the profits make up for the costs?
These are the questions that anyone managing a complex system asks themselves all the time. Historically, the answers have sprung from intuition, from fingerspitzengefühl - the "fingertip feeling" of how a system's components work and what their potential and limitations are. But intuition can calcify, become a rigid set of rules that increasingly diverge from the best strategy.
By contrast, spreadsheets yield a set of crisp, instantly tallied answers to any question you put to them. Change the input and watch as that change ripples through the whole system in an eyeblink. If you're adding three more people to your camping trip, will the amount of additional water require renting another vehicle? No need to guess: just check and see.
This has a lot in common with science fiction, a genre full of thought experiments that ask Heinlein's famous three questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this goes on...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These contrafactuals are incredibly useful and important. As critical tools, science fiction's parables about the future are the best chance we have for resisting the inevitabilism that insists that technology &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be used in a certain way, or must exist at all. Science fiction doesn't just interrogate what the gadget does, but who it does it &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; and who it does it &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/20/love-the-machine/#hate-the-factory"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/20/love-the-machine/#hate-the-factory&lt;/a&gt;
One of science fiction's key methods comes from sf grandmaster Theodore Sturgeon: "ask the next question." Ask a question, then ask "what happens next?" Do it again, and again, and again:
&lt;a href="https://christopher-mckitterick.com/Sturgeon-Campbell/Sturgeon-Q.htm"&gt;https://christopher-mckitterick.com/Sturgeon-Campbell/Sturgeon-Q.htm&lt;/a&gt;
This technique produces excellent, critical ways of interrogating technological narratives - check out this delightful example of the possible pipeline from self-driving cars to ransomware gangs to mutual aid societies to the reinvention of the train:

The commonalities between sf and spreadsheets don't stop there - sf and spreadsheets share &lt;em&gt;pitfalls&lt;/em&gt;, too. A spreadsheet is a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; and a model is &lt;em&gt;not the thing it models&lt;/em&gt;. The map is not the territory. Every time a messy, real-world process is converted to a crisp, mathematical operation, some important qualitative element is lost.
Modeling is an intrinsically lossy operation. That's why "all models are wrong, but some models are useful." There is no process so simple that it can be losslessly converted to a model. Even the actions of the nanoscale transistors in a microchip, which toggle between "0" and "1," are rarely in a state of "no voltage" and "voltage." That clean, square-wave line that's used to describe what happens in a chip is a lie - that is to say, it is a model.
The wave isn't square, it's a squiggly line that hovers &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; zero and &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; one. Under normal circumstances, "zero" and "zero-ish" is a distinction without a difference. But when computers go wrong, it's sometimes because a sufficiently ambiguous "zero-ish" acts like a "one." That's true all the way up the stack. On engineering diagrams, the nanoscale lines that electrons travel along inside a chip are represented as sharp paths, the kind of thing a Tron-cycle would lay down. But in the real world, we get all kinds of weird effects at that scale - electrons sometimes &lt;em&gt;tunnel through&lt;/em&gt; those lines, performing a spooky quantum trick that reminds us that Newtonian physics is also just a model.
Every real-world phenomenon contains qualitative and quantitative elements, but computers can only do math on the quantitative parts. This creates a powerful temptation to incinerate the qualitative and perform operations on whatever dubious quantitative residue is left in the crucible, often with disastrous results.
Remember during lockdown, when a pair of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign physicists produced a model of covid spread that predicted that the campus could safely reopen, predicting no more than 500 cases over the entire semester and no more than 100 cases at any one time? The physicists were openly contemptuous of their epidemiologist peers, saying that this kind of model making lacked the "intellectual thrill" of real science.
UI was so swayed by the crisp, precise model that they invited students back to campus - only to shut down again in a matter of weeks, with &lt;em&gt;780&lt;/em&gt; active cases on campus and more rolling in every day.
The model reduced qualitative factors - like the propensity of undergrads to get drunk, take off their masks, and lick each others' eyeballs - to a quantitative probability, using the highly precise, scientific technique of &lt;em&gt;taking a wild-ass guess.&lt;/em&gt; That guess was wrong. The campus reopening was a super-spreader event.
Any model runs the risk of hiding the irreducible complexity of qualitative factors behind a formula, turning uncertainty into certainty and humility into arrogance.
Think of how we replaced contact tracing with exposure notification. Contact tracing has a qualitative foundation: public health workers establish rapport with infected people, win their trust, and get them to fully enumerate the places they've been and the activities they participated in.
By contrast, exposure notification measures whether two Bluetooth radios were within range of each other for a predetermined interval. It substitutes signal strength for a person's own understanding of their experience. Now, people can be wrong about their own experience - we lose track of time, we misremember emotionally charged events, and so on - but that doesn't mean we can &lt;em&gt;substitute&lt;/em&gt; Bluetooth measurements for personal experience.
That's why, despite all the clever privacy-preserving math and interesting analysis, exposure notification was a bust, something between a distraction and a false-confidence-generating disaster. Contact tracing ended the 2014 ebola outbreak. Exposure notification just wasted a lot of time:
&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/05/cory-doctorow-qualia/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2021/05/cory-doctorow-qualia/&lt;/a&gt;
It's just too easy to forget which parts of a model are based on guesses and which parts are based on ground truth. And even if you can keep track of those differences, it's even harder to re-check the model's ground truth to determine whether the underlying factors have changed. That's how we got into so much trouble with collateralized debt obligations, which were supposed to be "risk-free" mortgage derivatives that could be safely insured and invested in.
The formulas behind CDO hedging were designed by some of the world's smartest mathematicians and physicists, who simply assumed that market actors - from loan-originating bank officers to insurance underwriters - would act in reliable, predictable ways. They were so very wrong that they brought the world economy to the brink of ruin:
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wp-quant/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wp-quant/&lt;/a&gt;
This is also science fiction's failure-mode: any science fictional "ask-the-next-question" exercise represents a series of &lt;em&gt;guesses&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;speculations&lt;/em&gt; or maybe &lt;em&gt;possibilities&lt;/em&gt; - but when you combine that guesswork with the deceptive certainty that comes from inhabiting a cracking &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;, it's easy to mistake "guessing" for "prediction."
Prediction is hard, especially about the future. The assumptions that go into a prediction are always incomplete, not least because human beings have free will and agency and can change the circumstances that go into the assumptions. The very best science fiction embodies this principle. I'm thinking here of the likes of Ada Palmer, an historian &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; sf writer whose deep historical knowledge informs her sf and her pedagogy at the University of Chicago:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/10/monopoly-begets-monopoly/#terra-ignota"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/10/monopoly-begets-monopoly/#terra-ignota&lt;/a&gt;
Palmer is famous - even notorious - for her annual four-week undergraduate LARP in which students re-enact the election of the Medicis' Pope. It's four weeks of alliances, betrayal and skullduggery by the students, each of whom is enacting the agenda of a real-world Cardinal or other power-broker.
The final investiture is done in full costume at the university's massive faux-gothic cathedral, and going into that climax, of the four candidates, two are always the same, because the great forces of history are bearing down on that moment to ensure that the champions of the two dominant power-blocs are in the running. But the other two? They're &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; the same - because the agency of the actors jockeying for power change the outcome, every single time, in absolutely unpredictable ways.
Like any other model, sf is wrong, but sometimes useful. Thinking about jetpacks and flying cars is "useful" insofar as it gets us to interrogate how we think about cities, about mobility, about privilege and geography. But it's not a &lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt;. Worse, the endless tales in which flying cars are presented as &lt;em&gt;faits accompli&lt;/em&gt; is a gift to grifters raising money for the objectively stupid idea of flying cars. After all, we all know flying cars are inevitable, so it's basically a risk-free investment, right? With flying cars just around the corner, wouldn't it be irresponsible to build a city with mass-transit instead of helipads?
There's a whole range of thought-experiments that got transformed into predictions and then certainties: self-driving cars, "general artificial intelligence," infinite life-extension, space colonization, faster-than-light travel, cryptocurrency, etc etc.
Spreadsheets don't just lead their &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; astray - they also trick their &lt;em&gt;creators&lt;/em&gt;. The very same people who transform wild-assed guesses about hairy, unknowable outcomes into neat mathematical relationships are perfectly capable of acting as if those relationships are based on fact, rather than supposition. The Great Financial Crisis wasn't just about people who didn't understand the uncertainty in the hedging algorithm going all-in - the people who &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; those models were &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; fooled by them.
It's very easy to get high on your own supply. I'll never forget the sf convention panel I was on with Robert Silverberg about sf's supposed predictive value, where the subject of Robert A Heinlein came up, and Silverberg sniffed, and, in that trademark bone-dry way of his, said, "Ah yes, 'Robert A Timeline.'"
Sf isn't just full of writers who mistake their suppositions for predictions - the canon is full of tales in which brilliant people &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; predict the future, with near-perfection. Think of Hari Seldon, the hero of Asimov's Foundation series, who is able to forecast the future several &lt;em&gt;millennia&lt;/em&gt; out. Or Heinlein's first-ever story, "Life-Line," in which a genius inventor destroys the insurance industry by creating a computer that can predict your exact date of death using statistical methods.
There's something wild about this phenomenon, in which writers make stuff up and then assume that anything that &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt; must also be &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt;. One tantalizing explanation for this comes from EL Doctorow's (no relation) essay "Genesis," from his 2007 collection "The Creationists":
&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/41520/creationists-by-e-l-doctorow/"&gt;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/41520/creationists-by-e-l-doctorow/&lt;/a&gt;
Doctorow tells the history of the Genesis story, which the Hebrews plagiarized from the Babylonians. In Doctorow's telling, the Babylonian mystics who made up the Genesis story assumed that it had to be true, because they considered themselves to be nowhere near imaginative enough to have come up with something as great as Genesis. An idea that amazing &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be divinely inspired.
I like this because it's a story of being led astray by humility, rather than hubris.
Imaginative exercises - whether or not they are assisted by mathematical models and self-updating digital spreadsheets - are powerful tools for thinking about the future we want, and to guide our attempts to make that future come true. All models are wrong but some models are useful, of course!

&lt;h1&gt;Canadian judge invalidates Safe Third Country Agreement (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#kids-kages-kanada"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Remember during the Muslim Ban, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted those heart-warming words of support for refugees brutalized by American border-thugs....
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justintrudeau/status/825438460265762816"&gt;https://twitter.com/justintrudeau/status/825438460265762816&lt;/a&gt;
And then failed to do a single fucking thing to help those people?
I mean, yeah, JT has never met a progressive policy he wasn't willing to endorse provided he didn't have to expend a single nanogram of political capital in its service.
But where the Prince of Canada would not go, Canada's Federal court has. Today, A Federal Canadian Court invalidated the 16-year-old US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, so asylum seekers denied entry to the US can try again in Canada.

The court found that - as was obvious to every non-sociopath in either country - the fact that the US illegally imprisons asylum-seekers means that the US is not "safe" for asylum seekers.
I mean, in case there was any doubt, the US is also run by a violent, brooding narcissist with chronic logorrhea who routinely declares that it is not a safe country for asylum seekers (bit of a fucking giveaway, that).
58,000 people have crossed from the US into Canada, seeking asylum, only to be turned away because good ole JT couldn't be arsed to turn his high-flown sentiments into law (I mean, if only he knew someone who could affect Canadian policy!).
"It is my conclusion, based upon the evidence, that ineligible STCA claimants are returned to the US by Canadian officials where they are immediately and automatically imprisoned by US authorities.
"I have concluded that imprisonment and the attendant consequences are inconsistent with the spirit and objective of the STCA and are a violation of the rights guaranteed by section 7 of the [Charter of Rights and Freedoms]" -Federal court judge Ann Marie McDonald

&lt;h1&gt;Supreme Court poised to destroy machine learning security research (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#van-buren"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
US lawmaking has a distinctive failure mode: because of the Constitution's absolute language and extensive jurisprudence, lawmakers can please their base by enacting bad, overreaching or stupid laws and then hope the courts will narrow or overturn them before they detonate.
This moral hazard is not evenly distributed: if you are the party that decries "activist judges" and campaigns on the idea that governments are bad at everything, then enacting bad laws and then having them overturned serves your cause especially well.
On a totally different subject, let's talk about Ronald Reagan. After Reagan saw Matthew Broderick's classic technothriller WAR GAMES, he became convinced that America needed a far-reaching cybercrime bill, something Fed prosecutors had been demanding for years.
That's how the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) came into being: it's a maddeningly badly drafted, overreaching, vague law that potentially felonizes any act that "exceeds your authorization" on someone else's computer system.
Private firms have taken the extreme position that since their terms of service define your "authorization" on their computers, that any violation of the terms of service is a jailable felony.
In practical terms, that means that if you violate a company's terms of service - a sprawling garbage-novella of deliberately impenetrable legalese - they can send you to prison, for a very long time. This is really bad.
Most of the time, of course, Fed prosecutors don't like to charge people criminally for violating ToS, but when they have someone they want to punish for petty reasons they can find a ToS violation and charge them criminally.
That's the Aaron Swartz story: Aaron violated MIT and JSTOR's terms of service, and a prosecutor that Aaron had previously humiliated by beating a bullshit charge was able to re-charge Aaron with 13 felonies and threaten him with 35 years in prison.
(Background: Aaron published a trove of paywalled, public domain court records from PACER, the feds' legal repository. He embarrassed the legal system by showing that these court records that anyone could get at $0.10/page were improperly redacted and exposed crime victims)
(Aaron later scraped a bunch of scientific journal articles he was allowed to access via MIT's network; but the system's ToS said he had to access them manually, not via a small script that downloaded them automatically - this was the felony)
(After using legal maneuvers to draw out the case until Aaron and everyone he could tap was broke, the PACER prosecutors were steaming towards a prison sentence for Aaron; he hanged himself rather than face incarceration)
Over the years the CFAA has had many court cases, and these have produced a "circuit split," with some US courts interpreting CFAA narrowly, and others taking a dangerous, expansive view of its text.
Ever heard the phrase "hard cases make bad law?" The thing about overreaching, vague laws like CFAA is that they can be shaped to criminalize ANY conduct, so if there's someone who did something objectively terrible, vague laws give prosecutors an easy path to "justice."
Nathan Van Buren is an accused dirty cop who sold access to license plate databases to his confederates. Prosecutors decided to charge him under the CFAA, which could indeed mete out severe punishments for this kind of bad behavior.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/van-buren-v-united-states"&gt;https://www.eff.org/cases/van-buren-v-united-states&lt;/a&gt;
But that punishment comes at a high price: a precedent that could be wielded against ANYONE who violated Terms of Service, something that all of us do, a hundred times a day, without noticing it. It would give prosecutors leeway to do what they did to Aaron, over and over.
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear Van Buren, and, as is customary in this kind of high-stakes hearing, different groups are racing to file amicus ("friend of the court") briefs explaining the knock-on effects of a bad ruling.
In support a briefs, a group of legal, security, AI, and human rights scholars published "Legal Risks of Adversarial Machine Learning Research," exploring the potential impact of Van Buren on the critical work of analyzing machine learning models.
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16179.pdf"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16179.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Adversarial Machine Learning is the vital process of systematically testing machine learning models to reveal security defects, bias, and other problems. It is high-stakes work: without AML, you can trick car autopilots into steering into oncoming traffic!
AML is also key to revealing racial bias in risk analysis software, facial recognition, predictive policing, hiring algorithms, and a host of other areas in which peoples' freedom, prosperity, safety and very lives are at stake.
The authors explain in admirably plain language how a bad decision in Van Buren puts this enterprise at risk - how it could leave us (literally) flying blind, forced to rely on self-serving assurances of vendors when we trust their systems with every aspect of our world.
This is the worst possible outcome of the moral hazard in American lawmaking: not merely that lawmakers will promulgate bad laws to feed their base in the hopes that courts will strike them down and give them fresh grievances to campaign on.
But rather that these laws will become institutionalized, that they will give rise to questions so technical and nuanced that they slide through the courts and end up enshrined in our justice system.
Depending on the outcome of Van Buren, the CFAA could become an enduring tool for thin-skinned corporate execs and petty, vengeful prosecutors to imprison anyone that displeases them - including the security researchers we rely on to vet our increasingly automated world.

&lt;h1&gt;Where Will Everyone Go (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#migration-models"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The looming climate emergency will actually be a mesh of mutually accelerating emergencies: droughts, fires and famines; pandemics; mass extinctions; floods and erosion; and all of this will drive waves of refugee crises.
"Where Will Everyone Go?" is the most ambitious attempt yet to model the migration patterns of the climate emergencies.  Baruch College geographer Bryan Jones was commissioned by Pro Public and the New York Times to model 5 scenarios.
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/2020-climate-migration-part-1-methodology#978948"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/2020-climate-migration-part-1-methodology#978948&lt;/a&gt;
I. Optimistic: "climate impacts are rapidly reduced on a global scale, there is regional convergence toward higher levels of development"
II. Pessimistic: "climate change impacts are on the high end of current plausible scenarios with significant challenges to development"
III. Climate-friendly: Progress on climate mitigation, no progress on development
IV. Development-friendly: Little action on climate, lots of progress on development
V. Moderate: some of each
The scenarios were run on a supercomputing cluster over a course of days, using sophisticated models with billions of inputs:
&lt;a href="https://assets-c3.propublica.org/Climate-Migration-Modeling-Methodology.pdf"&gt;https://assets-c3.propublica.org/Climate-Migration-Modeling-Methodology.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
The outcomes were then turned into a series of vital narratives that tell the real stories of Mexican and Central American climate refugees, and use these to explore the five scenarios.
&lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/climate-migration/model-how-climate-refugees-move-across-continents/#980800"&gt;https://features.propublica.org/climate-migration/model-how-climate-refugees-move-across-continents/#980800&lt;/a&gt;
The takeaways are both brutal and energizing. There's no question that we are facing mass-scale displacement as farmland becomes unproductive, and, in some cases, uninhabitable - literally lethal in a matter of hours to unprotected humans.
But how much of this displacement takes place is entirely in our hands. There's huge variation between the degradation in the scenarios based on how seriously we take climate mitigation.
Likewise, the human cost of displacement is in our hands: as displacement drives mass urbanization, we can abandon migrants to crime and deprivation, or create thriving prosperous cities, resilient to climate-based emergencies: floods, pandemics, fires, extreme weather.
The model does what a model should: shows us the costs and benefits of different approaches. The costs of inaction are brutal, an existential challenge to our civilization and species.
The benefits? We live and thrive.
The choice is ours.

&lt;h1&gt;BLM footage censored by copyright bots (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#dolphins-in-tuna-nets"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Exactly one year ago today, people started toying with the idea of suppressing the spread of Nazi rallies by playing copyrighted music in the background, so that Big Tech's copyright filters would automatically censor them.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/earthboy__/status/1152959161455566857"&gt;https://twitter.com/earthboy__/status/1152959161455566857&lt;/a&gt;
At the time, I predicted that this would end badly: that the copyright filters would become a major barrier to the spread of progressive messages and even become a way to suppress footage of police violence and other human rights abuses.
&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/23/double-edged-swords-r-us.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2019/07/23/double-edged-swords-r-us.html&lt;/a&gt;
Boy was I right.
The Lumen Database of copyright takedowns rounds up the many ways in which footage of Black Lives Matter demonstrations has been censored, downranked and demonetized thanks to copyright complaints.
&lt;a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/background-audio-takedowns"&gt;https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/background-audio-takedowns&lt;/a&gt;
Because if your rally includes someone playing  Marvin Gaye's "Let’s Get it On," 2Pac's "Keep Ya Head Up," Beyonce's "Freedom," Kanye's "Power" or Kendrick Lamar's "Alright" it is prone to disappearing from the net.
These are accidental takedowns, dolphins in the tuna net - but you can use this tactic to go dolphin fishing, too: "These removals are all accidental, in the sense that they are false positives, there is the possibility of deliberately leveraging these flaws in the system."

&lt;h1&gt;Living through Xinjiang's genocide (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/03/never-again/#never-again"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
It's disturbingly easy to forget that China is operating a genocidal program of ethnic cleansing against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang province. The secrecy of the concentration camps and the chaos of the world makes it all rather abstract.
But periodically, a leak or a first-hand account will bring the issue back to the fore, and each time that happens, it's a chance to galvanize action. We've missed a lot of these chances.
In 2017, the Chinese state announced that it would collect the DNA of every person in the province.
&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171214/07293538807/china-is-building-ultimate-surveillance-tool-dna-database-every-adult-resident-troubled-xinjiang-region.shtml"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171214/07293538807/china-is-building-ultimate-surveillance-tool-dna-database-every-adult-resident-troubled-xinjiang-region.shtml&lt;/a&gt;
Later that year, we learned that cops were using ubiquitous stop-and-frisks to force Uyghurs to install surveillance apps on their phones:
&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/china-forces-muslim-minority-to-install-spyware-on-their-phones/"&gt;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/china-forces-muslim-minority-to-install-spyware-on-their-phones/&lt;/a&gt;
In 2018, a redditor visiting Xinjiang was forced to install the surveillance app at the border:
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/8ofiiw/chinese_border_police_installed_software_on_my/e03ae1a/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/8ofiiw/chinese_border_police_installed_software_on_my/e03ae1a/&lt;/a&gt;
It wasn't a one-off - soon, every tourist was having the app installed during border inspections:
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/02/chinese-border-guards-surveillance-app-tourists-phones"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/02/chinese-border-guards-surveillance-app-tourists-phones&lt;/a&gt;
When Human Rights Watch reverse-engineered the app, they revealed just how far-reaching and sinister it was - a system for algorithmic surveillance, suspicion and accusation:
&lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2019/05/02/china-how-mass-surveillance-works-xinjiang"&gt;https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2019/05/02/china-how-mass-surveillance-works-xinjiang&lt;/a&gt;
But as chilling as these dry technological accounts were, they were still technical, not personal. It was only when they were augmented by leaks about the plans for ethnic cleansing and survivor accounts from the camps that the true horror set in.
The pic of hundreds of prisoners kneeling in ranks on a train platform, shaven heads bowed:
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nrg8000/status/1175353408749891584"&gt;https://twitter.com/Nrg8000/status/1175353408749891584&lt;/a&gt;
And then the leaked Chinese intelligence memos detailing the plan to open 500 concentration camps disguised as "training centers."
&lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/read-the-china-cables-documents/"&gt;https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/read-the-china-cables-documents/&lt;/a&gt;
The camp survivor who told of punitive rape, forced labor, torture and medical experimentation:
&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighur-muslim-detention-camps-xi-jinping-persecution-a9165896.html"&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighur-muslim-detention-camps-xi-jinping-persecution-a9165896.html&lt;/a&gt;
And the hundreds of pages of leaked state docs revealing that the cruelty was part of the plan, the "no mercy" plan inspired by America's decades-long domestic "war on terror."
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html&lt;/a&gt;
Gradually, the connection between the camps, the apps, and everyday life came into focus. The camps were everting, thanks to the apps, turning Xinjiang's cities into "smart cities" that operated as satellites of the camps:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-china-surveillance-prison.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-china-surveillance-prison.html&lt;/a&gt;
And every month, fresh reminders that Xinjiang is part of the "supply chain": that our electronics, covid supplies, and  gewgaws are being made by terrorized slaves as part of a wider plan to erase a people:
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/xinjiang-us-to-block-chinese-forced-labour-products-as-eu-warns-on-trade"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/xinjiang-us-to-block-chinese-forced-labour-products-as-eu-warns-on-trade&lt;/a&gt;
We've squandered so many opportunities to treat the situation in Xinjiang with the alarm it deserves, and yet they keep coming, bought with the blood of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims.
Today, the Intercepted podcast reports on another set of leaks, these describing the terror of everyday life outside of the camps - cities overshadowed by surveillance and the looming threat of being taken away.
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/03/intercepted-china-uyghur-muslim-surveillance-police/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2021/02/03/intercepted-china-uyghur-muslim-surveillance-police/&lt;/a&gt;
Parents separated from their children, families forced to install cameras inside their homes, forced sterilizations and abortions, desecration of cemeteries, torture and sexual violence.
It's haunting, deeply disturbing reportage, but we can't afford to look away.

&lt;h1&gt;EFF offering legal referrals to protesters (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/05/afrofuturism/#lawyerup"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
EFF has a "cooperating attorneys" list of hundreds of cyberlawyers who care about keeping good people safe from legal harms.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/eff-offering-assistance-attorney-referrals-protesters"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/eff-offering-assistance-attorney-referrals-protesters&lt;/a&gt;
The organization is opening that list to "people facing legal troubles as a result of their participation in the ongoing demonstrations, especially those involving surveillance or devices such as phones."
"Protesters and reporters in need of legal assistance should reach out to us at info@eff.org. We treat requests that come in to us as confidential, and always protect the identities and information of those that come to us for legal assistance."

&lt;h1&gt;The unsatisfying history of obscenity (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/05/afrofuturism/#popehat"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I have exactly one complaint about "Make No Law," Ken White's superb podcast that explains the evolution of First Amendment law by dramatizing and explaining pivotal Supreme Court cases: it doesn't come out often enough.
On the other hand, absence makes the heart grow fungus, and so my heart mushroomed with joy when I saw a new episode in my podcatcher this morning: "I Know It When I See It," on the evolution of American obscenity laws.
&lt;a href="https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/make-no-law/2020/06/i-know-it-when-i-see-it/"&gt;https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/make-no-law/2020/06/i-know-it-when-i-see-it/&lt;/a&gt;
The episode features a deep dive into Jacobellis v. Ohio, the case that birthed the infamous and unsatisfying cop-out standard for what is, and is not obscenity: "I know it when I see it."
Critical First Amendment cases are always fascinating because they deal with contentious expression, often artistic expression, and Jacobellis is no exception.
It concerned a theater's exhibition of Les Amants, a 1958 French film about an affair. What outraged the state of Ohio? A woman has an affair without being condemned for it, and has a pleasurable experience when her lover performs oral sex on her.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lovers_(1958_film)"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lovers_(1958_film)&lt;/a&gt;
White's delightful dive into the evolution of US obscenity rules takes detours through film criticism and American puritanism, and delivers a gripping seminar on the fine points of the law on the way.

&lt;h1&gt;A ride through of Elitch Gardens' Kaleidoscope (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/05/afrofuturism/#whee"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
For &lt;em&gt;centuries&lt;/em&gt;, Denverites have enjoyed the pleasures of their Elitch Gardens, a pleasure park that opened 30 years after the founding of Denver and has since evolved into a wonderful theme park.
&lt;a href="https://www.elitchgardens.com/plan-a-visit/park-history/"&gt;https://www.elitchgardens.com/plan-a-visit/park-history/&lt;/a&gt;
One of the park's marquee attraction is "Kaleidoscope," created by Santa Fe's Meow Wolf, the justifiably famous and beloved immersive experience designers backed by George RR Martin.
Kaleidoscope is pure atmosphere, mixing cutting-edge projection-mapping with traditional mechanical effects to create a surreal, psychedelic experience - like if Disneyland's Alice ride was remade by Tim Burton.
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEeQnVPxRb4"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEeQnVPxRb4&lt;/a&gt;
The video ridethough is pure bonkers pleasure. I don't know when I'll be able to fly again, but I am still technically the Guest of Honor for Denver's Milehicon, next October, and if it happens, I'm definitely sneaking off for a ride!
&lt;a href="https://www.milehicon.org/"&gt;https://www.milehicon.org/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/interoperable-3.png"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Big Tech is good at being big (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/05/afrofuturism/#at-scale"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
When I talk about how we should fight tech monopolies, I often make the point that tech companies used to grow by making things, but now they grow by buying them.
For example Google created 1.5 amazing products (a search engine and a Hotmail clone) and then bought a bunch of companies. Its in-house products - G+, Sidewalk Labs, smartwatches, Loon - are boondoggles, vanity projects and failures.
A couple weeks ago, a Twitter commenter challenged me on this, asking why Google's excellence when it comes to SCALE didn't qualify as "innovation"? In some ways, making a hit product is the easy part - keeping it running once it's a hit is the hard part.
I have a lot of sympathy for this argument. I'm a recovering systems administrator. I know how hard scale is. I remember when Youtube was all "buffering..." errors. Hell, I remember when Blogger crashed on a near-daily basis.
Google's expertise in running reliable services at scale is humbling and astounding.
But it's not enough. The argument is complex, so I wrote an essay about it:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/technical-excellence-and-scale"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/technical-excellence-and-scale&lt;/a&gt;
The short version: doing things well at scale comes with the territory for monopolists. Standard Oil pumped a lot of oil and the Rail Trust moved a lot of rolling stock. If being good at scale gets you a pass from anti-monopoly law, then anti-monopoly law is meaningless.
What's more, much of Google's expertise at scaling (as well as that of other Big Tech, from Apple and Microsoft to Facebook) is the result of still more acquisitions - from server companies to cluster-management companies.
In a world of vigorously enforced anti-monopoly rules, those companies would be standalones, selling products to anyone who wanted them - not allowing monopolists to better manage the nascent competitors they've gobbled up.

&lt;h1&gt;Personalized, signed copies of Little Brother/Homeland (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/05/afrofuturism/#snowden"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
During this month's uprisings, I've heard from hundreds of people who wrote to tell me that they're reminded of my novels Little Brother and Homeland, books in which youth-led uprising meet overwhelming, militarized force and high-tech surveillance.
Often, people praise me for some kind of prescience in writing these books; but as with so much science fiction, what looks like prediction is actually observation. Cops have been ratcheting up surveillance and militarization for longer than I've been writing.
I find this trend every bit as alarming as you do. The closer I observe it, the more worried I become, especially as the private sector becomes more and more central to the totalitarian project .
At that point, you're not just fighting systemic racism and paranoia in law enforcement. Private sector procurements turn that into a chimera where gladhanding commissioned salesfores offer junkets, massages, cash and gear to cops who buy spy tech.
They recruit sports stars as spokespeople (and offer them shares in the company):
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/eff-challenges-ring-spokesperson-shaq-over-privacy-concerns"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/eff-challenges-ring-spokesperson-shaq-over-privacy-concerns&lt;/a&gt;
Their billionaire owners threaten reporters who disclose their role in helping governments violate human rights and use attack lawyers to secure misleading "retractions."
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/14/yana-peel-uk-rights-advocate-serpentine-nso-spyware-pegasus"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/14/yana-peel-uk-rights-advocate-serpentine-nso-spyware-pegasus&lt;/a&gt;
Periodically this boils over and I write a new Little Brother. The next one, Attack Surface, is about a spy-tech hacker who realizes she's been on the wrong side of things when her friend's Oakland BLM chapter is targeted by the tools she developed.
&lt;a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/"&gt;https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/&lt;/a&gt;
In anticipation of that release, on Jul 7, Tor Books is publishing an omnibus edition of Little Brother and Homeland, which Snowden - who knows firsthand what it means to switch from spying on people to defending them from spying - wrote an amazing intro for.
My local sf/horror/fantasy bookstore, Dark Delicacies, is offering signed, personalized copies of the book, which you can preorder here:

They're hanging in there, despite having been kicked out of their home of 25 years by a greedy landlord (who still hasn't managed to rent their old space, and may he lose his shirt), and despite the pandemic. I'm so pleased to be able to find a way to support them.
Dark Delicacies is also offering personalized, signed copies of my first picture book, Poesy the Monster Slayer, which comes out the following week:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/04/cross-burnings/#pw"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/04/cross-burnings/#pw&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;No fix for Chrome's Incognito Mode (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/05/afrofuturism/#we-see-you"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
When you hit a newspaper's "soft paywall" and try to load the article in Chrome's Incognito Mode (which promises to undetectably present your browser to the site as a new user, with no cookies), the site often complains that you're in private mode and balks.
How is this possible? What happened to "undetectable?" Google updated Chrome in 2019, promising to make it impossible for sites to distinguish between incognito mode and new users.
&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/incognito-mode-detection-still-works-in-chrome-despite-promise-to-fix/"&gt;https://www.zdnet.com/article/incognito-mode-detection-still-works-in-chrome-despite-promise-to-fix/&lt;/a&gt;
The way sites had previously made this distinction was by checking to see whether they could write data to your browser's local storage; Incognito Mode did not allow this. Chrome "fixed" this by capping Incognito's local storage at 120MB.
So, of course, anti-Incognito scripts immediately appeared: all they had to do was check to see whether available storage was precisely 120MB. Sites like the New York Times rolled out this script right away.
A year's gone by and Google still hasn't fixed it. Google's caught between different priorities here: on the one hand, it's been named in a class action suit for tracking users in Incognito Mode.
On the other hand, news companies have pursued both litigation and lawmaking (especially in the EU) against Google, and the company is unwilling to pick a fight with companies that buy their ink by the barrel.
Caught in the crossfire are users, who want Incognito Mode to block their identities from a wide range of spying activities, including protesters looking to protect their identities from police surveillance.

&lt;h1&gt;DoJ seizes pro-BLM coronavirus masks (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/05/afrofuturism/#i-cant-breathe"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Movement for Black Lives had tens of thousands of dollars' worth of coronavirus masks printed for protesters to wear, but these keep getting seized by cops in the mail.
&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-coronavirus-protest-masks_n_5ed9a69bc5b68bc1a40159b9"&gt;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-coronavirus-protest-masks_n_5ed9a69bc5b68bc1a40159b9&lt;/a&gt;
Four shipments - from Oakland to NYC, DC, Minneapolis and St Louis - were seized, and M4BL has been instructed to "contact the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for further information."
The masks were produced by Movement Ink's Rene Quinonez, who said, "This isn't a weapon. It's more about safety. We’re trying to figure out how to keep our community safe."
The CDC - which, under Trump's direction, has put in one of the worst public health responses on the planet - advises protesters to wear masks and has warned that protests could be "seeding events" for covid outbreaks.
Here's a statement from The Movement for Black Lives's Chelsea Fuller: "Police have rioted coast to coast, beating and gassing protesters who have called for an end to police violence, with the explicit approval of President Trump.
"Now, it appears they want to ensure that people who protest are susceptible to the same deadly pandemic that they have failed miserably at stopping. The continued surveillance and disruption of social movements under this administration is as chilling as it is dangerous. It should be roundly condemned."
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/sfwa-logo-2020.png"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Science Fiction Writers of America on Black Lives Matter (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/05/afrofuturism/#sfwa"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America has published an excellent statement on Black Lives Matter and the protests.
&lt;a href="https://www.sfwa.org/2020/06/04/a-statement-from-sfwa-on-black-lives-matter-and-protests/"&gt;https://www.sfwa.org/2020/06/04/a-statement-from-sfwa-on-black-lives-matter-and-protests/&lt;/a&gt;
In it, they acknowledge that "SFWA has historically ignored and, in too many instances, reinforced the injustices, systemic barriers, and unaddressed racism, particularly toward Black people, that have contributed to this moment."
Science fiction has had a large reactionary element literally from the start, when leftist science fiction writers from the Futurian house were excluded from the very first World Science Fiction Convention because of their political views.
&lt;a href="http://www.jophan.org/mimosa/m21/kyle.htm"&gt;http://www.jophan.org/mimosa/m21/kyle.htm&lt;/a&gt;
SFWA's forums and message boards were slow off the mark to address racist and sexist harassment, and white supremacist elements in the field have tried to sabotage the Hugo Awards, picketed conventions, and sent racist messages over SFWA's channels.
But SFWA underwent a sea change some years ago and has been making meaningful strides towards inclusion ever since. In the new statement - unanimously signed by SFWA's board - the organization acknowledges that these measures are not enough.
They announce a raft of new, concrete steps they will take to improve the inclusivity and diversity of the field, including:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donating proceeds from June Nebula Conference ticket purchases to the Carl Brandon Society and the Black Speculative Fiction Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matching every Nebula ticket bought in June with a seat for a Black writer at the event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiving fees for Black writers at next year's Nebula event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering travel subsidies to Black writers attending next year's Nebulas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiving SFWA membership dues for Black writers for the next year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering grant money to Black-led sf/f organizations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization also links to several reading lists, notably Ibram X Kendi's "Antiracist Reading List":
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/books/review/antiracist-reading-list-ibram-x-kendi.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/books/review/antiracist-reading-list-ibram-x-kendi.html&lt;/a&gt;
And they provide links to several Black sf/f and literary organizations:

&lt;h1&gt;At the FTC, a quiet, profound shift on antitrust (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/09/rest-in-piss-robert-bork/#harmful-dominance"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Sometimes, a tiny change in the political process comes along that makes you realize just how far things have come - a change that's both substantive &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; symbolic. Something like this terse, six-paragraph memo from the FTC, a deceptively anodyne wrapper for an explosive moment:
&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events/2022/05/ftc-justice-department-listening-forum-firsthand-effects-mergers-acquisitions-technology"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events/2022/05/ftc-justice-department-listening-forum-firsthand-effects-mergers-acquisitions-technology&lt;/a&gt;
Here's the crux: "The FTC and DOJ will host a series of listening forums to hear from those who have experienced firsthand the effects of mergers and acquisitions beyond antitrust experts, including consumers, workers, entrepreneurs, start-ups, farmers, investors, and independent businesses."
If you aren't chest-deep in weird antitrust lore, this probably seems like it's par for the course. But believe me, this is a hell of a moment - a moment of restoration, a return to a vital, long-dormant principle in American governance: the idea that corporations should not be allowed to ruin the lives of the people around them.
This was the idea behind antitrust in the first place. As Senator John Sherman said to Congress as he labored to pass his landmark antitrust law in 1890: "If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life."
&lt;a href="https://marker.medium.com/we-should-not-endure-a-king-dfef34628153"&gt;https://marker.medium.com/we-should-not-endure-a-king-dfef34628153&lt;/a&gt;
"If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade."
This was the foundation of American antitrust: the idea that companies of a certain scale would, by dint of that size, be in a position to exercise the autocratic control of a monarch, and return America to a tyrannical monarchy cloaked in the pretense of industry.
For nearly a century, this was the bedrock of antitrust enforcement, the idea of "harmful dominance" - that companies could attain a scale that made them a danger to the very idea of democratic control and legitimacy.
Rich people seethed and chafed and schemed to overturn this. They &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to rule as if they were kings, wanted to avoid the scourge of what Peter Thiel calls "wasteful competition" ("competition is for losers" - P. Thiel). They bankrolled and promoted a deranged conspiracist named Robert Bork - Nixon's solicitor general - who advanced a truly bizarre theory of antitrust.
Bork was a conspiracist, whose book "The Antitrust Paradox" maintained the historically unsupportable nonsense that what Sherman, Clayton and the other legislators behind America's antitrust laws &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted was to block "harmful monopolies" and leave the "efficient monopolies" to grow and rule, as benign kings:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down&lt;/a&gt;
Now, this is untrue. It's not just untrue, it is unhinged. No reading of either the laws in question or the debates preceding their passage supports this idea. It is a fantasy, alternate history. A lie. But it was a convenient lie, because if it &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; true, then all the rich people promoting Bork's fringe theory could create monopolies and rule as kings.
Ronald Reagan bought it. After a failed bid to put Bork on the Supreme Court - he failed his confirmation hearing so spectacularly that anyone who self-immolates in DC is said to be "borked" - Reagan adopted his antitrust theories. They spread around the world thanks to other monsters of the era, Thatcher, Mulroney, Kohl, Pinochet.
The idea infected the judiciary: the cushy Manne seminars, held every summer at a luxury resort, flew in 40% of the Federal bench for indoctrination seminars on Bork's theories. These judges learned that the only people who should be consulted on antitrust matters are economists, specifically the kind of economist who trades in the kinds of highly abstract, inscrutable mathematical models that Bork and his University of Chicago colleagues specialized in.
Whenever a merger was in question, the companies could pay a Chicago economist to build a model that proved that the merger was "efficient" and thus good for "consumer welfare." If that merger resulted in prices skyrocketing - the one thing "consumer welfare" was supposed to concern itself with - those same economists could be paid to produce a new model to prove that the price increase wasn't the result of a monopoly - it was due to oil prices, or labor prices, or the phase of the moon.
Pre-Bork, everyone who was harmed by a monopoly had standing to seek redress from a regulator. If monopolies resulted in pollution, or unsafe working conditions, or corruption, or the annihilation of a city's character or a town's way of life, the people affected could tell their stories to a regulator and expect that their experiences would be factors in the calculus as to whether to prosecute the monopoly.
But after Bork, the only people whose input mattered was Chicago-style economists whose mathematical models couldn't be interrogated by laypeople. They became court sorcerers to the competition regulators, and when petitioners came before the regulator, they would slaughter a goat, read its steaming guts, and pronounce that "consumer welfare" was doing fine. If the petitioner had the temerity to say that they read something different in the offal, the sorcerer could smirk and dismiss them: "Look who thinks he can read the economy in the guts of a goat? He didn't even get an economics degree from the University of Chicago!"
For 40 years, antitrust has been a coma, sleeping while monopolies formed in every sector, destroying our planet, our regulatory integrity, our national prosperity, our public safety and the confidence of people in their democracies.
But as Stein's Law has it, "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop." Something has to give. A new crop of "neo-Brandeisians" - lawyers, economists, activists, workers - has sprouted, insisting that Bork's ideas have failed us and that they need to be set aside.
One of the most prominent of these is Lina Khan. Today, Khan is the chair of the FTC. Five years ago, she was a third year law student (!), whose landmark law review article, "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," was a scorching indictment of Bork that tore through legal circles and upended orthodoxy:
&lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox&lt;/a&gt;
Khan hasn't been shy about her plans to restore American antitrust to its roots as a doctrine of economic liberty, in which workers and small business-people do not have the course of their lives determined by Sherman's "autocrats of trade."
She and the other top Biden antitrust enforcers - Tim Wu in the White House, Jonathan Kanter at the DoJ - worked to produce the Biden executive order on antitrust, a genuine landmark document specifying dozens of specific actions that the admin would take to blunt corporate power. Less than a year on, they've hit every milestone in that document.
&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/&lt;/a&gt;
In January, the FTC and DoJ announced that they would be reviewing the agencies' merger guidelines - again, something that sounds like business as usual to a layperson but really marks an enormous shift in American politics. The new guidelines will make it &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder for big companies to grow by merging with each other or gobbling up little businesses before they can become competitors.
&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/01/federal-trade-commission-justice-department-seek-strengthen-enforcement-against-illegal-mergers"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/01/federal-trade-commission-justice-department-seek-strengthen-enforcement-against-illegal-mergers&lt;/a&gt;
And now there's this week's hearings, in which the FTC and DoJ will hear from "who have experienced firsthand the effects of mergers and acquisitions beyond antitrust experts, including consumers, workers, entrepreneurs, start-ups, farmers, investors, and independent businesses."
With the exception of "consumers," these are the people who, for 40 years, have been laughed out of the room by antitrust enforcers. The people who have been told that they have nothing to say when it comes to the way that giant corporations undermine our quality of life, freedom of action, and economic chances.
This may sound like normal activity for a competition regulator (because it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be normal), but this is extraordinary. For the first time in a generation and a half - in &lt;em&gt;ten presidential administrations&lt;/em&gt; - everyday people will get a say on whether corporate power should be blunted.
This is huge.

&lt;h1&gt;Substituting economics for politics is a failure (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/27/economism/#what-would-i-do-if-i-were-a-horse"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Most of us believe that we do stuff because we want to be good people, and that other people act the same. But the dominant political philosophy for the last half-century, "economism," views us as slaves to "incentives" and nothing more.
Economism is the philosophy of the neoclassical economists, whose ideology has consumed both the Democrats and Republicans. They dismiss all "non-market" solutions (that is, projects of democratically accountable governments) as failed before they're begun, due to the "incentives" of the individuals in the government.
Economism's major project has been to dismantle the achievements of the New Deal (Social Security, unions, public housing, limits on corporate power) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to discredit the very idea that we can or should attempt those sorts of bold initiatives.
In economicist doctrine, it's actually &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to make national parks or social security or public healthcare, and people are naive to even think we should try. To the extent that these things actually exist and thrive and please people in the real world, they are mirages - they don't work in theory, so they must not work in practice, either.
It's not that progressives ignored economists. Some 5,000 economists worked with FDR to craft the New Deal. But while FDR employed a lot of economists, his successors set out to create full employment in the profession - by the 1980s, there were 16,000 federal economists.
&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1818725#metadata_info_tab_contents"&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1818725#metadata_info_tab_contents&lt;/a&gt;
In "May God Save Us From Economists," in the &lt;em&gt;New Republic&lt;/em&gt;, Timothy Noah takes us on a whirlwind tour of the disastrous rise of economism and the changing currents that are finally deprecating its ideology and methodology - and not a minute too soon.
&lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/168049/tyranny-economists-government"&gt;https://newrepublic.com/article/168049/tyranny-economists-government&lt;/a&gt;
In 1944, Paul Samuelson called World War II "the economist's war." JK Galbraith did research for the United States Strategic Bombing Survey that concluded that military doctrine overestimated the usefulness of aerial bombing. Milton Friedman tried and failed to use economics to develop high-temperature alloys. The Rand Institute developed the post-war nuclear "Mutually Assured Destruction" plan using economists, not military experts.
After the war, economics became the language of Washington. By 1967, the DOT's safety agencies took up economic models to determine when and how to deploy safety regulations. These regulations were weighed against a model that assigned a cash value to the human lives they'd save, and as that value changed from year to year, so did the regulations that were politically possible.
Today, the use of cost-benefit analyses that relied on arbitrary prices assigned to human lives is &lt;em&gt;mandatory&lt;/em&gt; for all major regulations:
&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12058"&gt;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12058&lt;/a&gt;
That means that federal economists aren't just in charge of economic policies - at the Fed, say, or the Congressional Budget Office - but rather, they have the final word on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; policy matters - every question has become an economic question. That's the core of economism.
From the middle of the 20th century on, economism gave rise to a near-endless supply of annoyances, miseries and horribles.
For example, economists convinced Carter to deregulate the airlines and turn legroom into a commodity that you pay extra for. That was the brainchild of then-chair of the Civil Aeronautics Board Alfred E Kahn, an economist, who cheerfully declared "I don't know one plane from another - to me, they are all marginal costs with wings."
Most consequentially, economists gutted antitrust, declaring monopolies to be efficient and ruling any questions of corporate power out of bounds on the grounds that it couldn't be measured or modeled in equations. This, in turn, made all other regulation a battle between concentrated sectors dominated by a handful of giant corporations and their would-be regulators. From here, it's a direct line to both "too big to fail" and "too big to jail."
Economism has had an enormous - and awful - impact on public health. It's no coincidence that when Johns Hopkins sent out a call for survey data early in the covid pandemic, two of its signatories were economists and only one was an epidemiologist:
&lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/from-our-experts/economists-and-epidemiologists-not-at-odds-but-in-agreement-we-need-a-broad-based-covid-19-testing-survey"&gt;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/from-our-experts/economists-and-epidemiologists-not-at-odds-but-in-agreement-we-need-a-broad-based-covid-19-testing-survey&lt;/a&gt;
As Noah writes: "Think about that. Hopkins medical school is consistently rated one of the top five in the country. Yet even there, an epidemiologist dared not make an uncontroversial public health pronouncement in the midst of a pandemic without invoking the unimpeachable authority of two economists."
Even Trump, who professed a hatred of "experts," bowed before economism: it was his trade advisor Peter Navarro who got Trump to take covid seriously, not his public health team (Navarro's PhD is in economics). And it was Navarro who got Trump to recommend useless - and potentially dangerous - hydroxychloroquine therapy for covid.
In 1992, the Nobel Prize in Economics went to Gary Becker, who used economics to explain "criminal justice, marriage, and racial discrimination."
&lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1992/becker/facts/"&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1992/becker/facts/&lt;/a&gt;
Related to this is the fact that the Economics Nobel isn't actually a Nobel at all - rather, it is part of economism's drive to subordinate evidence-based science to economicist ideology. The prize was created 73 years after the Nobel by Sweden's finance sector, who backed it with a perpetual grant, in a bid to establish that economics was a science:
&lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economics-nobel-isnt-really-a-nobel/"&gt;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economics-nobel-isnt-really-a-nobel/&lt;/a&gt;
Economism began to lose its shine after the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, which saw renewed interest in Karl Polanyi's 1944 anti-economism "Ur-text," "The Great Transformation," which argued that "economics was created by society and must be made to serve its needs."
&lt;a href="https://inctpped.ie.ufrj.br/spiderweb/pdf_4/Great_Transformation.pdf"&gt;https://inctpped.ie.ufrj.br/spiderweb/pdf_4/Great_Transformation.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Polanyi railed against the notion that the individual should respect economic law even if it happened to destroy him…. Nothing obscures our social vision as effectively as the economistic prejudice."
In the years after the GFC, Polanyi's anti-economism critique was updated and formalized into five major areas:
&lt;b&gt;I. Excessive reliance on models.&lt;/b&gt; Famously, Queen Elizabeth visited the London School of Economics and demanded to know why they hadn't predicted the Great Financial Crisis. Economic forecasting basically sucks, and even though it now consumes vastly more computing power and has vastly more data to crunch, it's only made the most marginal and tenuous improvements.
Noah rejects the comparison of economic forecasting to weather forecasting: since 1984, economic forecasting has incorporated 20,000 times more variables with few improvements; over the same period, the time horizon for weather forecasts has grown from a few days to a few weeks ("Hurricanes no longer surprise us. Financial crises still do").
Despite this, economicists continue to claim that models can solve our problems. In 1991, Larry Summers (ugh) said, "the laws of economics, it’s often forgotten, are like the laws of engineering. There’s only one set of laws and they work everywhere."
Summers' economicist doctrine was at work in post-Soviet Russia, where the models confidently predicted that an "open economy" would be unleash massive growth. Instead, it delivered "a semi-fascist and not terribly prosperous kleptocracy."
&lt;b&gt;II. Underreliance on data.&lt;/b&gt; As Ely Devons famously quipped, "If economists wished to study the horse, they wouldn’t go and look at horses. They’d sit in their studies and say to themselves, ‘What would I do if I were a horse?’"
As Robert Skidelsky wrote, an economics that can't validate its hypotheses empirically "has a strong tendency to slide into ideology."
In the pre-economicist age, economists focused on "history and the dynamics of change." These were the New Deal "institutional economists" of the 1930s, who were supplanted by the more math-heavy Keynesians and then the purely theoretical neo-classicals. These economists were seduced by "beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics," which they "mistook for truth," in the words of Paul Krugman.
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html&lt;/a&gt;
The difficulty of finding data and the seductive power of models produced an establishment that dismissed the evidence before them, and common sense, as inconsistent with the theory and thus wrong. This is how the "virtual consensus" that minimum wage hikes increase unemployment was born, and it's why the minimum wage stagnated at $7.25, lower in real terms that the minimum wage MLK marched against in 1963.
&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677856#metadata_info_tab_contents"&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677856#metadata_info_tab_contents&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;III. A rejection of society.&lt;/b&gt; At the core of economism is a rejection of the very idea of society ("There is no such thing as society" - M. Thatcher). The only way to understand our lives is to model us as individuals, making individual choices and expressing individual preferences. Economism gives short shrift to how individuals affect one another.
Nowhere is this more visible than in Garrett Hardin's 1968 hoax "The Tragedy of the Commons," which purported to be a factual account of how people in communities persistently and reliably failed to manage common resources (Hardin, a eugenicist, was later revealed to have made the whole thing up):
&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/10/01/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-how-ecofascism-was-smuggled-into-mainstream-thought/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2019/10/01/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-how-ecofascism-was-smuggled-into-mainstream-thought/&lt;/a&gt;
The actual nature of how people manage commons is far more interesting. Elinor Ostrom - one of the few women to have been given an economics "Nobel" - has devoted her career to analyzing and explaining the long, factual history of well-managed commons, some of which have been run successfully for centuries:
&lt;a href="https://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons"&gt;https://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;IV. A failure to understand "irrationality."&lt;/b&gt; In the neoclassical model humans are present as "rational utility-maximizing agents" whose actions can be predicted by asking "What would this person rationally do to get the most out of their situation" (e.g. "What would I do if I was a horse?").
In the early 2000s, the "behavioral economists" turned the profession upside-down by taking the radical step of observing how people &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; behaved, which turned out to bear little relation to the &lt;em&gt;homo economicus&lt;/em&gt; of the models.
This "irrationality" could also often be called "ethics" - for example, the decision in various "ultimatum games" to punish selfish people, even if it means getting less for yourself. You can view this as "irrationality" if your sole conception of human motivation is "how do I get more for myself?" But you can equally say, "I don't like people who betray the social contract and I am prepared to go with less if it means punishing them."
But by insisting that ethics are irrational, economism can actually do away with them. Michael Sandel's 2012 book "What Money Can’t Buy," offers examples of things that shouldn't be subject to market forces, like concierge medical services. A decade later, these have gone from examples of the unthinkable to actual products.
&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533656/whatmoneycantbuy"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533656/whatmoneycantbuy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;V. The prejudices of economism.&lt;/B&gt; Economists themselves are more likely to behave like "economic man," "pursuing self-interest at the expense of cooperation":
&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268111000746"&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268111000746&lt;/a&gt;
Economists also give less to charity than other sorts of people:
&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268111000746#!"&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268111000746#!&lt;/a&gt;
It is one of the least racially and gender-diverse of all disciplines:
&lt;a href="https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-economics-phds-are-less-socioeconomically-and-racially-diverse-other-major"&gt;https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-economics-phds-are-less-socioeconomically-and-racially-diverse-other-major&lt;/a&gt;
It's one thing for a profession to be so different from the majority - but when that profession has elevated itself to the final arbiter of all regulation and government, its narrow composition and ideological blinkers start to tell.
Thus far, the response to this critique has been to reform the economics profession - the Hewlett, Omidyar, Ford and Open Society Foundations are all pursuing programs to make economics better. But Noah argues that it's not enough to fix economics, we also have to restore &lt;em&gt;politics&lt;/em&gt; as a project separate from economics.
Economics should be a &lt;em&gt;tool&lt;/em&gt; in politics, but not a replacement for it. As a start, Noah proposes three political domains where economics does not belong:
&lt;b&gt;I. Criminal justice.&lt;/b&gt; Get rid of private pretrial supervision, where people charged with a crime have to pay a corporation "user fees" for their ankle-bracelet and other monitoring, or rot in jail. Get rid of private prisons. Get rid of private immigration detention.
To the extent that these "save taxpayers money," they do so by "running their facilities on the cheap." Private prisons have "more assaults, more inmate grievances, more lockdowns, and nearly twice as many guns and other weapons confiscated from prisoners."
&lt;a href="https://oig.justice.gov/reports/review-federal-bureau-prisons-monitoring-contract-prisons"&gt;https://oig.justice.gov/reports/review-federal-bureau-prisons-monitoring-contract-prisons&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;II. Health care.&lt;/b&gt; After a century of "ever-more ambitious experiments to see whether medical services can be made broadly available on a for-profit basis" the verdict is in: "Every experiment failed." Every private healthcare scheme fails for the same reason: "The market doesn’t want society to share equally in paying the cost of health care. It wants the biggest consumers (i.e., the sickest people) to pay more. A lot more. That’s how markets work."
Private insurance failed when companies started "charging riskier customers higher premiums and avoiding very risky customers altogether." That led to HMOs, which failed when "rising health care costs eventually made even premiums for HMOs too expensive."
Then we let doctors buy interest in labs and drugs and machinery, charge unlimited fees, and become "entrepreneurs." We shut public hospitals and let for-profits consolidate hospitals into massive chains. Prices went up. Care got worse. Failure.
Obamacare - which tries to have a private system paid for out of the public purse - has also failed, as costs have gone up, premiums have risen, and outcomes have worsened. We're on track to outspend the budget for Medicare for All on a private system that delivers worse outcomes to fewer patients.
Many, many studies have concluded that private insurers &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; deliver better care at lower prices. Private insurers pay nearly double the rate that Medicare gets from hospitals.
&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/how-much-more-than-medicare-do-private-insurers-pay-a-review-of-the-literature/"&gt;https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/how-much-more-than-medicare-do-private-insurers-pay-a-review-of-the-literature/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;III. The climate emergency.&lt;/B&gt; We are barreling towards a planet incapable of sustaining human life. There is no longer a "credible pathway to a 1.5C rise."
&lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022"&gt;https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022&lt;/a&gt;
The economics trade has an answer. In 2019, 28 "Nobel" laureates in economics called a carbon tax "the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary." Three years later, emissions are &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;, not down.
&lt;a href="https://www.econstatement.org/"&gt;https://www.econstatement.org/&lt;/a&gt;
Thankfully, the economicist answer to the greatest existential risk facing human civilization today is no longer the only answer we're willing to try. The Inflation Reduction Act puts $369b worth of public money into directly subsidizing green energy and green tech.
It doesn't include a carbon tax.

&lt;h1&gt;Amazon's relentless personal data foot-dragging (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/27/beware-of-the-leopard/#relentless"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Sometimes, the best way to understand a failure is to contrast it with a success. Take Amazon, whose avowed "relentlessness" created next-day Prime delivery and AWS, with its power to instantaneously, continuously emit "buckets" of data.
Amazon boasts endlessly about its efficiency, ease of use and speed - which means that whenever you find Amazon being inefficient, hard to use and slow, it's reasonable to assume that this is a deliberate choice. Like, say, when Amazon is giving you the data it has collected on you.
Nikita Mazurov is a security and privacy researcher with &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;. Noting that Amazon is now legally required (under California's #CCPA) to show him all the data it has gathered on him, he placed a request for that data. Therein begins the tale.
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/03/27/amazon-personal-data-request-dark-pattern/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2022/03/27/amazon-personal-data-request-dark-pattern/&lt;/a&gt;
Amazon - home of one-day delivery of physical goods - took &lt;em&gt;19 days&lt;/em&gt; to deliver that data. During those 19 days, it required Mazurov to jump through innumerable hoops, and, on &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; separate occasions, tried to divert him to his "Your Account" page where "you can access a lot of your data instantly."
The data, when delivered, came as &lt;em&gt;74 separate .zip files&lt;/em&gt;, with no "download all" button. Once Mazurov manually downloaded those files - clicking 74 links in succession and piecing the data together - it became apparent that the thin, sanitized stream of data on his "Your Account" page was a translucent scrim over a massive block of data Amazon had squirreled away on him.
It's...&lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;: search keywords, chat logs, conversations with buyers and sellers, your IP addresses, how many search results you click on/add to your basket/buy, and mystery data like "Shopping Refinement" whose values are things like "26,444,740,832,600,000."
Amazon retains data you've explicitly deleted (like old shipping addresses), which exposes you to risk by providing answers to other services' verification questions ("What was your first street address?").
There are also files on everything you watched on Prime Video, everything you read on a Kindle, everything you listened to on Amazon Music, everything you uttered to an Alexa, and every game you played on Amazon Games. Mazurov doesn't use these, so he wasn't able to say how detailed they are, but given the overall level of detail, it's likely pretty granular.
This is where the contrast between Amazon's failures and successes come in. As Mazurov notes, one of the zip files lists &lt;em&gt;167 corporations&lt;/em&gt; who were sold access to his personal data, ranging from the Royal Bank of Canada to Fitbit to HCA Healthcare. It's a sure bet that when Amazon sells your data to these customers, it comes as a ready-to-use product, not 74 .zip files.
The gap between Amazon's "relentless" efficiency and its bumbling, Kafkaeque data delivery couldn't be more stark. Think of Amazon's product philosophy, it's one-click, Buy Now seamlessness versus this clunky, foot-dragging malicious compliance.
Here's Amazon's design philosophy: "If you have to click multiple buttons, if you have to wait for too long, if you have to answer a lot of information — all of those things create friction, and friction exponentially kills the joy of shopping."
&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amazon-rising/"&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/amazon-rising/&lt;/a&gt;
When Amazon is getting something from you, it is a marvel of efficiency. As Mazurov points out, when you want your data &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; Amazon, you fill in a form, then another form, then get misdirected six times to the "Your Account" page. Meanwhile, when Amazon wants to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; your data, it &lt;em&gt;takes&lt;/em&gt; it, silently, efficiently, insatiably - and relentlessly.
Amazon doesn't let the sensitivity of that data interfere with its product development, either. In contrast to its competitors, Amazon has a long history of treating customer records as a free-for-all, with no effective controls on how internal teams can access, copy and use your data.
&lt;a href="https://revealnews.org/article/inside-amazons-failures-to-protect-your-data-internal-voyeurs-bribery-schemes-and-backdoor-access/"&gt;https://revealnews.org/article/inside-amazons-failures-to-protect-your-data-internal-voyeurs-bribery-schemes-and-backdoor-access/&lt;/a&gt;
That has led to innumerable, completely predictable scandals, including insider attacks that spied on users - and blackmailed them. The company sidelined the security professionals it hired to clean up these processes, treating them as overly cautious killjoys. Eventually, it solved the problem by promoting unqualified people who wouldn't raise inconvenient objections - leading to a world-class breach:
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-failed-to-protect-your-data-investigation/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-failed-to-protect-your-data-investigation/&lt;/a&gt;
Mazurov wondered if this chaotic data-handling practice might be behind Amazon's sluggish response to his request, but an Amazon's spokesperson vigorously denied that the company's security incompetence was to blame for its inability to deliver his data in a timely fashion.
Mazurov calls all the misdirection and delay a "dark pattern," revealing just how broad (verging on useless) that term has become. We have a perfectly well-understood term for telling a user that the "Your Account" screen has the data they're seeking when it doesn't. We call that "a lie."
I think we should get back to calling tech company fraud "fraud," rather than "dark patterns." It's one thing to have a giant "OK" button and a tiny, grey-on-white "I do not consent" link hidden in a corner of the screen. But when we call straight-up frauds "dark patterns," we engage in "criti-hype" - Lee Vinsel's term for criticism that amplifies the tech companies' own self-mythologizing:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/30/dont-believe-the-criti-hype/#ordinary-mediocrities"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/30/dont-believe-the-criti-hype/#ordinary-mediocrities&lt;/a&gt;
"Dark patterns" implies some kind of data-driven mastery of the blind spots of the human critical faculty. But when you try to buy n plane tickets from Fareportal and it shows you a false message stating that there are n+1 left, that's not a "dark pattern," that's "lying."
&lt;a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2022/03/21/holding-purveyors-of-dark-patterns-for-online-travel-bookings-accountable/"&gt;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2022/03/21/holding-purveyors-of-dark-patterns-for-online-travel-bookings-accountable/&lt;/a&gt;
Amazon's data handling looks chaotic from the outside. For example, it somehow managed to delete Nelson Minar's entire history from Goodreads: 600 titles, 250 reviews.
&lt;a href="https://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/goodreads-lost-all-my-data.html"&gt;https://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/goodreads-lost-all-my-data.html&lt;/a&gt;
Minar thinks it might have been a malicious deletion request from someone who hacked his account and then used CCPA to demand deletion to cover their tracks:
&lt;a href="https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-cancel-my-account-1553870935772"&gt;https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-cancel-my-account-1553870935772&lt;/a&gt;
But as we see with Mazurov's case, Amazon has more than one way to handle those requests. When retrieval might reveal Amazon's overcollection, the company takes 19 days to comply, and tries to divert you to a misleading page six times. When you explicitly delete information from Amazon that it can use for data-mining, it keeps the data and flags it "Is Address Active: No."
This all makes sense when you recognize that Amazon's relentlessness is pursuit of profit, not provision of service. Amazon &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; provide good service when it is profitable to do so - but when it is more profitable to put you at risk, then that's the choice it makes.

Maine's years under the racist, lying, corrupt governor Paul LePage (2003-11) weren't just a lost decade - they were a decade of looting and starving the state and its capacities, so that, a decade later, Maine is still a laggard, its institutions a national disgrace.
Front and center: Maine's public defender system - or rather, its lack of one. Maine is the only state in the union without a Public Defender's Office. Instead, they pay private attorneys rock-bottom prices to represent indigent Mainers facing criminal charges.
Perhaps you've heard horror stories about overworked, underresourced PDs in other states. They're true. But compared to Maine's system, even the worst PD's office in the union is a white-shoe law-firm of the sort you'd expect to find repping Trump or Epstein.
Maine's rapsheet and the evidence against it are laid out today in a devastating Propublica/Main Monitor piece by Samantha Hogan: "Maine Hires Lawyers With Criminal Records to Defend Its Poorest Residents."
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/maine-hires-lawyers-with-criminal-records-to-defend-its-poorest-residents"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/maine-hires-lawyers-with-criminal-records-to-defend-its-poorest-residents&lt;/a&gt;
Hogan reveals a system whose lawyers are child pornographers, fraudsters, sexual harassers, flashers, drunks, and felons, some of whom can't even visit their clients in jail because doing so would violate their probation.
The system came about after Maine lawmakers under LePage passed "tough-on-crime" bills that turned everyday misdemeanors into felonies, packing state courts with people facing hard time.
Simultaneously, Maine's austerity-crazed state-house choked the court's budget and put the state judicial branch in charge of a single (wildly inadequate) pot of money to pay both prosecutors AND defenders.
This system was so untenable that anything else looked good by comparison. That "anything else" is the Commission on Indigent Legal Services, run by John Pelletier, a LePage-era ideologue who insists there is nothing wrong with his Commission.
He claims the beauty of his system is that it lets poor defendants hire the same lawyer they'd get if they could afford one.
Since the Commission's founding, 161 Maine lawyers have been "disbarred, suspended or reprimanded for misconduct."
Pelletier hired a quarter of them.
Now, Pelletier might say that this system is working great. After all, his own office has produced no documentary evidence of problems with it! But perhaps that has something to do with the fact that the system has no oversight mechanism?
The state legislature understands that something is horribly wrong here - if the gross miscarriages of justice weren't sufficient evidence, then perhaps the runaway billing fraud convinced them. They told Pelletier he needed to hire eight more staffers. He hired two.
The legislature has continued to investigate Pelletier's Commission, calling him to testify to a bipartisan body. Pelletier "repeatedly provided inaccurate or incomplete information to the commissioners."
Meanwhile, here's a sampling of some of the defenders Pelletier has hired:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter Mason: repeatedly accused of exposing himself to female clients, pled guilty to indecent conduct (Mason is cleared to work on sex offender cases!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seth Carey: Criminally investigated for sexual assault. Disciplined by judges for "blatantly disingenous" courtroom conduct. Accused of attempting to force a female client to perform oral sex on him, offered her $1K and his car note in exchange for an NDA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Pelletier kept Carey on despite all this, and he'd be defending indigent clients today but for the fact that his law license was suspended for three years)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawrence Winger: a self-described "pornography addict" who did time for possession of (a lot of) child pornography. Winger discovered his interest in criminal defense while serving his prison sentence. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
(He is not allowed to visit some of his clients because entering a jail violates his probation; he "simply hopes" that none of his clients are rearrested after he is assigned to them)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suzanne Dwyer-Jones: DUIs, previously lost her license after a judge said her addiction and mental health issues were a "substantial threat of irreparable harm to the public"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
(Dwyer-Jones bailed on a client with dementia and a recent stroke who couldn't understand a restraining order requiring him to stay away from his girlfriend's house; once he switched lawyers, his charges were dismissed after he was ruled incompetent to stand trial)
In Pelletier's system, it's not just your lawyer who represents a threat to your safety: Nicholas R Moffo evaluates petitions for a publicly funded defender on behalf of the Commission.
Moffo has been previously convicted of third-degree larceny related to workplace theft.
During the police investigation of his crimes, Moffo threatened to "burn down the home and kill the family" of a colleague he was worried would talk to police; he showed his guns to another and threatened to kill anyone who "ratted" on him.
Moffo was forced to surrender his guns - more than a dozen of them! - after a "domestic incident" with his ex-, who told police she was "deathly afraid" of him.
Pelletier knows about Moffo's past: a former commission employee, Pamela Slye, told him about it.
If you are indigent and need a lawyer, Moffo is the guy who reviews your case: he gets unsupervised access to your bank details, your SSN, your phone number and your home address, and whether you live alone.
The states are sometimes called the "laboratories of democracy," where experiments in better government can be tried and evaluated. Maine's privatized, Republican, austerity-crazed, "free market" public defense experiment is an unmitigated failure.
It's past time to shut the experiment down, decontaminate the lab and put the lab's chiefs in front of a tribunal for gross misconduct and criminal negligence.

&lt;h1&gt;America's wild hog "pig bomb" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/06/hybrid-vigor/#porcs"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
America's feral hog problem has become a "pig bomb." Wild pigs have mated with escaped farm pigs bred for high rates of reproduction producing a hybrid that is growing like crazy.
&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/09/wild-pigs-are-everywhere/616389/"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/09/wild-pigs-are-everywhere/616389/&lt;/a&gt;
Hybrid vigor is scary: these pigs are super smart, learn to avoid gunfire, switch to a nocturnal schedule if they are hunted. They harbor a multitude of human-infecting pathogens and do $2.5b/year of damage to crops and livestock and have laid waste to habitats and preserves.
They roam over a 19 mi territory, which expands when they are actively hunted. Add to that dumbasses who've imported and released wild pigs into new territories for "recreational hunting."
After several brushes with pig-based crises, Montana licked its pig problem (for now) with stiff penalties, extensive surveillance, and a high-dollar "Squeal on Pigs" tipline.
Other states - and Canadian provinces, which are seeing surging wild pig populations - are looking to Montana for guidance.
There's an estimated 9m feral hogs in the US, and their territory has expanded from 17 states 30 years ago to at least 39 states today.
Their territory is expanding at 35,000 miles/year and they've reached crisis levels in Florida, California, Georgia and Texas.

&lt;h1&gt;Monopoly so fragile (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/29/efficient-markets-hypothesis/#too-big-to-sail"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
A big boat stuck in the Suez Canal, catastrophically disrupting global logistics - it wasn't just predictable, it was inevitable. For decades, the shipping industry has consolidated into just a few companies, and ships got bigger - too big to sail.
As Matthew Stoller points out, in 2000 the ten biggest shippers controlled 12% of the market, today, it's more that 82%, and even that number is misleadingly rosy because of alliances among the megashippers that effectively turn them into one company.
&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/what-we-can-learn-from-a-big-boat"&gt;https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/what-we-can-learn-from-a-big-boat&lt;/a&gt;
The Suez crisis illustrates one of the less-appreciated harms of monopoly: all of us are dunderheads at least some of the time. When a single person wields a lot of unchecked power, their follies, errors and blind-spots take on global consequence.
The "efficiencies" of the new class of megaships - the Ever Given weighs 220 kilotons and is as long as the Empire State Building - were always offset by risks, such as the risk of getting stuck in a canal or harbor.
Despite this, a handful of executives were able to green-light their deployment. Either these execs didn't believe the experts, or they didn't care (maybe they thought they'd retire before the crisis) or they thought they could externalize the costs onto the rest of us.
Running a complex system is a game of risk mitigation: not just making a system that works as well as possible, but also making one that fails as well as possible. Build the Titanic if you must, but for the love of God, make sure it has enough life-boats.
Monopolies are brittle. The ideology that underpins them is fundamentally eugenic: that there exists among us superbeings, genetic sports who were born with the extraordinary insights and genius that entitle them to rule over the rest of us.
If we let nature run its course, these benevolent dictators will usher in an era of global prosperity.
This is catastrophically, idiotically, manifestly wrong. First, even people who are very smart about some things are very stupid about other things.
Charles Koch took over his father's hydrocarbon empire and correctly concluded that the industry was being held back by a focus on short-term profits. He made a series of long-term bets on new production technologies and grew the business a thousandfold.
Being patient and farsighted made Koch one of the richest people in world history - and one of the most influential. He pioneered a kind of slow, patient policy entrepreneurship, investing in a network of think-tanks that mainstreamed his extremist ideology over decades.
And yet, this man who became a billionaire and changed the character of global politics with his foresight has managed to convince himself that there is no climate emergency. That patience, foresight, and cool weighing of probabilities have gone out the window completely.
Smart people are often fools (so are regular people). History is full of them. Take William Shockley, the Nobel-winning inventor of silicon transistors who failed in industry because he became obsessed with eugenics and devoted his life to a racist sterilization campaign.
Moreover, fools sometimes succeed. Take Mark Zuckerberg, who justified his self-serving "real names" policy (which makes it easier to target ads by banning pseudonyms) by claiming that any attempt to present yourself in different ways to different people is "two-faced."
That is a genuinely idiotic thing to believe: presenting yourself differently to your lover, your parents, your toddler, your boss and your friends isn't "two-faced," it's human. To do otherwise would be monstrous.
But even when monopolists aren't idiots, they are still dangerous. The problem with Zuck isn't merely that he's uniquely unsuited to being the unaccountable czar of 2.6 billion peoples' social lives - it's that no one should have that job.
Monopolists all have their own cherished idiocies (as do the rest of us), but they share a common pathology: the ideology, popularized by Thomas Friedman and others, that "efficiency" is the highest virtue.
The whole basis for 40 years of tolerating (even encouraging) monopolies is the efficiencies of scale that come from consolidating power into a few hands, and the shared interests that arise from a brittle interdependence.
Who would go to war with the trading partner that controls the world's supply of some essential item?
This was always, predictably, a system that would work well but fail badly. Clustering the world's semiconductor production in Taiwan made chips cheap and plentiful, sure.
But then the 1999 Taiwan quake shut down all the world's computer sales. There are plenty of examples like this that Stoller lists: a single vaccine factory in England shuts down in 2004 and the US loses half of its flu vaccines.
Despite the increasing tempo of supply-chain crises that ripple out across the world, we have allowed monopolists to "take the fat out of the system at every joint," setting up a thousand crises among us and yet to come.
Bedding makers can't make mattress for want of foam. RV manufacturers can't get enough "air conditioners, fridges, furniture" to meet orders. Often, the pivotal items are obscure and utterly critical, like the $1 "flat steel form ties," without which home construction halts.
"For the want of a nail, the shoe was lost." We've understood that tightly coupled systems have cascading failures since the 13th century. "Resiliency" is inefficient - but only if you ignore what happens when brittle systems fail.
Every monopolist &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; shares an ideology that elevates brittleness to a virtue. They must, because monopolies are brittle. One foolish mistake, one ship wedged in a canal, one delusive denial of climate change, and we all suffer.
Every monopolist believes in their own infallibility. They must, because to have someone as fallible as me or you in charge of the world's social media or shipping or flat steel ties is otherwise a recipe for disaster.
Of all the dangerous things monopolists are wrong about, this belief in their own inability to be wrong is the most dangerous.

&lt;h1&gt;Noble Lies (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/29/efficient-markets-hypothesis/#masks-and-trade"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Last June, Anthony Fauci admitted that he lied when he told Americans that cloth masks wouldn't stop covid spread; it was what Noah Smith calls a "noble lie," told to prevent a run on N95 masks needed by front-line workers.
&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/502890-fauci-why-the-public-wasnt-told-to-wear-masks"&gt;https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/502890-fauci-why-the-public-wasnt-told-to-wear-masks&lt;/a&gt;
The lie was repeated by the CDC and WHO, who reasoned that any admission that cloth masks worked would lead people to conclude that N95s worked better and then all the N95s would be hoarded and the relief efforts would grind to a halt.
On balance, this wasn't a good call. Much of the ongoing controversy about masks can be traced back to this. We didn't go from "don't mask" to "must mask" merely because of evolving scientific understanding.
That shift is also attributable to a tactical choice to start telling the truth. But once the public understands that experts sometimes deliberately lie to them, it creates an epistemological void.
Most of us aren't qualified to understand the ins and outs of masking, so we trust the process - the neutral, truthful adjudication of different expert theories by public bodies and scientific institutions that do their best to get it right and admit when they're wrong.
If you can't trust that, you're left to "do the research" on every technical life-or-death question, from food safety to construction materials to the software in the 737 Max. Even if you're qualified to resolve some of this, no one is qualified to resolve all of it.
The noble lie is the most destructive of all, because it erodes trust in the system, shattering the only mechanism we have for arriving at a common understanding of reality.
To understand how this plays out over the long term, Smith points to the 40 years' worth of economists' noble lying about free trade. While nearly all economists agree that there are net benefits to trade, there has been a concerted effort to oversimplify those benefits.
&lt;a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/yes-experts-will-lie-to-you-sometimes"&gt;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/yes-experts-will-lie-to-you-sometimes&lt;/a&gt;
Within economics, experts agree that trade produces winners and losers, and the idea that trade makes us all better off depends on the winners compensating the losers. But from NAFTA to the WTO and beyond, this has been missing from the public discourse on trade.
This has real-world consequences: "Workers displaced by competition with China after its entry into the WTO in 2001 tended to be permanently hurt by the shock. Some went on welfare, some found jobs for half what they used to make."
&lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w21906"&gt;https://www.nber.org/papers/w21906&lt;/a&gt;
As Smith points out, no one who extols the benefits of trade for a popular audience says, "Well, we're also going to make millions of people permanently worse off unless we create a social safety net that transfers the benefits of trade from winners to losers."
Economists worry that the public's biases - against foreigners, markets and the elimination of "make-work" jobs - made them incapable of handling the truth about trade, so they just skipped over the harms - indeed, they insisted there were no harms.
This...didn't work out well. The first nationally successful campaign that focused on the truth about trade was run by a belligerent, racist fool, who was able to leverage the public's distrust of the expert consensus to become president and kill half a million people.
As Smith says, being an expert on economics or epidemiology does not make you an expert on when you should lie.

&lt;h1&gt;Big Salmon's aquaturf (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/29/efficient-markets-hypothesis/#aquaturf"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Salmon farming is a catastrophe: the deep, rectangular nets full of close-packed salmon have all the problems of any feedlot: rampant pathogen spread worsened by flushing of tons of shit into the ecosystem.
Mature aquaculture operations acknowledge this: new operations build solid enclosures, siphon off the waste and sell it as a valuable byproduct. But for existing aquaculture giants, it's cheaper to go on destroying the environment and driving wild salmon to extinction.
That cost-benefit analysis holds even when you factor in the expense of smearing and terrorizing the scientists who explain how they are poisoning the oceans and endangering a food-web that stretches all the way from salmon to orcas.
The woman on the receiving end of that aquaturf smear campaign is Alexandra Morton, a scientist whose Google results are a long run of astroturfed articles accusing her of being some kind of shill for Big Nature, a thing that does not exist.
&lt;a href="https://www.alexandramorton.ca/"&gt;https://www.alexandramorton.ca/&lt;/a&gt;
Today on Canadaland, Jessebrown interviews Morton, talking about the weird, shadow-media empire that exists to make scientifically dubious claims about the safety of farmed salmon and to question Morton's sound science.
&lt;a href="https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/364-fake-news-from-fish-farms/"&gt;https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/364-fake-news-from-fish-farms/&lt;/a&gt;
Central to that campaign is Sea West News, whose founding editor, Fabian Dawson, runs a PR consultancy that develops "issue-related and fundraising campaigns and delivers measurable results for organizations like the BC Salmon Farmers Association."
&lt;a href="https://www.fabiandawson.com/projects"&gt;https://www.fabiandawson.com/projects&lt;/a&gt;
As Canadaland reports, the forerunners to Sea West News were a series of Facebook posts by Dawson, including claims that Canadian environmentalists and First Nations activists were a front for a conspiracy of US monied interests.
"Money from America flows unabated to Canadian eco-activists and disparate First Nations groups to disrupt everything from sustainable salmon farms to pipelines"
Dawson reposted articles claiming protests against salmon farms were "US funded...fake-news tactics of hired protesters."
&lt;a href="https://www.canadaland.com/salmon-farm-industry-seawestnews/"&gt;https://www.canadaland.com/salmon-farm-industry-seawestnews/&lt;/a&gt;
Brown adds that Dawson benefits from federal subsidies in his role an immigration reporter for the Local Journalism Initiative-backed New Canadian Media.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/6a0120a56ab882970c022ad3604ab3200c-800wi.jpg"/&gt;
The harassment that Morton faces is by no means limited to online trolling. Her field research at Marine Harvest's massive farms has been dogged by crew boats with blacked-out windows registered to a consultancy called Black Cube.
&lt;a href="https://alexandramorton.typepad.com/alexandra_morton/2018/08/"&gt;https://alexandramorton.typepad.com/alexandra_morton/2018/08/&lt;/a&gt;
The Tel Aviv-based Black Cube are some of the blackest black-ops corporate spooks in the world - if they sound familiar, perhaps it's  because they were the ones that Harvey Weinstein hired to stalk his victims and neutralize them.
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/harvey-weinstein-black-cube-new-york-times"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/harvey-weinstein-black-cube-new-york-times&lt;/a&gt;
Or maybe you're thinking of the time that the cyber-mercenaries at the NSO Group (whose tools were used to entrap Jamal Khashoggi), hired them to infiltrate the academic human rights research group Citizen Lab.
&lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/04/dubious-denials-scripted-spin-spyware-company-nso-group-goes-on-60-minutes/"&gt;https://citizenlab.ca/2019/04/dubious-denials-scripted-spin-spyware-company-nso-group-goes-on-60-minutes/&lt;/a&gt;
Marine Harvest - who are involved in high-stakes ligitation with Morton and BC First Nations - admits they hired Black Cube, but insist that this is a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; Black Cube.
Weird flex but ok.
Some of BC's salmon runs are down by 99.9%, and Morton makes a compelling - peer reviewed, scientifically sound - case that this is the result of aquaculture giants whose profits would be lessened if they contained parasites and waste from their floating feedlots.
Despite this, Brown's interview with Morton ends on a hopeful note: thanks to action from BC First Nations and the BC provincial government and courts, the noose is tightening around companies like Marine Harvest.
Morton has just published NOT ON MY WATCH, a book documenting her decades-long struggle to save the salmon and the ocean, which earned her the appelation, "the Jane Goodall of Canada."

This week on my podcast, I read my November 2020 Locus column, "Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Results," about ML and AL, and the fallacy that improvements to statistical inference will someday produce a conscious, cognitive software construct.
Theory-free statistical inference can do some amazing things, but one thing it absolutely cannot do is understand. While there's no widely accepted definition of "intelligence," understanding features heavily in all the different debates.
&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/11/cory-doctorow-past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2020/11/cory-doctorow-past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/&lt;/a&gt;
Adding more data or more compute-power to machine learning doesn't make it capable of comprehension - no more than improvements in horse-breeding will someday produce an internal combustion engine.

&lt;h1&gt;The IRS will do your taxes for you (if that's what you prefer) (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/17/free-as-in-freefile/#tell-me-something-i-dont-know"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
America is a world leader in allowing private companies to levy taxes on its citizens, including (stay with me here), &lt;em&gt;a tax on paying your taxes&lt;/em&gt;.
In most of the world, the tax authorities prepare a return for each taxpayer, sending them a prepopulated form with all their tax details - collected from employers and other regulated entities, like pension funds and commodities brokers, who must report income to the tax office. If the form is correct, the taxpayer signs it and sends it back (in some countries, taxpayers don't even have to do that - they just ignore the return unless they want to amend it).
No one has to use this system, of course. If you have complex finances, or cash income that doesn't show up in mandatory reporting, or if you'd just prefer to prepare your own return or pay an accountant to do so for you, you can. But for the majority of people, those with income from a job or a pension, and predictable deductions, say, from caring for minor children, filing your annual tax return takes between zero and five minutes and costs absolutely nothing.
Not so in America. America is one of the very few rich countries (including Canada, though this is changing), where the government won't just send you a form containing all the information it already has, ready to file. As is common in complex societies, America has a complex tax code (further complexified by deliberate obfuscation by billionaires and their lickspittle Congressjerks, who deliberately perforate the tax code with loopholes for the ultra-rich):
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/11/the-canada-variant/#shitty-man-of-history-theory"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/11/the-canada-variant/#shitty-man-of-history-theory&lt;/a&gt;
That complexity means that most of us can't figure out how to file our own taxes, at least not without committing scarce hours out of the only life we will ever have to poring over the ramified and obscure maze of tax-law.
Why doesn't the IRS just send you a tax-return? Well, because the tax-prep industry - an oligopoly dominated by a handful of massive, ultra-profitable firms - bribes Congress (that is, "lobbies") to prohibit this. They are aided in this endeavor by swivel-eyed lunatic anti-tax obsessives, like Grover Nordquist and Americans for Tax Reform, who argue that paying taxes should be as difficult and painful as possible in order to foment opposition to taxation itself.
The tax-prep industry is dominated by a single firm, Intuit, who took over tax-prep through its anticompetitive acquisition of TurboTax, itself a chimera of multiple companies gobbled up in a decades-long merger orgy. Inuit is a &lt;em&gt;freaky&lt;/em&gt; company. For decades, its defining CEO Brad Smith ran the company as a cult of personality organized around his trite sayings, like "Do whatever makes your heart beat fastest," stenciled on T-shirts worn by employees. Other employees donned Brad Smith masks for selfies with their Beloved Leader.
Smith's cult also spent decades lobbying to keep the IRS from offering a free filing service. Instead, Intuit joined a cartel that offered a "Free File" service to some low- and medium-income Americans:
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free&lt;/a&gt;
But the cartel sabotaged Free File from the start. They blocked search engines from indexing their Free File services, then bought Google ads for "free file" that directed searchers to soundalike programs ("Free Filing," etc) that hit them for hundreds of dollars in tax-prep fees. They also funneled users to versions of Free File they were ineligible for, a fact that was only revealed after the user spent hours painstakingly entering their financial information, whereupon they would be told that they could either start over or pay hundreds of dollars to finish filing with a commercial product.
Intuit also pioneered the use of binding arbitration waivers that stripped its victims of the right to sue the company after it defrauded them. This tactic blew up in Intuit's face after its victims banded together to mass-file thousands of arbitration claims, sending the company to court to argue that binding arbitration wasn't enforceable after all:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/24/uber-for-arbitration/#nibbled-to-death-by-ducks"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/24/uber-for-arbitration/#nibbled-to-death-by-ducks&lt;/a&gt;
But justice eventually caught up with Intuit. After a series of stinging exposes by &lt;em&gt;Propublica&lt;/em&gt; journalists Justin Elliot, Paul Kiel and others, NY Attorney General Letitia James led a coalition of AGs from all 50 states and DC that extracted a $141m settlement for 4.4 million Americans who had been tricked into paying for Turbotax services they were entitled to get for free:
&lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/turbotax-to-begin-payouts-after-it-cheated-customers-new-york-ag-says/ar-AA1aNXfi"&gt;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/turbotax-to-begin-payouts-after-it-cheated-customers-new-york-ag-says/ar-AA1aNXfi&lt;/a&gt;
Fines are one thing, but the only way to comprehensively end the predatory tax-prep scam is to bring the USA kicking and screaming into the 20th century, when most of the rest of the world brought in free tax-prep for ordinary income earners. That's just what's happening: the IRS is trialing a free tax prep service for next year's tax season:
&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/05/15/irs-free-file/"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/05/15/irs-free-file/&lt;/a&gt;
This, despite Intuit's all-out blitz attack on Congress and the IRS to keep free tax-prep from ever reaching the American people:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/20/turbotaxed/#counter-intuit"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/20/turbotaxed/#counter-intuit&lt;/a&gt;
That charm offensive didn't stop the IRS from releasing a banger of a report that made it clear that free tax-prep was the most efficient, humane and cost-effective way to manage an advanced tax-system (something the rest of the world has known for decades):
&lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5788.pdf"&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5788.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Of course, Intuit is furious, as in spitting feathers. Rick Heineman, Intuit's spokesprofiteer, told KQED that "A direct-to-IRS e-file system is wholly redundant and is nothing more than a solution in search of a problem. That solution will unnecessarily cost taxpayers billions of dollars and especially harm the most vulnerable Americans."
&lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11949746/the-irs-is-building-its-own-online-tax-filing-system-tax-prep-companies-arent-happy"&gt;https://www.kqed.org/news/11949746/the-irs-is-building-its-own-online-tax-filing-system-tax-prep-companies-arent-happy&lt;/a&gt;
Despite Upton Sinclair's advice that "it is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it," I will now attempt to try to explain to Heineman why he is unfuckingbelievably, eye-wateringly wrong.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"e-file...is wholly redundant": Well, no, Rick, it's not redundant, because there is no existing Free File system except for the one your corrupt employer made and hid "in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"nothing more than a solution in search of a problem": The problem this solves is that Americans have to pay Intuit billions to pay their taxes. It's a tax on paying taxes. That is a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"unnecessarily cost taxpayers billions of dollars": No, it will &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt; taxpayers the billions of dollars (they pay you).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"harm the most vulnerable Americans": Here is an area where Heineman can speak with authority, because few companies have more experience harming vulnerable Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the Child Tax Credit. This is the most successful social program in living memory, a single initiative that did more to lift American children out of poverty than any other since the days of the Great Society. It turns out that giving poor people money makes them less poor, which is weird, because neoliberal economists have spent decades assuring us that this is not the case:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/16/mortgages-are-rent-control/#housing-is-a-human-right-not-an-asset"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/16/mortgages-are-rent-control/#housing-is-a-human-right-not-an-asset&lt;/a&gt;
But the Child Tax Credit has been systematically sabotaged, by Intuit lobbyists, who successfully added layer after layer of red tape - needless complexity that makes it nearly impossible to claim the credit without expert help - from the likes of Intuit:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/29/three-times-is-enemy-action/#ctc"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/29/three-times-is-enemy-action/#ctc&lt;/a&gt;
It worked. As Ryan Cooper writes in &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;: "between 13 and 22 percent of EITC benefits are gulped down by tax prep companies":
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-05-17-irs-takes-welcome-step-20th-century/"&gt;https://prospect.org/economy/2023-05-17-irs-takes-welcome-step-20th-century/&lt;/a&gt;
So yes, I will defer to Rick Heineman and his employer Intuit on the subject of "harming the most vulnerable Americans." After all, they're the experts. National champions, even.
Now I want to address the reply guys who are vibrating with excitement to tell me about their 1099 income, the cash money they get from their lemonade stand, the weird flow of krugerrands their relatives in South African FedEx to them twice a year, etc, that means that free file won't work for them because the IRS doesn't actually understand their finances.
That's a hard problem, all right. Luckily, there is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; simple answer for this: use a tax-prep service.
Actually, it's not a hard problem. Just use a tax-prep service. That's it. No one is going to &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; you to use the IRS's free e-file. All you need to do to avoid the socialist nightmare of (checks notes) &lt;em&gt;living with less red-tape&lt;/em&gt; is: &lt;em&gt;continue to do exactly what you're already doing&lt;/em&gt;.
Same goes for those of you who have a beloved family accountant you've used since the Eisenhower administration. All you need to do to continue to enjoy the advice of that trusted advisor is...nothing. That's it. Simply &lt;em&gt;don't change anything&lt;/em&gt;.
One final note, addressing the people who are worried that the IRS will cheat innocent taxpayers by not giving them all the benefits they're entitled to. Allow me here to simply tap the sign that says "between 13 and 22 percent of EITC benefits are gulped down by tax prep companies." In other words, when you fret about taxpayers being ripped off, you're thinking of Intuit, not the IRS. Just calm down. Why not try using fluoridated toothpaste? You'll feel better, and I promise I won't tell your friends at the Gadsen Flag appreciation society.
Your secret is safe with me.

&lt;h1&gt;Debts that can't be paid, won't be paid (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/29/jubilance/#debt"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
It's been just over a year since the death of activist, writer and anthropologist David Graeber - a brilliant speaker, writer and thinker who helped give us Occupy, "we are the 99%" and "Bullshit Jobs."
On the anniversary of David's death, his widow Nika Dubrovsky convened the first "Art Project" discussion, a fascinating debate between Thomas Piketty and Michael Hudson, a pair of political economists whose work is neatly bridged by Graeber's own.
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWT0uvBLDbo"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWT0uvBLDbo&lt;/a&gt;
Piketty, of course, is the bestselling French economist whose 2013 Capital in the 21st Century was an unlikely, 700+ page viral hit, describing with rare lucidity the macroeconomics that drive capitalism towards cruel and destabilizing inequality
&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2014/06/24/thomas-pikettys-capital-in-the-21st-century/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2014/06/24/thomas-pikettys-capital-in-the-21st-century/&lt;/a&gt;
Hudson, meanwhile, is the debt-historian and economist whose haunting phrase "Debts that can't be paid, won't be paid," is a perfect and irrefutable summation of the inevitable downfall of any system that relies on household debt to drive consumption.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#jubilee"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#jubilee&lt;/a&gt;
Like Hudson, Graeber was obsessed with the history and politics of debt. His 2012 book "Debt: The First 5,000 years" influenced not just Piketty's work, but the work of many non-economists, including a large group of science fiction writers.
&lt;a href="https://www.tor.com/2012/04/16/the-best-science-fiction-ideas-in-any-non-fiction-ever-david-graebers-debt-the-first-five-thousand-years/"&gt;https://www.tor.com/2012/04/16/the-best-science-fiction-ideas-in-any-non-fiction-ever-david-graebers-debt-the-first-five-thousand-years/&lt;/a&gt;
Like Piketty, Graeber was capable of writing extremely long books that were so engaging that people actually &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; them, absorbing complex and nuanced subjects.  DEBT clocked in at 534 pages, and not a dud among them.
And like both Hudson and Piketty, Graeber was obsessed with long timescales and the ways that history is pressed into service to assert that various political situations are inevitable products of human nature, meaning that there's no point in asking for a fairer system.
In Debt, Graeber reaches back 5,000 years to question (among other things), the "money story" that money was created by individuals who wanted to make barter more efficient, settling on coins as a way to make change for someone who wants a cow but only has chickens to trade.
Graeber shows the "confluence of needs" theory of money to be a fairy tale, something that orthodox economists literally made up as the "most likely" source of money, without ever asking historians about what the record tells us about the origins of money.
Which is a pity, because historians know a lot about this stuff! For example, they can tell you about the Babylonian use of ledgers to record the issuance and redemption of debt in the largely agricultural economy of the day.
This early money would be recognizable to farmers today: during planting season, a share of the eventual harvest is promised in exchange for the inputs needed to plant, nurture and reap the crops.
Like Graeber, Hudson also treats Babylonian policy as key to economics - specifically, the Babylonian understanding that "debts that can't be paid, won't be paid," which is why the state would periodically declare a jubilee in which all debts were declared void.
Without these periodic jubilees, the entire productive economy is swallowed up by debt service - every poor harvest or other unforseeable circumstance drives producers (who are also debtors) further into debt, whose interest creates an inescapable gravity.
Without some way to escape debt's gravity, all productive labor becomes oriented toward debt-service, and the economy grinds to a halt. If this sounds familiar, you're probably paying attention to today's political economy:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation&lt;/a&gt;
Piketty also works in long timescales, though his historical analysis is an order of magnitude more recent that Hudston or Graeber's. At Capital XXI's core is a data-set, painstakingly assembled by Piketty and his grad students over more than a decade.
That data-set traces "capital flows" (the distribution of wealth and income) for 300+ years, rigorously traced and normalized, so that we can understand things like the relative degree of inequality in different societies over centuries.
Famously, Piketty concludes that no matter how fast an economy is growing - no matter how productive its makers are - that wealth grows faster, making the takers who financed growth even richer than the people whose work is propelling the economy.
This fundamental truth (expressed in economic notation as r &amp;gt; g, or "return on capital is greater than economic growth") means that "meritocracy" is a lie: the richest people in a market economy aren't the people who do the best work, it's the people who started off rich.
Like Hudson, Piketty's work looks at the relationship between inequality and instability: Piketty uses his data to show that inequality crises trigger political crises, and that high degrees of inequality precede upheavals like the French Revolution and the World Wars.
Given all that, a discussion between Piketty and Hudson, convened in Graeber's memory, is bound to be fascinating, and they don't disappoint (if you prefer text to video, check out Naked Capitalism's transcript):
&lt;a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/09/michael-hudson-and-thomas-piketty-debate-inequality-debt-and-reform.html"&gt;https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/09/michael-hudson-and-thomas-piketty-debate-inequality-debt-and-reform.html&lt;/a&gt;
Here's my highlight reel of the discussion, with commentary. Hudson opens with a skeptical take on Piketty's conclusion to Capital XXI, in which he proposes a global wealth tax. Such a tax is nearly impossible to enforce, says Hudson - unlike a jubilee.
Hudson says the source of today's global vast fortunes is not earnings or income - rather, it's central banks' subsidy of the value of stocks and bonds, through rock-bottom interest rates, bond guarantees, etc. These fuel speculative bear markets that run up asset prices.
These state-subsidized fortunes are pumped into the financial markets, becoming the loans that everyone else has to pay debt on, just to survive. As in ancient times, the finance sector eventually swallows the productive economy whole. Without jubilee, you get collapse.
This is true within rich economies, but it's even more pronounced in the relations between poor debtor countries who were coerced into taking on massive debts by the IMF, who are going to pay an ever-larger share of their GDP to offshore creditors as the economy slows.
The only way for poor countries to service those debts is by imposing crushing austerity, which means starving domestic producers of investment, education and health services, reducing productivity, requiring more austerity - until the whole thing collapses.
Remember: debts that can't be paid, won't be paid. It's an iron law, and cannot be repealed - not by austerity, not by "better management," not by "living within your means." Can't be paid = won't be paid.
Piketty doesn't dispute any of this, saying that he's reconsidered some of the solutions in Capital XXI in light of subsequent events, like the pathetically inadequate global minimum corporate tax of 15%, which only rich countries' treasuries will get to participate in.
Piketty points to his followup to Capital XXI, the even weightier (and sadly less influential) Capital and Ideology for his more up-to-date thinking on the way to address inequality and instability.
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/19/capital-and-ideology-by-thomas-piketty-review-if-inequality-is-illegitimate-why-not-reduce-it"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/19/capital-and-ideology-by-thomas-piketty-review-if-inequality-is-illegitimate-why-not-reduce-it&lt;/a&gt;
He reiterates his thesis that inequality self-corrects, thanks to the instability it engenders. Left on their own, market economies collapse, torn apart by the bill  for guards to defend lenders' fortunes, the bill for interest payments that enrich lenders.
Impose sufficient austerity and brutality on a society and the cost of defending it exceeds the wealth its productive sector manages to produce, and boom - French Revolution, the World Wars, etc.
Piketty proposes that mounting "catastrophic climate change" might precipitate the next crisis, which is certainly a safe bet, though of course, the question is whether that crisis will come after the point of no return for a habitable planet.
Hudson has ideas about how we might hasten transformative change without risking civilizational collapse. He points out that Piketty's work identifies inherited wealth as inequality's wellspring and points out that estate taxes are much more enforceable than wealth taxes.
Certainly, inherited wealth is a live issue today. The latest installment of Propublica's essential IRS Papers reporting shows how the richest Americans abuse a bizarre loophole to avoid ANY tax on indescribably vast estates:
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/more-than-half-of-americas-100-richest-people-exploit-special-trusts-to-avoid-estate-taxes"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/more-than-half-of-americas-100-richest-people-exploit-special-trusts-to-avoid-estate-taxes&lt;/a&gt;
No one knows exactly how much tax avoidance  grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) drive, because they are shrouded in secrecy. In 2013, the lawyer who created GRATs said they'd allowed the ultra-wealthy to evade $100b in taxes. Their use has increased since then.
Another lever for reducing inequality is political competition. Hudson points out that during the Cold War, capitalist states took steps to prevent runaway inequality in a bid to show that market economies were more stable than centralized, planned economies.
Hudson suggests that competition with China might serve that function today. Without forgiving China for its autocracy and human rights abuses, he gives favorable marks to its economic planners for reining in the finance sector.
It's true that China intervened heavily in credit markets during the covid crisis, to prevent rentiers from destroying productive businesses that couldn't service their debts during lockdown, preserving larges swathes of otherwise vulnerable productive firms.
He reminds us that the original meaning of "free market" was "a market free from rents," where unproductive creditors were not allowed to lay a private tax on productive manufacturers.
&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/03/cory-doctorow-free-markets/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2021/03/cory-doctorow-free-markets/&lt;/a&gt;
Today, the meaning has been reversed - a market is "free" if creditors face no limits on rent-extraction.
But there's good reason to be skeptical of claims that China's economy is being well-managed, as Anne Stevenson-Yang writes.
&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/annestevenson-yang/2021/09/25/chairman-xi-chinas-looming-crisis-and-the-myth-of-infallibility/"&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/annestevenson-yang/2021/09/25/chairman-xi-chinas-looming-crisis-and-the-myth-of-infallibility/&lt;/a&gt;
Stevenson-Yang paints a picture of chaotic state management of the Chinese economy, hidden by state-owned media and its rosy outlook. Watchwords like "common prosperity" are empty buzzwords, used to paper over self-interested, corrupt business practices.
State initiatives measure progress through short-term, easily gamed KPIs, something she says is documented in Red Roulette: "a new book written by a disaffected property developer named Desmond Shum."
&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Red-Roulette/Desmond-Shum/9781982156152"&gt;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Red-Roulette/Desmond-Shum/9781982156152&lt;/a&gt;
Now, I'm willing to stipulate that for investors and property developers "corruption" or "incompetence" might be indistinguishable from what the rest of us would call good governance, but some of Stevenson-Yang's charges seem factual and well-made.
I found the discussion between Piketty and Hudson fascinating, and if there was anything more that I'd add, it would be a dose of technopolitics (unsurprisingly). After all, technology has a huge bearing on the timing and nature of the shifts that both economists study.
For Piketty, inequality-driven instability collapses when the cost of guard-labor rises too high to bear - other words, eventually, a society gets so unequal that it costs more to stave off guillotines than even the ultrarich can afford.
For Hudson, debt-driven instability collapses when debtors begin to default because they have no ability to service their debts.
Technology changes the nature of both of these collapses.
Take guard labor: mass surveillance and technological controls make it cheaper than at any time in history to isolate and neutralize political threats to elite rule.
How much cheaper? Well, in 1989, the Stasi employed one in sixty East Germans to spy on the whole nation.
Today, the NSA spies on the whole &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;, at a spy:subject ratio that's more like 1:10,000 - two orders of magnitude more efficient than the spies of a generation ago. That's a huge productivity gain, and it's all thanks to digital technology.
When it comes to debtor default, the tension is between coercion and ability to pay. Yes, "debts that can't be paid, won't be paid," but "can't be paid" is not a hard limit - it turns on how much the debtor is willing to hurt themselves and their loved ones to make payments.
Every mafia armbreaker knows this. When someone can't pay their debts, you can break their arm and they'll cash in their kids' college fund and secretly remortgage their house to make the next payment.
When that runs out, if you threaten to break their legs, the debtor will start breaking into cars. Eventually, this comes to an end, when the debtor goes to prison for 25 years. But in the meantime, coercive force can wring a fair amount of blood from the stone.
Debtor coercion has been transformed by digital technology, from an artisanal, retail handicraft to a scaled up, industrial practice.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/02/innovation-unlocks-markets/#digital-arm-breakers"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/02/innovation-unlocks-markets/#digital-arm-breakers&lt;/a&gt;
We don't need the threat of repo men to keep you paying your car note - miss a Tesla payment and your car will phone home and lock its doors. When the tow arrives, it will flash its lights, honk its horn and back out of its parking space for repossession.
The ability to digitally repossess, or partially repossess (as in India, where loan-shark cellphone companies disable your most-used apps if you miss a payment) the tools you rely on for life and livelihood makes it cost-effective to apply coercion at scale.
Cheap guard-labor and cheap coercion mean that crisis can be deferred for ever-longer timescales. Thus, societies run up the only kind of debt that really matters: policy debt. Lives are ruined, productive capacity tanked, the planet poisoned.
Add tech to Piketty or Hudson's analysis and things start to look a lot less self-correcting, and the odds tilt against our civilization, our species and our planet. If a correction only comes after the point of no return, we're in very deep shit indeed.

&lt;h1&gt;"Are you calling me a racist?" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/29/jubilance/#tolerable-racism"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In "I Can't Breathe," Matt Taibbi's book on Eric Garner's murder he writes, "You could reduce...Fox News and afternoon talk radio to a morbid national obsession that could be summarized on a t-shirt: ‘Are you calling me a racist?'"
&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2017/12/15/i-cant-breathe-matt-taibbis-scorching-book-on-the-murder-of-eric-garner-and-the-system-that-let-the-killers-get-away-with-it/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2017/12/15/i-cant-breathe-matt-taibbis-scorching-book-on-the-murder-of-eric-garner-and-the-system-that-let-the-killers-get-away-with-it/&lt;/a&gt;
It's a passage I found myself turning to regularly during the Trump years, when right wing figures bristled at being called racist merely for supporting an explicitly racist party that took power by appealing to white nationalism.
The media spent a lot of that period asking itself whether being a Republican was the same as being a racist, and one commonsense answer that cropped up a lot was, "It may not mean that you are racist, but it does mean that you'll accept racism as the price of GOP rule."
I was reminded of this by the current episode of Backbench, Canadaland's national politics podcast. This week, host Fatima Syed interviews a listener who sent an angry email to the show after hearing voters for the People's Party of Canada called "racist."
&lt;a href="https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/14-a-conversation-with-a-ppc-voter/"&gt;https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/14-a-conversation-with-a-ppc-voter/&lt;/a&gt;
The caller was angry because he was not a racist: he's a "libertarian" who wants low taxes. At the start of the interview, he insists that the manifestly racist People's Party is not racist.
But as Syed points out the explicit racism in its platform its extensive ties to avowed neo-Nazis, the caller's position gradually shifts - from denying racism to describing racism as a universal factor in all parties.
Finally, he acknowledges the party's racist ties but excuses them as the price of low taxes - "You gotta take the good with the bad."
Interestingly, the caller was able to speak intelligently about the nature of systemic racism and identify it as a serious problem.
He just doesn't think it's as big a problem as high taxes.
This is what we mean when we talk about saying the quiet part out loud.
Of all the brain-worms that prey upon the conservative mind, none are quite so powerful as the "no tax" pathology.
After all, clowns like Doug and Rob Ford were not solely elected by people who were swayed by promises of $1 beers and a ban on teaching butt stuff in sex ed - the Fords' constituency includes millions who'd vote for a dead squirrel if it would knock $0.25 off their taxes.
Likewise, many wealthy Texan GOP donors are going to continue to procure abortions for themselves, their spouses and their kids. They're likely horrified by the state's new forced childbirth law. It's not that they don't believe in abortion rights.
Rather, it's that a $1 discount on their tax bill is worth more to them than the suffering of every person who endures a forced birth, and every child produced by those births. No-tax brain worms are a hell of a drug.
Libertarianism is notionally grounded in the idea of self-determination and personal responsibility, but in practice, powerful libertarians routinely trade off (others') freedom for (their own) tax savings.
Sure, the Kochs donate a lot of money to fighting private prisons - but it's eclipsed by their campaign contributions and dark money for GOP candidates who support private prisons. They sincerely oppose private prisons, but not as much as they support low taxes.
It was ever thus. Von Hayek and Friedman - those great defenders of freedom! - endorsed and gave material aid to Pinochet's military dictatorship, as it butchered 40,000 of its opponents, leaving their body parts in roadside trash-bags or pushing them out of helicopters.
There's nothing "libertarian" about a military dictatorship, but the Chicago Boys were all about low taxation. Indeed, Friedman never met a form of oppression he wouldn't trade for lower taxes.
Take school segregation: as Nancy MacLean writes, Milton Friedman saw racist fury at school integration as an opportunity to draw supporters to his plan to end public education (thus lowering taxes):
&lt;a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-milton-friedman-aided-and-abetted-segregationists-in-his-quest-to-privatize-public-education"&gt;https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-milton-friedman-aided-and-abetted-segregationists-in-his-quest-to-privatize-public-education&lt;/a&gt;
Friedman helped start the Charter School movement as a way for white parents to get public money to send their kids to private, whites-only schools, after the Supreme Court and Congress ended public school segregation.
I have no idea if Friedman was racist. I don't even care. It doesn't matter if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; racism because you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; racist, or because you have anti-tax brain-worms that make you throw in your lot with violent, racist would-be genociders. Being "pro-genocide" is incompatible with being "pro-liberty."
In contemplating rightist thought, I have three definitions. The first is Steven Brust's (quoted in my novel Walkaway): "Ask what's more important, human rights or property rights. If they say 'property rights ARE human rights' they're on the right."
&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/"&gt;https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/&lt;/a&gt;
The second is Corey Robin's, from The Reactionary Mind: Some people (bosses, white people, Americans, men) are born to rule, and others (racialized people, women, workers, foreigners) to be ruled over. We thrive when natural rulers are in charge.
&lt;a href="https://coreyrobin.com/the-reactionary-mind/"&gt;https://coreyrobin.com/the-reactionary-mind/&lt;/a&gt;
The third is Frank Wilhot's: "Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect."
&lt;a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/"&gt;https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/&lt;/a&gt;
The willingness to trade other peoples' fundamental rights for preferential tax treatment fits neatly into all three of these, as does the delusion that somehow this can be resolved with sufficient "personal responsibility."

&lt;img alt="The Wells Fargo logo, with a superimposed sillhouette of a guillotine." src="https://craphound.com/images/1200px-Wells_Fargo_Bank.svg_.png-1-2.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wells Fargo can't stop criming (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/29/jubilance/#too-big-to-jail"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Wells Fargo is America's third-largest bank. It used to be the largest, but it committed a string of terrible frauds that it was never truly punished for (it made more from crime than it paid in fines).
Its crime spree &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; result in one meaningful punishment: Wells was forced to downsize to #3, with a mere $1.77 trillion in assets.
Have no fear: Wells Fargo is down but not out, and despite its reduced stature, it is still engaged in egregious acts of fraud.
The latest scam? "Forex transposition." Say you have an account with Wells where you get income in euros but need to spend dollars. Historically, Wells would have defrauded you with "Range of Day" pricing.
That's where Wells converts your euros to dollars using the best rate (for Wells, AKA the worst rate for you), on the day you ordered the currency conversion. Currency prices move around a lot during the day, and this scam could easily double Wells' commission.
But the Range of Day scam is a grift for the little people, not suited to kings of con like Wells Fargo.
Wells just paid $76m to settle a federal investigation into a much more ambitious and brazen scam.
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-28/wells-fargo-swapped-some-digits"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-28/wells-fargo-swapped-some-digits&lt;/a&gt;
As Matt Levine writes for Bloomberg, the new scam involved simply "making up prices," while maintaining plausible deniability.
Here's how that worked: say the best Range of Day exchange rate (an already crooked number) was 1.0241. Wells Fargo's forex trader would exchange your funds at 1.0421. On big trades, that could cost you hundreds of thousands - even millions of dollars.
But you were unlikely to catch the error, and if you did, Wells's trader would just apologize and say that they transposed the digits accidentally.
As crimes go, this is pretty unambiguous. It's fraud. It made them a lot of money, and they only had to give some of it back.
That means they'll do it again.
Of course they will! This is Wells fuckin' Fargo, we're talking about. They &lt;em&gt;cannot stop criming&lt;/em&gt;.
In case you've forgotten about Wells's crime-spree (it's been a minute), here's some highlights:
During foreclosure bonanza of the Great Financial Crisis, Wells led the pack. They literally broke into peoples' homes, stole all their worldly goods and changed the locks, all without bothering to check whether they had the right house.
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/08/28/wells-fargo-contractors-stole-family-heirlooms/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2015/08/28/wells-fargo-contractors-stole-family-heirlooms/&lt;/a&gt;
Around then, Wells began to pressure its low-waged, young, precarious tellers to meet quotas on new accounts opened by existing customers. Its managers taught tellers how to fraudulently open these accounts. 2,000,000 customers were affected.
&lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-know-if-you-were-harmed-wells-fargo/"&gt;https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-know-if-you-were-harmed-wells-fargo/&lt;/a&gt;
These new accounts racked up millions in fees and penalties. Victims' credit scores were tanked, costing them mortgages, access to student loans, and jobs. The executive who ran the program was given a $125m bonus.
&lt;a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/09/wells-fargo-ceos-teflon-don-act-backfires-at-senate-hearing-i-take-full-responsibility-means-anything-but.html"&gt;https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/09/wells-fargo-ceos-teflon-don-act-backfires-at-senate-hearing-i-take-full-responsibility-means-anything-but.html&lt;/a&gt;
The CEO - who took a $200m bonus himself - blamed low-level employees for the crimes. What he didn't say was that low-level employees who blew the whistle on the scam were illegally fired.
&lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/09/21/investing/wells-fargo-fired-workers-retaliation-fake-accounts/index.html"&gt;https://money.cnn.com/2016/09/21/investing/wells-fargo-fired-workers-retaliation-fake-accounts/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
They fired a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of whistleblowers.
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-09-22/whistle-blowers-and-good-activists"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-09-22/whistle-blowers-and-good-activists&lt;/a&gt;
They didn't just fire kids for blowing the whistle - they ruined them. After Wells fired a whistleblower, they'd add them to an industry database of bankers who'd been fired for doing crimes - people on that list can never work in the industry again.
&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/26/495454165/ex-wells-fargo-employees-sue-allege-they-were-punished-for-not-breaking-law"&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/26/495454165/ex-wells-fargo-employees-sue-allege-they-were-punished-for-not-breaking-law&lt;/a&gt;
Eventually, John Stumpf, the CEO who oversaw the crimes, resigned. The Wells board appointed a successor who insisted that the bank had no problems with its culture.
&lt;a href="https://consumerist.com/2016/10/13/new-wells-fargo-ceo-recently-denied-overbearing-sales-culture-that-created-fake-account-fiasco/"&gt;https://consumerist.com/2016/10/13/new-wells-fargo-ceo-recently-denied-overbearing-sales-culture-that-created-fake-account-fiasco/&lt;/a&gt;
Naturally, some customers who'd been stolen from sued. Wells asked a judge to throw out the case, because those customers signed away their right to sue when a Wells Fargo employee forged their signature on the paperwork to open a fraudulent account.
&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-accounts-lawsuit-idUSKBN13J1WX"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-accounts-lawsuit-idUSKBN13J1WX&lt;/a&gt;
The judge agreed.
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/business/dealbook/wells-fargo-killing-sham-account-suits-by-using-arbitration.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/business/dealbook/wells-fargo-killing-sham-account-suits-by-using-arbitration.html&lt;/a&gt;
Trump also liked Wells Fargo (he owed them a lot of money). Shortly after he took office, the Department of Labor's site for Wells whistleblowers vanished.
&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2017/01/27/whistleblower-site-for-wells-fargo-workers-vanishes/"&gt;https://nypost.com/2017/01/27/whistleblower-site-for-wells-fargo-workers-vanishes/&lt;/a&gt;
Wells Fargo's got great timing. During the Trump years, so many of its scandals came to light - and were never seriously punished by Trump's DOJ or regulators.
They stole millions with fraudulent "home warranties":
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/08/12/theres-a-new-wells-fargo-scandal-this-time-its-the-trucoat/"&gt;https://theintercept.com/2017/08/12/theres-a-new-wells-fargo-scandal-this-time-its-the-trucoat/&lt;/a&gt;
They stole millions by ripping off small businesses with fake credit-card fees:
&lt;a href="https://consumerist.com/2017/08/11/wells-fargo-accused-of-overcharging-small-businesses/"&gt;https://consumerist.com/2017/08/11/wells-fargo-accused-of-overcharging-small-businesses/&lt;/a&gt;
They defrauded 800,000 car insurance customers and stole ("improperly repossessed") 25,000 cars:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/business/wells-fargo-unwanted-auto-insurance.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/business/wells-fargo-unwanted-auto-insurance.html&lt;/a&gt;
They tricked people who sought mortgage refinancing into scam packages that looked good at first, but led to waves of defaults and foreclosures:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/business/wells-fargo-loan-mortgage.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/business/wells-fargo-loan-mortgage.html&lt;/a&gt;
When Wells &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; admitted it ripped off 2m customers with fake accounts and offered to pay them back, it created an &lt;em&gt;opt-in&lt;/em&gt; repayment system, ensuring that most of its victims would never be made whole:
&lt;a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/02/wells-fargo-screws-customers-yet-now-failing-make-right-abuses-elizabeth-warren-demands-answers.html"&gt;https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/02/wells-fargo-screws-customers-yet-now-failing-make-right-abuses-elizabeth-warren-demands-answers.html&lt;/a&gt;
The Trump tax cuts only emboldened the company: after having its taxes slashed, Wells cut 26,500 jobs, shuttered branches across the country, and firehosed money over its shareholders with a &lt;em&gt;$40.6 billion&lt;/em&gt; buyback.
&lt;a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/2018/11/07/what-wells-fargos-40-6-billion-in-stock-buybacks-could-have-meant-for-its-employees-and-customers/"&gt;https://rooseveltinstitute.org/2018/11/07/what-wells-fargos-40-6-billion-in-stock-buybacks-could-have-meant-for-its-employees-and-customers/&lt;/a&gt;
Not all the shareholders were satisfied. Some of them sued because the company had not delivered on its promises to "restore trust" in the bank. The company's defense? "Everyone knows we're liars, so they shouldn't have relied on our statements."
&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-wells-puffery-20181109-story.html"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-wells-puffery-20181109-story.html&lt;/a&gt;
I mean, they have a point. It was only months later when the company blamed a "computer glitch" for its theft of 525 homes from people who should not have faced foreclosure.
&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wells-fargo-loan-modification-error-homeowners-who-went-into-foreclosure-seek-answers/"&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wells-fargo-loan-modification-error-homeowners-who-went-into-foreclosure-seek-answers/&lt;/a&gt;
There's no such thing as a non-sociopathic giant bank, but even in the crowded field of crime-addicted financial firms, Wells Fargo stands out. The fact that they've paid $76m - instead of having their execs go to prison - means they'll do it again.
And again.
And again.

&lt;h1&gt;Canadian telco monopolists run the show (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/01/you-are-here/#crtc"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
If there's one lesson you'd hope governments would take away from the pandemic and the lockdown, it's that good internet policy - universal access at fair prices, managed in the public interest - is a prerequisite for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; good policy.
Canada didn't get the memo.
Last week, the CRTC - Canada's telecoms regulator - released its long-awaited decision on the wholesale prices paid by small, innovative ISPs to access the facilities of Canada's telecoms monopolists.
It's the worst such decision in history.
&lt;a href="https://blogs.teksavvy.com/the-liberal-government-must-fire-crtc-chair-ian-scott"&gt;https://blogs.teksavvy.com/the-liberal-government-must-fire-crtc-chair-ian-scott&lt;/a&gt;
Ian Scott (a former teleco lobbyist that Justin Trudeau's Liberals put in charge of the CRTC) shocked the nation by reversing the Commission's own policy, dramatically raising wholesale prices, signing a death-warrant for Canada's entire independent ISP sector.
The decision means hundreds of millions of dollars in windfall profits for the Big Three Canadian telco monopolists, and ends ambitious plans by Canada's wonderful indie ISPs like Teksavvy to lay both rural and urban fiber.
Even worse: Scott has reversed the CRTC's order for the Big Three to refund millions in price-gouged overcharges to indie ISPs, despite a vast public record that indicates that this money was illegally extracted.
It's the latest in a string of terrible internet policy decisions from Scott's CRTC, including a rule that indie telcos that bid on wireless spectrum must also strike deals with the Big Three monopolists, guaranteeing that such efforts will lose money and fail.
Ian Scott is a dingo babysitter, a fox in the henhouse, a gator in the swamp. Teksavvy is calling on the Liberals to #FireIanScott.
According to the Toronto Star, the Liberal government isn't happy with Scott's decision, but it's hard to imagine them taking action on this issue, given the Liberals' idiotic internet regulation attempts.
&lt;a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/analysis/2021/05/29/in-the-end-bell-always-wins-why-did-the-crtc-backtrack-on-its-bid-to-lower-wholesale-internet-rates.html"&gt;https://www.thestar.com/business/analysis/2021/05/29/in-the-end-bell-always-wins-why-did-the-crtc-backtrack-on-its-bid-to-lower-wholesale-internet-rates.html&lt;/a&gt;
Trudeau will be remembered as the first Liberal PM to be stupider about the internet than the Tories. After all, his first broken election promise was the repeal of Bill C-51, the Tories' mass surveillance act, which he whipped his caucus to vote for.
&lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/12/citizen-lab-and-cippic-release-analysis-of-the-communications-security-establishment-act/"&gt;https://citizenlab.ca/2017/12/citizen-lab-and-cippic-release-analysis-of-the-communications-security-establishment-act/&lt;/a&gt;
Today, the Liberals are pushing hard for Bill C-10,  an internet censorship bill that has far-reaching implications for everything from podcasts to blog posts, despite government misinformation to the contrary.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/27/8-hours-for-what-we-will/#c-10"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/27/8-hours-for-what-we-will/#c-10&lt;/a&gt;
The Trudeau reality-distortion-field is in full effect with Bill C-10, with Liberal spin-doctors having convinced Canadians that opposition to Bill C-10 comes from Tory simps who've been conned about the true extent of the bill.
But C-10 really does reach into every aspect of Canadians' online lives, and will empower future government appointees to inflict harms even greater than the damage Ian Scott is dealing to the nation's digital future.
Worse, the NDP and Bloc Quebecois have joined with with the Liberals in supporting this bill, refusing to back amendments that would have repaired many of the serious defects in the language.
&lt;a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/06/liberals-ndp-and-bloc-vote-down-user-generated-content-safeguards-as-mps-defend-deeply-flawed-bill-c-10-committee-study/"&gt;https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/06/liberals-ndp-and-bloc-vote-down-user-generated-content-safeguards-as-mps-defend-deeply-flawed-bill-c-10-committee-study/&lt;/a&gt;
Assuming that anything the Tories want to do to the internet is fucking awful is a pretty good rule of thumb, but not this time. Not only are they right about the potential harms of C-10, but they're also poised to weaponise it after their next election win.
After all, as bad as schmucks like Ian Scott are, Tory appointees are even worse: just imagine how PM Doug Ford (or worse, PM Faith Goldy) would use these censorship powers.

&lt;h1&gt;Google cheats on location privacy (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/01/you-are-here/#goog"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Arizona AG Mark Brnovich is suing Google for lying to its users about location privacy, tracking them even after they opted out. A newly released set of unredacted Google records are explosive evidence of the company's deception.
&lt;a href="https://www.azag.gov/media/interest/updated-redacted-google-complaint"&gt;https://www.azag.gov/media/interest/updated-redacted-google-complaint&lt;/a&gt;
The documents show that Google deliberately engineered its products so that you couldn't get your own location, or share it with an app, without also giving your location data to Google, too.
&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unredacted-google-lawsuit-docs-detail-efforts-to-collect-user-location-2021-5"&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/unredacted-google-lawsuit-docs-detail-efforts-to-collect-user-location-2021-5&lt;/a&gt;
They reveal a system so deliberately tangled that even senior Google product managers &lt;em&gt;who worked on location systems&lt;/em&gt; didn't understand how they worked.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1398359580275523590"&gt;https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1398359580275523590&lt;/a&gt;
They also reveal internal message board conversations between Googlers who were outraged to learn how hard it was to disable location tracking.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1398359265807581189"&gt;https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1398359265807581189&lt;/a&gt;
A thread by Jason Kint of Digital Content Next gives chapter and verse on the revelations from the document drop:
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1398353211220807682"&gt;https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1398353211220807682&lt;/a&gt;
What I found particularly striking, though, was the history of location privacy in Google's settings. At one point, the company made it easy to turn off location tracking, and then was aghast when users disabled tracking in &lt;em&gt;droves&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;img alt="A chart showing the location tracking opt-outs after Google made it easy to disable location tracking in 2017." src="https://craphound.com/images/E2f1tSEWYAAVHGY.jpeg"/&gt;
This is surprising given how strong the power of defaults is: most users never change any settings. The fact that users disabled location tracking widely and immediately speaks volumes about how much people value location privacy.
But despite this "revealed preference" (to use econo-jargon), Google's response wasn't to turn location tracking off by default - rather, it responded by using dark patterns to turn tracking back on and make it nearly impossible to disable again.
The location tracking opt-outs were smeared out across multiple sets of preference screens, and the company leaned hard on its mobile device partners to follow suit. The names of the manufacturers who caved are still redacted in the docs, except for LG.
This is a prime example of consent theater: the company asks you for your consent to creepily follow you 24/7. You say no, so it asks again, in such a convoluted way that you don't even realize you've said yes. Talk about "manufacturing consent."
&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/consent-theater-a32b98cd8d96"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/consent-theater-a32b98cd8d96&lt;/a&gt;
It's worth asking why Google was so thirsty for our location. The company will claim that it's because location tracking improves search results, which is doubtless true; location data lets them give good results for "pizza" instead of making you search for "pizza nyc."
But that's not the main event from a business perspective. As the UK Competition and Markets Authority Report on ad-tech made clear, Facebook and Google have monopolized the ad market by offering "attribution."
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study"&gt;https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study&lt;/a&gt;
What's "attribution?" It's when a company shows you an ad and then tracks every click you make, every location you visit and every purchase you make (merging data from payment processors) to prove to advertisers that you bought something after seeing an ad for it.
Attribution solves the age-old advertising problem, famously articulated by the department store mogul John Wanamaker: "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half."
That may be great news for advertisers, but who gives a shit? The fact that advertisers' lives are made easier if I let them follow me around 24/7 forever to see if their ads worked is &lt;em&gt;not my problem&lt;/em&gt;.
I mean, advertisers' lives would be easier if, instead of showing you an ad, they could reach inside your bank-account, withdraw some of your money, and send you a product because they think you need it. We'd be idiots to let them, though.
Advertisers are willing to pay &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; premiums for attribution tracking (despite the fact that, as with the entire ad-tech stack, attribution data is full of Big Tech frauds that make advertising look far more effective than it ever is or will be).
That's why Google was so desperate to keep location turned on - why it was willing to commit outright fraud and to bully its partners into following suit.
One of the major promises of a Google antitrust breakup is the possibility of ending attribution. Unfortunately, that's not what many competition regulators view as the "solution to "the attribution problem."
Indeed, the CMA's report sees the major attribution problem as being a lack of competition among attributors. Rather than allowing Facebook and Google to monopolize attribution, the CMA proposes to let everyone get in on the game.
This is not what we need from our competition policy. We don't want competition to see which companies can inflict the most human rights abuses at the lowest cost.

&lt;img alt="The first page of the DC antitrust suit against Amazon, superimposed with the Prime logo; a vintage newspaper caricature of Roosevelt as a club-swinging trustbuster is superimposed on the Prime wordmark so that he appears to be about to bat the dot off the 'i' in 'Prime.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/primepricefixing.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The antitrust case against Prime (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/01/you-are-here/#prime-facie"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The starting gun on Big Tech trustbusting was fired in 2017, when Lina Khan, then a law student (now an FTC trustbuster!) published "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," a law-review article showing how Amazon formed a monopoly without legal trouble.
&lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox&lt;/a&gt;
The key was a Reagan-era shift in antitrust policy, based on the theories of the Nixonite criminal Robert Bork. Bork held that the only time we should fight monopolies is when they inflicted "consumer welfare" harms, by driving up prices.
That meant that monopolies that made prices go &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; - by abusing their workers and suppliers, rather than their customers - were safe from antitrust enforcement. Borkism was hugely popular with wealthy people, who bankrolled its global expansion.
Every president since Reagan has embraced and furthered the "consumer welfare" doctrine, which meant that when Amazon tapped into the capital markets for billions, it was able to safely offer prices below their wholesale cost, using investor cash for subsidies.
Then, after it had extinguished all its competitors, it could end its subsidy and switch it to its suppliers - forcing them to cut their margins and wages to unsustainable levels to maintain those prices.
This was "Amazon's antitrust paradox": it could inflict vast monopoly harms on the economy but never face antitrust enforcement because it harmed workers and other businesses, not "consumers."
Now that the Big Tech trustbusting movement is in full swing, state attorneys general and the feds (DoJ and FTC) have brought antitrust actions against GAFAM, including multiple suits against Amazon.
One of the more interesting suits is DC Attorney General Karl Racine's cast against Amazon:
&lt;a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/Amazon-Complaint-.pdf"&gt;https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/Amazon-Complaint-.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
As Matt Stoller explains, the DC-Amazon case has a better chance of succeeding than any of the other antitrust actions brought so far, because it accuses Amazon of driving up prices.
&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/amazon-primes-free-shipping-promise"&gt;https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/amazon-primes-free-shipping-promise&lt;/a&gt;
To understand how that works, you need to understand the role Amazon Prime plays in the company's business. Jeff Bezos described Prime as "a moat around our best customers." Once you pay for fast, flat-rate delivery, you're powerfully incentivized to order from Amazon.
Locking customers into buying from Amazon locks businesses into selling on Amazon. That allows Amazon to structure its own market - and the markets of all other businesses.
For example, Amazon gives search preference to Prime-eligible items. Realistically, if you're an Amazon seller and you're not in the first screen or two of results, you will not make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sales.
(Incidentally, if you've ever seen those breakdowns of the ad-tech market that show Amazon making billions from ad-sales and wondered how that worked, it's not actual ad-sales revenue in the way that Google and Facebook get paid for ads)
(Those "ad-sale" billions are the fees Amazon charges its own sellers for search-results preference - to have a "sponsored product" show up in the results when you search on Amazon - it's not an "ad" - it's a "bribe")
If you want to be Prime eligible, you have to sign up for a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of conditions: you have to promise you won't sell more cheaply anywhere else, you have to let Amazon pack and ship your products, and you have to give up commissions of up to 45% on each sale.
To recap: Prime means you have to sell on Amazon because that's where everyone buys. To sell on Prime, you have to give Amazon 45% of the sale-price, and you can't sell more cheaply anywhere else.
What that means is that every merchant that wants to sell on Amazon (which is every merchant that wants to sell goods on the internet outside of China) has to charge 35-45% &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; for its products, and not just on Amazon, but &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.
The "free shipping" you get on Prime items is actually paid for by a one-third markup that everyone who buys anything on Amazon, or in &lt;em&gt;any other store&lt;/em&gt;, pays.
In other words, Amazon hasn't just used its monopoly power to raise prices on its own customers, but on &lt;em&gt;everyone's&lt;/em&gt; customers. And that is the &lt;em&gt;one thing&lt;/em&gt; that US antitrust law still vigorously punishes.

&lt;h1&gt;Dems want to give $600b to the one percent (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/28/inequality-r-us/#neotrumpism"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Remember when a group of establishment Congressional Democrats vowed that they would add means-testing to the emergency relief checks so that "the money wouldn't go to people who didn't need it?"
&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/biden-stimulus-checks-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/biden-stimulus-checks-what-you-need-to-know/&lt;/a&gt;
The argument that federal relief should target the 99% and not the 1% is a familiar - and defensible - one. The Trump #taxscam handed trillions to the richest Americans, triggering stock buybacks:
&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/23/business/investment-boom-tax-cuts-economy/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/23/business/investment-boom-tax-cuts-economy/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
and a superyacht bubble:
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/superyacht-marina-west-palm-beach-opportunity-zone-trump-tax-break-to-help-the-poor-went-to-a-rich-gop-donor"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/superyacht-marina-west-palm-beach-opportunity-zone-trump-tax-break-to-help-the-poor-went-to-a-rich-gop-donor&lt;/a&gt;
But it delivered no meaningful benefit to everyday Americans.
Now, that said, there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; one area of the Trump tax bill that targeted the wealthy: the State and Local Tax (SALT) Cap, which capped SALT deductions at $10,000.
That meant that taxpayers could only write off the first $10k of their state and local tax. In practice, this affected very wealthy Americans, predominantly those living in large, high-property-value cities, which has substantial overlap with rich Democratic donors.
That's the only reason for Trump's SALT Cap, and it's a stupid and spiteful reason: passing a tax that targets the wealthy because of partisanship is bad.
But taxing the wealthy is, in fact, good. Trump set out to do something bad and did something good, in other words.
Now, a group of Dems - many of the same Dems who held up the stimulus because they didn't want to send $1600 to the underserving wealthy - are holding the $2t infrastructure plan hostage and demanding that the SALT Cap be repealed.
And while they claim a SALT Cap repeal would benefit the middle class, it disproportionately and vastly benefits the ultra-rich: 86% of the benefit of the repeal would go to the top 5% of US earners.
&lt;a href="https://itep.org/salt-cap-repeal-has-no-place-in-covid-19-legislation-national-and-state-by-state-data/"&gt;https://itep.org/salt-cap-repeal-has-no-place-in-covid-19-legislation-national-and-state-by-state-data/&lt;/a&gt;
Under a SALT Cap repeal, households earning more than $1m/year getting $48k in extra cash:
Meanwhile, 98% of middle-class households with incomes of $50-75k would get &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. The 2% who got something would average &lt;em&gt;$250&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/salt-cap-repeal-would-overwhelmingly-benefit-high-income-households"&gt;https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/salt-cap-repeal-would-overwhelmingly-benefit-high-income-households&lt;/a&gt;
Lifting the SALT Cap is a powerfully regressive move. It is &lt;em&gt;three times more regressive&lt;/em&gt; than the Trump tax plan - that is 300% more tilted in favor of the wealthy.
&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/04/the-salt-tax-deduction-is-a-handout-to-the-rich-it-should-be-eliminated-not-expanded/"&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/04/the-salt-tax-deduction-is-a-handout-to-the-rich-it-should-be-eliminated-not-expanded/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="A bar chart entitled Share of Total Federal Tax Change that breaks out the proportional benefit of both a SALT Cap repeal and the Trump cuts by decile, showing decisively that a SALT CAP repeal is far more regressive than the Trump cuts." src="https://craphound.com/images/EzVyX9AVgAsb_r5.png"/&gt;
Lifting the SALT Cap has nothing to do with the middle class. For starters, the SALT deduction only applies to people who itemize expenses, rather than taking the standard deduction. 92% of the top 1% of earners do that (it's only 5% of the 40th-60th earning percentile).
It's possible that there are people in especially expensive cities in "blue states" for whom the SALT Cap is a burden - people at the lowest threshold of beneficiaries of a repeal who really are financially stretched.
If that's our concern, there's an easy, non-regressive fix - raise, but don't repeal, the cap. If $10k is too low, make it $15k, or even $20k. But by making the cap unlimited, we ensure that the wildly disproportionate beneficiaries of the change are the ultra-ultra-&lt;em&gt;ultra&lt;/em&gt; rich.
As David Sirota points out, this maneuver - claiming that a tax-break for the super-rich is really about the middle class - comes straight out of the GOP playbook. It's how Republicans sold cuts to the estate tax:
&lt;a href="https://www.dailyposter.com/p/dems-somehow-pretend-this-mostly"&gt;https://www.dailyposter.com/p/dems-somehow-pretend-this-mostly&lt;/a&gt;
That move - like the ones Dems are making now - made it much easier for the ultra-wealthy to make vast, tax-advantaged intergenerational wealth transfers, creating the rentier dynasties that now crouch on the political system's chest, sucking up all the oxygen.
Just to be clear: "there is no state where this is a primarily middle-class issue."
&lt;a href="https://itep.org/dems-dont-repeal-the-salt-cap-do-this-instead/"&gt;https://itep.org/dems-dont-repeal-the-salt-cap-do-this-instead/&lt;/a&gt;
The cuts will transfer $600b, primarily to the highest earners, over the next 9 years:
&lt;a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/repeal-10000-state-and-local-tax-salt-deduction-limitation-sep-2018/repeal-10000"&gt;https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/repeal-10000-state-and-local-tax-salt-deduction-limitation-sep-2018/repeal-10000&lt;/a&gt;
That's $600b worth of giveaways to the rich from the party that couldn't muster the political will to include a $15 minimum wage and that fretted endlessly about whether the $1400 stimulus (down from $2000) might go to someone in the middle class.
And while the "SALT Caucus" of Dems who are holding the infrastructure bill hostage to the super rich are a rogues' gallery of establishment, corporate Dems from high-tax states (Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, etc), the roster includes some otherwise progressive heroes.
Progressive Californian lawmakers like Ro Khanna and Katie Porter have both called on Biden to lift the cap entirely (though they've stopped short of promising to hold up the infrastructure bill), as have NY Democratic "insurgents" like Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones.
Some progressives, though, have kept the faith. Even as the entire NY Democratic caucus signed a letter calling for a SALT Cap repeal, AOC and Kathleen Rice refused.
&lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/04/28/key-democrats-want-to-keep-most-of-trumps-corporate-tax-cut--and-slash-more-taxes-for-the-rich/"&gt;https://www.salon.com/2021/04/28/key-democrats-want-to-keep-most-of-trumps-corporate-tax-cut--and-slash-more-taxes-for-the-rich/&lt;/a&gt;
Trump's tax cuts supercharged inequality and created a destructive, speculative finance-bubble by handing permanent tax gifts to the people who needed them the least. A full repeal of the SALT Cap is even more plute-friendly than Trump's plan.
The fact that Trump passed a SALT Cap out of spite is irrelevant. America's inequality crisis demands an end to regressive measures, including the special treatment of capital gains and carried interest, which gives tax advantages to speculators and punishes wage-earners.
Democrats will not win elections or change our political conversation with business-as-usual handouts to the super-rich in the hopes of winning campaign contributions. They have the money, we have the people.
Dems cannot win by being the party of the wealthy. The Republicans have that one on lock.

&lt;h1&gt;The good news is that Penguin Random House can't buy all the other publishers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/07/random-penguins/#if-you-wanted-to-get-there-i-wouldnt-start-from-here"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Correction&lt;/b&gt;: An earlier draft of this article characterized Frederic Wertham as "a far-right conspiracist." That was incorrect. While Wertham was a conspiracist, he was not far right. I regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;
Last week, a US District Court blocked the merger of Penguin Random House, the world's largest publisher, and Simon and Schuster, the world's third-largest publisher. This is very, very good news.
&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/01/1133032238/judge-blocks-penguin-random-house-simon-schuster-merger"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2022/11/01/1133032238/judge-blocks-penguin-random-house-simon-schuster-merger&lt;/a&gt;
During the trial, Penguin Random House argued that they would continue to compete with Simon and Schuster for books, bidding against them for prized titles. Stephen King punctured this absurd fiction, noting that this was like a husband and wife bidding against each other to buy the same house:
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/business/stephen-king-penguin-random-house-antitrust-testimony.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/business/stephen-king-penguin-random-house-antitrust-testimony.html&lt;/a&gt;
With the merger halted (pending appeal) the number of major trade publishers stands at five, which, while better than four, is still not very many. Practically speaking, it means that five corporate board-rooms are in charge of nearly all of our literature, deciding what gets published, what doesn't, and how those books are sold. That is a lot of power to vest in a very small number of hands.
This concentration of power is obviously bad for authors, since a failure to sell your book to editors at a mere five houses means that it will not come out from a major publisher. As Rebecca Giblin and I document in our new book &lt;em&gt;Chokepoint Capitalism&lt;/em&gt;, when publishing is this concentrated, copyright is largely irrelevant to authors' fortunes:

Concentration in publishing is also very bad news for publishing workers, a notoriously exploited group of people, whose working conditions are so bad that 1% of the entire sector's workforce resigned en masse last summer:
&lt;a href="https://bookriot.com/great-publishing-resignation/"&gt;https://bookriot.com/great-publishing-resignation/&lt;/a&gt;
For these workers, a failure to secure a decent wage at just five employers means that they have no hope of working at any major publisher.
And for readers, all of this means that the decisions about what you get to read are gathered into a vanishingly small number of hands. A tiny group of fallible humans will make decisions about what books are widely available, and, possibly even worse, a tiny group of fallible humans can be arm-twisted into not publishing works that governments or pressure groups don't want to see printed.
In 1954, a &lt;s&gt;far-right&lt;/s&gt; conspiracist named Fredric Wertham published a scientific hoax called "Seduction of the Innocent" that claimed that comic books were luring American children into a life of wanton sex, drug abuse and communism and/or fascism.
&lt;a href="http://www.lostsoti.org/"&gt;http://www.lostsoti.org/&lt;/a&gt;
Wertham whipped up a "groomer" panic about comic books and in response, bedwetting conservatives burned mountains of comics and demanded government censorship. Opportunistic lawmakers took up the cause and threatened the comics industry with unconstitutional regulation of their publishing programs.
The comics industry caved: a handful of cowardly executives formed a self-regulatory body called the "Comics Code Authority" whose seal of approval was withheld from all but the most inoffensive and bland of stories and illustrations. Most comics retailers refused to carry comics unless they bore this seal, and stores that bucked the Authority were raided and their owners fined or even jailed:
&lt;a href="https://cbldf.org/about-us/case-files/cbldf-case-files/"&gt;https://cbldf.org/about-us/case-files/cbldf-case-files/&lt;/a&gt;
The CCA continued to have veto power over most comics until the year 2000 - for nearly half a century, an unaccountable star-chamber of prudes ruled over an entire art form. That was only possible because that industry was first cornered by a handful of unaccountable executives, who then handed power to the CCA.
Readers, writers, retailers, editors and publishers &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; suffer under publishing monopolies. The fact that the court blocked Penguin Random House from gobbling up Simon and Schuster is good for all of us.
Except...
There's a reason PRH wanted to devour S&amp;amp;S. Back in 2010, the Big Six publishers entered into an illegal conspiracy with Apple to price-fix ebooks. The publishers wanted to force Amazon to stop subsidizing the Kindle books, selling them below the publishers' wholesale cost, and ensuring that all ebook purchases were &lt;em&gt;Kindle&lt;/em&gt; book purchases, generally locked to the Kindle forever by DRM.
Amazon has bottomless access to the capital markets as well as profitable divisions that it can use to prop up money-losing ones. The Big Six publishers understood that Amazon's ebook subsidy wasn't motivated by generosity towards readers - rather, it was about locking readers into the Kindle platform, and using that to secure leverage over publishers.
The publishers knew how Amazon would use that leverage. In the early 2000s, Amazon launched "Project Gazelle," an internal project to locate weak, small publishers that were dependent on Amazon for sales and then drive them out of business by demanding unsustainable discounts, like a cheetah hunting "a sickly gazelle":
&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sadistic-amazon-treated-book-sellers-the-way-a-cheetah-would-pursue-a-sickly-gazelle-2013-10"&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/sadistic-amazon-treated-book-sellers-the-way-a-cheetah-would-pursue-a-sickly-gazelle-2013-10&lt;/a&gt;
So they conspired with Apple to sell ebooks only on the Ipad, unless Amazon agreed to end its predatory pricing scheme. That was wildly illegal and the publishers and Apple all paid hundreds of millions in fines as a result:
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/07/apple-450-million-settlement-e-book-price-fixing-supreme-court"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/07/apple-450-million-settlement-e-book-price-fixing-supreme-court&lt;/a&gt;
More than a decade later, Amazon is an even bigger threat to publishers. For one thing, it has substantially expanded its own publishing program, directly competing with print, ebook and audiobook publishers. Amazon has eye-watering quantities of data on these publishers' customers - what they search for, which books they buy together, where they are when they read, how many pages they read before pausing or giving up, and more.
The publishers have &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of this data. Amazon has mountains of data about the publishers' products that the publishers themselves lack, and Amazon &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a publisher, but it's also their single most important retailer. The publishers are &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; fucked here.
Which is why there's all this pressure for the publishers to merge. When the CEO of Penguin, the CEO of Random House, and the CEO of Simon and Schuster meet to discuss Amazon pricing strategy, that is an illegal conspiracy. But when the &lt;em&gt;presidents&lt;/em&gt; of Random House (a division of PRH/S&amp;amp;S), Penguin (a division of PRH/S&amp;amp;S), and Simon and Schuster (a division of PRH/S&amp;amp;S) meet, that's just business.
And we've just blocked that. Which is good. The highly concentrated publishing industry is a real problem, but there's concentration all the way up and down the supply chain. For example, there's one national brick-and-mortar bookseller left.
It's even worse in distribution: Ingram is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; major national book distributor left. If you're an independent press who doesn't want to go with Ingram for distribution, you'll almost certainly end up being distributed by Penguin Random House - that is, your largest competitor. This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; bad for readers, writers, publishing workers, and literature itself.
This is the problem with monopolies: once there's a monopoly in your supply chain, everyone else in the supply chain has to form a monopoly or a cartel, or the monopoly will devour them. That's how the US got its infinitely cursed health-care system. Big Pharma merged to monopoly and price-gouged hospitals. Hospitals formed regional monopolies to fight pharma prices - and then gouged the insurers. The insurers merged with one another and divided up the country like the Pope dividing up the New World, and fought hospital pricing.
The whole health supply chain is monopolized, except for the patients at one end (paying higher prices for worse care) and the health care workers at the other end (getting paid less to work under worse conditions). The giants that run the industry may fight one another over how to divide the pie, but they all agree that we should get crumbs.
There's a joke whose punchline goes, "If you wanted to get there, I wouldn't start from here." The existence of the Amazon monopoly means that when we block mergers elsewhere in the publishing supply chain, we just leave those un-merged companies vulnerable to Amazon's predation. That's not to say that un-merged companies are bad, or letting them merge is good - just, if we wanted to get there, we wouldn't start from here.
But here we are, at the tail end of 40 years' worth of unbridled, uncontrolled corporate mergers. Simon and Schuster isn't just "Simon and Schuster" - it's part of Paramount, which owns dozens of TV networks (Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central, etc) as well as CBS and a bunch of amusement parks.
If we wanted to get somewhere we shouldn't start from here, but here we are, so what do we do? Well, there's an obvious remedy for companies that have merged to monopoly: break 'em up!
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/29/break-em-up/#break-em-up"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/29/break-em-up/#break-em-up&lt;/a&gt;
But breakups are &lt;em&gt;achingly&lt;/em&gt; slow. The breakup of AT&amp;amp;T took &lt;em&gt;sixty-nine years&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/jam-to-day-46b74d5b1da4"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/jam-to-day-46b74d5b1da4&lt;/a&gt;
There are other tools in our toolkit, though. Trustbusters once relied on "structural separation," the idea that companies that provided important platforms for other businesses couldn't be allowed to compete with those business - for example, rail companies couldn't own freight companies that competed with the shippers that were the rail companies' customers:
&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2022/03/cory-doctorow-vertically-challenged/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2022/03/cory-doctorow-vertically-challenged/&lt;/a&gt;
Structural separation would force Random House to decide whether to be a publisher or a distributor, and force Amazon to decide whether it was a retailer or a publisher. Structural separation is enjoying a renaissance: the EU Digital Markets Act bans large companies from competing with the apps in their app stores:
&lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/01/europe-confirms-its-digital-markets-act-will-go-after-apples-app-store"&gt;https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/01/europe-confirms-its-digital-markets-act-will-go-after-apples-app-store&lt;/a&gt;
But even if Random House decides to be a publisher and not a distributor, that leaves Ingram as the only major trade distributor. Even if Amazon stops being a publisher, it's still the only major ebook retailer. Power is still in too few hands!
How do we pluralize that power? Here's my idea, which is either a crank notion or a stroke of genius (I go back and forth on this question nearly daily): &lt;em&gt;declare a tax-holiday for capital gains from voluntary corporate breakups.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/shovel-ready-3433e0268c2e"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/shovel-ready-3433e0268c2e&lt;/a&gt;
I'm old enough to remember when corporate raiders and finance bros were obsessed with taking over companies and selling off their divisions, not merging them with their rivals. If we declare a three-year tax holiday for capital gains resulting from unwinding economically significant (&amp;gt;$1B) 21st century mergers, could we lure those corporate crooks out of retirement for one last heist?
I'm the first to admit that this has lots of downsides. For one thing, we're &lt;em&gt;paying&lt;/em&gt; the finance bros who destroyed our economy rather than, say, displaying them in stocks and pelting them with rotten vegetables. That's galling. I hate it.
The other major possible downside is that whatever limits we put on this (a three-year expiry, or a 20-year ban on re-merging companies after breakups) will be overridden by finance bros, who will use some of the profits from the program to expand it.
But I don't know for sure that either of those should be dealbreakers. If all we do is block terrible mergers between giant companies but we don't break up the monopolies that are choking every supply chain, we're just handing control to the monopolists who got in under the wire.
It's so crazy it just might work.

&lt;img alt="A Disney Dollar. In its central oval, Mickey Mouse has been replaced by a trustbuster-era editorial caricature of Teddy Roosevelt swinging a club." src="https://craphound.com/images/1BWe45Enp94vLdBROT5k0pQ.png"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Podcasting "Managing aggregate demand" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/09/computer-says-no/#shortages"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
This week on my podcast, I read "Managing Aggregate Demand," the fourth part in my ongoing Medium series about "amusement parks, crowd control and load-balancing."
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/managing-aggregate-demand-part-iv-8d2022a5125b"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/managing-aggregate-demand-part-iv-8d2022a5125b&lt;/a&gt;
It's a reflection on the economics of situations where demand outstrips supply - an issue that's very much in the news today, thanks to covid supply shocks (and it'll get only get worse, thanks to the climate emergency).
I draw on Ramsi Woodcock's Iowa Law Review article "The Efficient Queue and the Case Against Dynamic Pricing," an essay that presents a case for prohibiting ALL surge pricing as illegal under antitrust law.
&lt;a href="https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-105-issue-4/the-efficient-queue-and-the-case-against-dynamic-pricing/"&gt;https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-105-issue-4/the-efficient-queue-and-the-case-against-dynamic-pricing/&lt;/a&gt;
And I reiterate Len Testa's point that Disney parks have a huge advantage in prefering queues to auctions to control demand - because Disney tickets are tied to the buyer's identity, Disney can extinguish the secondary markets that touts create in other domains.
You may not be able to do anything about Friedman-addled sociopaths who pay homeless people to camp out to buy every Tickle Me Elmo doll before parents can buy them, in order to list them on Ebay at 1,000% markups - but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; stop people from reselling Disney tickets.
I podcasted the first three installments in this series last week:

I've just published part five in the series: "Expectations Management," about the covert, overt, moral and shady ways that Disney shapes the movement of crowds through its spaces:

&lt;a href="http://quillsconference.com/"&gt;http://quillsconference.com/&lt;/a&gt;
But I'll be back to record part five and maybe part six in two weeks, for the 400th (!!) episode of my podcast.

&lt;img alt="The cover for Max Barry's 'The 22 Murders of Madison May.'" src="https://craphound.com/images/9780593085202.tiff.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The 22 Murders of Madison May (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/09/computer-says-no/#existential-crisis"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
"The 22 Murders of Madison May" is a new science fiction crime thriller from Max Barry, a writer with a penchant for existentialism, hard-driving plots, and uncomfortable philosophical speculation.
&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612941/the-22-murders-of-madison-may-by-max-barry/"&gt;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612941/the-22-murders-of-madison-may-by-max-barry/&lt;/a&gt;
The premise of 22 Murders: a deranged stalker who has stolen a dimension-hopping device moves from one dimension to the next, seeking out Madison May, a minor film star whom he is obsessed with.
But in every universe, his victim has chosen a different path - realtor, student, barista - and he murders her in a rage before skipping to the next universe.
Dimension-hopping is a one-way journey, and it's hard to direct your path through the multiverse, but the murderer is obsessed and will not stop.
Felicity Staples is a reporter on the New York Daily News who is investigating one of these murders and ends up so embroiled that she, too is whisked into an adjacent dimension, one where everything is familiar...but wrong.
The tale proceeds: Felicity chases the killer, trying to protect Madison. The killer kills Madison and skips to the next universe. Gradually, Felicity learns more about the multiverse and the stolen science that propels the killer, and the others who are trying to stop him.
All of this is a finely tuned thriller, a legit, pacey page-turner with lots of excellent action and skullduggery, but all of that is in service to the true point of a multiverse tale - the moral speculation about what choice means, and what meaning our lives have.
After all, if everything that can happen does happen - if every choice you make one way, another version of you makes another way - then is there really any choice at all? Does anything matter?
That's some well-trod philosophical speculation, a mind-game that usually arrives at a place of pure nihilism, where nothing matters and nothing is real (think of Larry Niven's classic short story "All the Myriad Ways").
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Myriad_Ways"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Myriad_Ways&lt;/a&gt;
But Barry goes beyond cheap solipsism. After all, this is a book full of people who a) know that every bad thing that happens in one universe does not happen in another; and b) still try to prevent bad things from happening.
Barry's dimension-hoppers - even Madison and the murderer - are obsessed with finding or making a better universe, though they know that it will not prevent the worse ones. They are brave and hopeful, in the truest sense, because they know the cause is lost and yet they fight on.
That rejection of cynicism adds a rich depth to an otherwise merely excellent crime drama, like the difference between stew made with water and good stock.
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;a name="disciplinary-tech"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="A laptop on a desk; the laptop's screen is filled with the glowing red eye of HAL 9000 from 2001." src="https://craphound.com/images/40640192185_70c517aaa4_o.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;When your boss wants an AI camera in your bedroom (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/09/computer-says-no/#disciplinary-tech"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
When it comes to tech in the workplace, we pay too much attention to what the tech does, at the expense of a critical analysis of who the tech does it &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;, and who the tech does it &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;.
Take warehouse automation: stuff needs to get from A to B, and moving stuff is hard, dangerous work. In theory, warehouse automation is a critical part of making our world more humane and better for workers.
So how is it that Amazon leads the world in both worker injuries &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; warehouse automation? Worse, how is it that the more automated an Amazon warehouse is, the more workers get maimed and killed there?
The answer is not what the technology &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;, but who it does it &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;. Machines (including "smart" machines) can act as technological helpmeets, or as technological  straw-bosses.
&lt;img alt="A warehouse worker in hi-viz; his head has been replaced with a horse's head whose eyes are HAL 9000's red eyes from 2001." src="https://craphound.com/images/reversecentaur.jpg"/&gt;
When the machine helps the human do more than either is capable of on their own, we call the resulting pair a "centaur." But when the human helps the machine, we call that ghastly, lethal, literally dehumanizing arrangement a "reverse-centaur."
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/17/reverse-centaur/#reverse-centaur"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/17/reverse-centaur/#reverse-centaur&lt;/a&gt;
For Amazon's reverse-centaurs, automation means the tempo of work is ratcheted up until injury is inevitable. There's nothing intrinsically dangerous about robots that bring shelves to human pickers. The danger comes from management decisions about how fast to run the robots.
Amazon management can choose to run its warehouses in unsafe ways because its workforce isn't unionized, and thus lacks the bargaining leverage to force worker-friendly policies on its employers.
That's why Amazon was prepared to break the law to prevent warehouse workers in Bessamer, Alabama from unionizing under the RWDSU.
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive&lt;/a&gt;
It's not just warehouses - take app-based casual work. In theory, the idea of an app that helps workers and customers efficiently connect with one another in order to dispatch jobs means that workers can gain more control over their working days.
In practice, companies like Doordash use apps to coerce workers into taking jobs that are so poorly compensated that they lose money in the bargain - and then deploy dirty tech tricks to prevent workers from configuring their apps to prevent this.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#boss-app"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#boss-app&lt;/a&gt;
This isn't an intrinsic feature of apps - it's a choice that Doordash makes. They get to make it because they misclassify their workers and spend tens of millions to get laws passed that ban their workers from unionizing.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22&lt;/a&gt;
One unexpected upside of the lockdown was the number of well-compensated, white-collar workers who discovered that working from home is quite nice - a way to be more productive and a better parent and spouse.
Work-from-home &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be great. But only if the workers have the power to keep it from being terrible. The more precarious a worker is, the more the systems that make work-from-home possible are repurposed as  technological whip.
Take Arise, a company that provides work-from-home, outsource telephone customer service to the largest companies in the world - Disney, Airbnb, Carnival Cruises, Intuit and more.
Arise depends on worker misclassification so its workers pay for company-specific training, then it spies on their calls to ensure the women (mostly Black women) who pay for the privilege don't hang up on callers who make rape and death threats.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/29/impunity-corrodes/#arise-ye-prisoners"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/29/impunity-corrodes/#arise-ye-prisoners&lt;/a&gt;
These women supply their own computers, then install Arise spyware on them, and are required to silence their children and other family members while they are on-shift - a crying child could cost them their investment in training and equipment.
These are all management choices, not inevitabilities, and the factor that makes these choices possible is the lack of worker power (Arise workers have so little power that they have to PAY to quit their jobs, thanks to an "early cancellation fee" in their contracts).
For workers with little power - who lack either a union or a high-demand skill/experience mix - "work from home" is a thin euphemism for "live at work." Not only do you provide your boss with rent-free space in your home, he gets to colonize your whole house and family.
Take the hundreds of thousands of work-from-home call-center workers at Colombia's Teleperformance, who have been presented with a new, non-negotiable contract requiring them to have "AI"-powered cameras in their homes.
&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/big-tech-call-center-workers-face-pressure-accept-home-surveillance-n1276227"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/big-tech-call-center-workers-face-pressure-accept-home-surveillance-n1276227&lt;/a&gt;
The contract acknowledges that low-waged workers live in cramped quarters where it is impossible for a camera to avoid capturing family members, including minor children - so the contract requires workers to waive their family's privacy rights as a condition of employment.
This ghastly disciplinary technology is branded "TP Campus" and is billed as a means of preventing fraud and enforcing petty authoritarian rules like a "clean desk policy."
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afxV2fQ32JA"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afxV2fQ32JA&lt;/a&gt;
In countries where there are strong privacy laws TP Campus has been banned. Albanians working on the Apple UK account got the Information Commissioner to order Teleperformance to drop TP Campus for them.
&lt;a href="https://www.idp.al/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rekomandim_nr_27_AMSSHT.pdf"&gt;https://www.idp.al/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rekomandim_nr_27_AMSSHT.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Apple is just one of the tech giants that relies on Teleperformance - Uber and Amazon are two more. These companies are noteworthy not just because of how much they outsource, but also because of how much of their supply chains they own.
Historic antitrust principles (now being revived after a long slumber, as with the new Biden executive order) are suspicious of corporate vertical integration, and have gone so far as to impose "structural separation" - a ban on companies owning parts of their supply chains.
For example, structural separation might ban mobile platforms from making apps that compete with the offerings in their app stores; or ban Amazon from publishing books that compete with the books it sells.
But the tech giants claim this anticompetitive, sprawling vertical integration is "efficient" - the best way to run a company - nevermind this means that having your Amazon account suspended costs you your books, family photos, and business website.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/04/eighty-sixed/#thank-you-come-again"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/04/eighty-sixed/#thank-you-come-again&lt;/a&gt;
However, as much as tech giants champion vertical integration, it's a highly selective, self-serving proposition. When it comes to parts of the business that are most profitable when workers are brutalized, traumatized, maimed or killed, the companies change their tune.
Somehow, Facebook can "efficiently" be a mobile platform, a cloud company, a social media company, a currency issuer, a VR company and more - but can't &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; find a way to efficiently perform its core function of content moderation in-house.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/04/eighty-sixed/#thank-you-come-again"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/04/eighty-sixed/#thank-you-come-again&lt;/a&gt;
Surely it's a coincidence that the functions FB outsources are high-stakes, impossible-to-perform jobs performed by low-waged workers, and the fact that this lets the company scapegoat its subcontractors and their workers for moderation failures has nothing to do with it.
Teleperformance - and Arise, and other live-at-work companies with abused, atomized workforces - only exist because highly integrated giants have espoused the contradictory doctrine of owning their whole industry - and outsourcing the dirty work.
It's the heads-I-win/tails-you-lose core of monopoly capitalism. It's why Luddism is an important political critique today - the principle of paying as much attention to who machines do things &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; as much as &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the machines do.

The reason for these exploitative arrangements isn't to be found in the source-code for these devices, but rather in their political economy: the distribution of power among the people who deploy them and the people who are forced to use them.

&lt;h1&gt;How workers get trapped by "bondage fees" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/21/bondage-fees/#doorman-building"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Growing up in Toronto, I naturally held NYC in awe. As the joke goes, it takes two Torontonians to change a lightbulb: one to change it, and one to go to New York and make sure lightbulbs are still cool. When I went to New York, I had a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; place to stay: my cousin Maxine's rent-controlled apartment in a midtown doorman building off 23rd and Lex.
If you'd like an essay-formatted version of this post to read or share, here's a link to it on pluralistic.net, my surveillance-free, ad-free, tracker-free blog:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/21/bondage-fees/#doorman-building"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/21/bondage-fees/#doorman-building&lt;/a&gt;
Max was impossibly glamorous: a perfectly coiffed office manager at Colgate-Palmolive who earned an anthropology degree at CUNY, volunteered at the Brooklyn Zoo, and knew every trick for getting cheap tickets for museums, galleries and shows, and had an encyclopedic, up-to-the-minute knowledge of all the culture New York had to offer. Staying with cousin Max was fantastic and I went to New York as often as I could.
I went so often I even got to know Max's doormen, who didn't just know everyone in the building, but also all their regular visitors and guests. I'd get off the subway with my suitcase and lug it over to Max's place and the doorman would greet me by name and hand me the spare keys to 11-J and ask me how my trip had been.
The jobs in the apartment buildings in big northeastern US cities - superintendent, janitor, doorman, gardener, etc - were once union jobs, with benefits and a pension. Over the years, tenants' associations, homeowners' associations and condo boards switched out these union employees with long-term workers hired in from staffing agencies that promised lower costs.
Now, if you think about it for even a second, it's obvious that there's only one way that hiring a doorman through a staffing agency could be cheaper than just hiring the doorman: the staffing agency has to pay the doorman less. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; less, because the staffing agency is making money here, too - so the doorman is splitting that lower payment with the agency.
The staffing agencies are &lt;em&gt;platforms&lt;/em&gt; - just like Facebook, Google, Apple, and Tiktok. They have end-users (apartment dwellers) and business customers (workers who staff apartments), and they intermediate between them, selling one to the other and making money on both sides.
Like any platform, the staffing agency play is enshittification: first, making things good for end-users and business-customers, locking both in - and then withdrawing all the surplus from both sides of the two-sided market and pocketing it. Think of how Uber lost 41 cents on every dollar for more than a decade, until public transit investments had stagnated and yellow cabs had disappeared, allowing the company to double the cost of a ride and halve the compensation for drivers:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men&lt;/a&gt;
When it comes to enshittification, digital platforms like Uber had an advantage over analog systems like apartment buildings. Digital enshittifiers have lots of sliders and knobs they can endlessly twiddle, changing the rules of the platform so fast that neither end-users nor business customers can develop stable strategies for wrestling value back to themselves. As with any shell game, it's the quickness of the hand  that deceives the eye:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6&lt;/a&gt;
But digital platforms' ability to twiddle merely &lt;em&gt;improves&lt;/em&gt; enshittification. Digital enshittification is just the usual parasite's game of creating chokepoints between market actors and extract rent from anyone who wants to hire workers - or who wants to work.
Apartment workers who work through staffing agencies have seen declining wages and worsening benefits for years - which is another way of saying that apartment workers got more from the agencies at the beginning, but as the agencies locked up more apartment buildings and reduced the alternatives for workers, they clawed back their workers' wages and kept it for themselves.
Naturally, this is terrible for morale. It's hard to be that cheerful, deeply knowledgeable doorman or cleaner or super when you can't afford your own rent. For the end-users - HOAs, condo boards, tenants' associations - the natural play here would be to cut out the middleman. They could fire the agency and hire the workers direct.
Except they can't. It turns out that the staffing agencies negotiated secret "No Hire" agreements with the buildings. Under these deals, if a building hires any former agency worker, it has to pay the agency a penalty equal to three months' wages for every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; agency worker in the building. This keeps low-waged workers locked to the agencies, because the employer most likely to make them a better offer is the apartment building they've worked in for years and know like the backs of their hands, and the employer has to pay a massive fine if they hire the worker direct.
It's no wonder that these workers - and their newly voted-in union, SEIU 32BJ - have a blunter name for these "agreements": they call them "bondage fees." In an excellent piece for &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Workday Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, Sarah Lazare describes how these bondage fees are driving the immiseration of a group of workers who once earned a living wage for work that made life easier for people like my cousin Max:
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/labor/2023-04-21-bondage-fees-trap-contracted-workers/"&gt;https://prospect.org/labor/2023-04-21-bondage-fees-trap-contracted-workers/&lt;/a&gt;
Recall that the key to enshittification is lock-in. Platforms subsidize the arrangement between workers and customers at the start, and then they make it back by squeezing both. The easier it is for either to leave, the less it can squeeze. The more it hurts workers or customers to leave, the more pain the platform can inflict on both without losing their business.
Economists have a name for the penalties that platforms inflict on disloyal customers and workers: "switching costs." Digital platforms have elevated the inflation of switching costs to a fine art, from Facebook and Twitter holding your friends hostage; to Apple holding your media and apps hostage:
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs&lt;/a&gt;
Switching costs are at the heart of the staffing agencies' ripoffs of apartment workers. While the general skills of a building super, cleaner or doorman can transfer well to any jobsite, these workers have incredibly &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; buildings. The super knows how to fix the balky furnace extractor fan. The cleaner knows just how to reach that awkward corner behind the plant in the lobby. The doorman knows the kid from Toronto whose cousin lives in 11-J.
This means that these workers are especially valuable to the people who live in these buildings, which means that - all things being equal - these workers could bargain for higher wages, especially through their union. That's why the staffing agencies are so horny for bondage fees, because that's how they make sure that all things are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; equal.
As Lazare points out, bondage fees are basically just a wrinkle on an existing scam: noncompete agreements, which bind &lt;em&gt;one fifth&lt;/em&gt; of the US workforce, prohibiting workers from switching to a competitors' shop. While noncompetes are lauded as a way of protecting the assets of "knowledge" firms, the vast majority of workers chained to their jobs with noncompetes are low-waged workers in the fast-food sector. Do we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; think that there's a major trade secrecy issue in play when a McDonald's cashier switches to a Wendy's down the block for a $0.25/hour raise?
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#neofeudal"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#neofeudal&lt;/a&gt;
Even in those "knowledge" shops, the argument for noncompetes collapses in the face of evidence. In California, noncompetes are illegal under the state constitution. That means that &lt;em&gt;every single tech company in Silicon Valley&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; operated in an environment where employees were free to leave a bad job for a better one.
Indeed, the reason we call Silicon Valley "Silicon Valley" is intrinsically bound to this workers' freedom to change jobs. The first "silicon" company in Silicon Valley was Shockley Semiconductors, whose founder, William Shockley, got a Nobel prize for helping to invent the silicon transistor. Shockley was also a delusional racist paranoiac who offered his Nobel money as a bounty to any Black woman who'd get sterilized in the name of "improving the gene pool." He wasn't just an evil fuck, he was also impossible to work for, wiretapping his employees and even his family members, and creating a chaotic environment that failed to produce the microchips that his transistors promised.
Luckily for everyone who uses anything with a transistor (i.e. everyone), California bans noncompetes. That meant that his eight top employees could quit and start their own company. You may not have heard of Fairchild Semiconductor, the company that the "traitorous eight" founded, but you've &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; heard of the company that two of Fairchild's top employees quit and founded: Intel:
&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/a-the-traitorous-eight-and-the-battle-of-germanium-valley-86c455967d43"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/a-the-traitorous-eight-and-the-battle-of-germanium-valley-86c455967d43&lt;/a&gt;
If it wasn't for California's guarantee of a worker's right to quit a bad job and get a better one, we might be stuck with "Germanium Valley."
Noncompetes epitomize MLK's "socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor." They're a way for employers to operate in a command economy where the power of the state can be mobilized against uppity workers who dare to seek a better deal, and leave workers to sell their labor in a buyer's where the bidders have all the power.
Noncompetes are so manifestly unfair that the FTC has proposed a nationwide ban on them as an "unfair method of competition":
&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-extends-public-comment-period-its-proposed-rule-ban-noncompete-clauses-until-april-19"&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-extends-public-comment-period-its-proposed-rule-ban-noncompete-clauses-until-april-19&lt;/a&gt;
But, as Lazare points out, bondage fees are just noncompetes by another name. The major player in bondage fees is (ironically) a Toronto-based company called Firstservice, who operate through their subsidiary Planned Companies to enshittify apartment buildings on a massive scale. The workers organized by SEIU 32BJ have filed a complaint against Planned over these bondage fees:
&lt;a href="https://www.seiu32bj.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/32BJ-Complaint-Regarding-Planned-Companies.pdf"&gt;https://www.seiu32bj.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/32BJ-Complaint-Regarding-Planned-Companies.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Planned employs nearly half of the doormen and conceirges in the northeast; that's called a "monopsony." Monopsonies are the less-well-known twin brothers of monopolies, markets in which &lt;em&gt;buyers&lt;/em&gt; (rather than sellers) have power. Monoposony may be an obscure concept - unlike "monopoly," there's no family-destroying board-game to get us familiarized with the term. But monopsonies are just as toxic as monopolies, especially for workers, where an employer's ability to restrict the places where you can sell your labor can force workers into dangerous, miserable conditions. Maybe if Tennessee Ernie Ford had figured out how to rhyme "company store" with "monopsony," we'd be more alive to this danger:
&lt;a href="https://genius.com/Tennessee-ernie-ford-sixteen-tons-lyrics"&gt;https://genius.com/Tennessee-ernie-ford-sixteen-tons-lyrics&lt;/a&gt;
Though Planned's workers organized under SEIU in 2019, they still don't have a contract. Among their top demands: an end to bondage fees. The staffing agencies say that these fees are necessary to recoup the costs "associated with recruiting and referring temporary workers." But we're talking about workers with years - &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt; - of experience. Those costs were recouped many times over:
&lt;a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA639809660&amp;amp;amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;amp;amp;v=2.1&amp;amp;amp;it=r&amp;amp;amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;amp;amp;issn=15385876&amp;amp;amp;p=AONE&amp;amp;amp;sw=w&amp;amp;amp;userGroupName=anon%7E2f553b8b"&gt;https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA639809660&amp;amp;amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;amp;amp;v=2.1&amp;amp;amp;it=r&amp;amp;amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;amp;amp;issn=15385876&amp;amp;amp;p=AONE&amp;amp;amp;sw=w&amp;amp;amp;userGroupName=anon%7E2f553b8b&lt;/a&gt;
Bondage fees are closely held secrets. Planned's workers can hold their jobs for years without knowing of their existence. But the &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt; got ahold of some of these secret agreements, finding one- and two-year noncompete clauses hidden in them. As more Planned/Firstservice workers try to form unions, the company has begun illegally firing the organizers, like Kevin Borowske. Borowske was a live-in caretaker at Minneapolis's Centre Village, and when Firstservice fired him for trying to start a union, he didn't just lose his job, he lost his home, too.
For bosses using bondage fees to lock in workers, secrecy is vital. Without a good record of where these agreements exist, let alone their specifics, it's hard for state and federal enforcers to take them on. There's no better way to drag these dirty secrets into the public than through strong unions.

And now, here's today's concluding serial installment:
“I mean, what do I get?”
The transformation was incredible. One minute, he’d been a scared old man, desperate, literally pleading for his life. In a flash, he was calm, back in the realm of numbers, and I was making a deal with a guy who’d eaten ramen for twenty-­two years rather than surrender any more of his future fortune than was absolutely necessary.
“Well, a twenty-­five percent commission is obviously out of the question. We’re talking about a billion dollars here.”
“That’s if I recover the keys before they exfiltrate any of that money. My commission is based on value at recovery, not initial value. So if any of this goes public and the value of a Trustlesscoin falls to zero, then I get twenty-­five percent of nothing.”
He looked sour. “If that happens, you won’t have anywhere to send your invoice for your twenty-­five percent, either. But, Marty, you can’t seriously expect a two-­hundred-­and-­fifty-­mil upside here.”
“Daniel Moses Lazer, you just got through lecturing me on the trillions in &lt;em&gt;downside&lt;/em&gt; if those keys aren’t recovered. Note that I did not say that I expected any share of the positive externalities a successful recovery would generate. Just the direct benefit to my client.” I nodded at him.
“But a quarter of a billion dollars—­”
“Or maybe it’s nothing. Or maybe I’ll find myself face-­to-­face with these killers you say you’d have to cower in a bunker over until the end of your natural life. Danny, I’m surprised at you. You know who I am. You know what I charge. You know I don’t haggle.”
He smiled, and I saw a little of the happy, well-­fed, successful second act that he’d projected when he answered his door. “Yeah, I know. But I had to try. Two hundred and fifty mil is two hundred and fifty mil.”
“A quarter of a billion dollars here, a quarter of a billion there—­”
“Yeah, yeah. Pretty soon, we’re talking real money. You think you can do it?”
I shrugged. “Can’t say. I have some ideas about how to start, covering the bases, being my normal, meticulous self. You’d be surprised how often that works. If there’s a fast resolution to this scam, it’ll be because the people on the other side of it forgot to dot an i or cross a t. They have to make zero mistakes; I just have to find one error. They have to be perfect; I just have to be systematic. It’s why I play the red team. Advantage to the attacker, as always.”
“As always.” He checked his watch. “Shit, I got to get my phone for a second here. Can you give me a minute?”
“Sure,” I said as he grabbed his phone and mine, giving me mine back absently as he powered his up and logged in to it even as he slid through his sliding doors and into that picture-­perfect living room.
I didn’t power up my phone right away. First, because it was a game I played with myself: How long could I go without ramming its phosphors into my eyeballs? Second, because I wanted to mull over this job. And third, because I had a sense from Sethu’s body language that she wanted to have a word with me.
She stepped away from the painting. She really was very good. Whatever she’d done to it while Danny and I had been talking had brought it to life in a way I couldn’t exactly articulate, making it seem energetic, hinting at all the feverish activity in the home offices and garages and cars in that impressionistic landscape. She gave it hustle.
“Danny tells me you’ve done this work before,” she said, hanging her smock on the easel and wiping her hands with an oily rag.
“Since the earliest days,” I said. “Most accountants saw the spreadsheet as a tool for making their lives easier. A smaller group realized its potential for covering up financial crimes. I think I was the only member of that second group that wanted to prevent the crimes, rather than creating them.”
“So there were three groups,” she said.
“I guess so,” I said. “The bean counters, the crooks, and me. Pretty sure we used to all hang out in the same Usenet support group for advanced Lotus 1–­2–­3 users.”
“You’ve solved a lot of cases?”
“You make me sound like a detective. Yeah, I’ve made some of my clients pretty happy.”
“Danny said you just had a big victory?”
“Rearden Factoring. They’re financial engineers, leveraging supply-­chain desperation. If you’re a big blue chip, you tell your suppliers that you’re paying them on one hundred and eighty days net unless they sign up with Rearden, which will process their invoices in thirty days in exchange for a two percent commission. Rearden doesn’t charge the buyers anything for this; it just leverages up that free cash flow, turning it into capital for big bets in the capital markets, rotating its positions with every billing cycle. It’s a lucrative business.”
“It sounds like a dirty business,” she said.
“No dirtier than any monopoly scam. The bigger the bigs get, the better the terms they can extract from their supply chain. It’s the golden rule: they have the gold, they make the rules.”
“And you helped them?”
“I did. Insider job, but he made a mistake. I caught it.”
“That is a lucky break. Why would someone so competent in one domain be so foolish in another?”
“That is a mystery that I have pondered since I first figured out my old man was a brilliant mechanical engineer and a dribbling idiot when it came to politics, Sethu. If I ever figure out the answer to that question, I’ll be sure to let you know.”
She and I exchanged a look that meant something, though I couldn’t have said what. If Sethu was a gold digger who’d tricked Danny into having something to live for, I wasn’t going to fault her for it or begrudge her any of Danny’s holdings, assuming he had any holdings in a week or two. Teaming up with a young, beautiful, devastatingly intelligent woman wasn’t a lapse in Danny’s brilliance as far as I was concerned—­it was his smarts carrying over from one domain into the next.
“Thanks for the history lesson,” she said. “Always fascinating to hear these tales from the electronic frontier.”
“Anytime,” I said as she picked up the easel and went back indoors, passing Danny in the doorway as he came out to me.
“Did she grill you?” he asked.
“Just a friendly chat,” I said.
“Well, then, you got lucky. She’s my equal partner in Trustless, and she’s also the beneficiary of my estate. She has as much at stake as I do here. Even before this incident, she told me I was too trusting. Me! If she’s willing to trust you, you should take it as a standing ovation in your little one-­man show, Martin Hench: Stand-­Up Guy.”
“It’s a performance that’s wowed ’em for a generation,” I said.
“Well, maybe this will be your grand finale. An old player who happens on a quarter billion dollars doesn’t need to perform for his grubstake anymore.”
“But you didn’t quit when you had the chance,” I said, before realizing with a wince that he had quit, quit everything and made ready to quit life itself.
He saw the wince, and his eyes and voice softened. “I nearly did. Maybe I should have.”

I'm teaching a writing seminar for teens through the Clarion West writing workshop this Thursday, 4/16, from 12-1PM Pacific. It's called "Stories are Super Weird. Here’s Why They Work."

"Stories are weird. Why do we care about imaginary people? How can you make strangers care about &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; imaginary people? Cory explains how to get readers engaged with the lives and deaths of people who never existed and never will exist and therefore do not matter at all."
It's part of a slate of teen writing workshops Clarion West is offering:

&lt;h1&gt;Trump will deliver killing blow to the USPS (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/13/control-c/#art-1-sec-8"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The USPS is about to declare bankruptcy. It's at the center of the longstanding plans for disaster recover and has been since the Cold War. It's the only institution that could (for example) deliver covid meds to every home in America in one day.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/25/national-emergency-library/#going-postal"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/25/national-emergency-library/#going-postal&lt;/a&gt;
But Congress has decided not to bail out the postal service, despite Art 1, Sec 8 of the US Constitution: "To establish Post Offices and post Roads."
Maybe it's because without a USPS we couldn't have a postal vote in 2020?
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/27/just-asking-questions/#save-usps"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/27/just-asking-questions/#save-usps&lt;/a&gt;
The proximate cause of the post office's bankruptcy is the pandemic, but that is merely the finishing blow. The USPS was murdered in 2006, when Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.
https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/04/will-the-united-states-post-office-become-a-victim-of-covid19.html
The Act gave the USPS a mere 10 years to "prefund its future health care benefit payments to retirees for the next 75 years." That is, to set aside cash to pay medical bills for future employees who hadn't been born yet.
&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-6407"&gt;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-6407&lt;/a&gt;
The USPS's murder is straight out of the neoliberal playbook: "1 Defund, 2 claim crisis, 3 call for privatizatization, 4 profit!"
As Lambert Strether points out, it was a bipartisan act of murder, cosponored by the "centrist" Democrat Henry Waxman.
Killing the USPS looms large in the Trump admin's (nonmetaphorical, actual) privatization playbook, "Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations":
&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Government-Reform-and-Reorg-Plan.pdf"&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Government-Reform-and-Reorg-Plan.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
The proposals are for USPS to become a Wework clone or franchisee, but not to become a publicly owned bank - a common line of business for other nations' postal services, natural based on the amounts of cash they handle.
The USPS is the nation's second largest employer of veterans, with 630,000 employees. Trump is about to allow it to collapse so that UPS, Fedex and other private firms can skim off the most profitable parts of its business and leave rural Americans totally isolated.
The loss of the USPS would mean the loss of the last truly universal federal program in America and would unduly hammer the people whom Trump claims to love -- veterans and rural voters.

&lt;h1&gt;Fighting the EU Copyright Directive in court (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/13/control-c/#control-c"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
"Impact litigation" is an invaluable activist tool. When lawmakers enact a rule that violates your constitution, you sue to have the law overturned. That means that you can reverse bad law and establish key protections through the courts.
It's true that lawyers are expensive, but not as expensive as, say, convincing the majority of lawmakers to betray the industry groups that lobbied them to pass an unjust law. Lobbying delivers returns on spending almost without limit: there's always more you can accomplish with more lobbying.
But courtroom battles are different. As expensive as they can be, adding more lawyers to your battle does not produce returns beyond a threshold. Same goes for exotic tactics like paying experts to write law review articles to support your theory - beyond a certain ceiling, spending more money does not improve your case.
It's not an even playing field between activists and industry, but it's more even than any other.
Impact litigation requires that you have a constitutional court that can apply scrutiny and invalidate law based on a set of constitutional principles, and it helps if that constitution has been around for a while, attracting jurisprudence that clarifies its meaning.
That's why impact litigation is such a powerful tactic in the USA, but has been less used in countries like Canada (whose Charter of Rights and Freedoms was established in 1982, and has a huge loophole in the "Notwithstanding Clause"):
&lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4438198/notwithstanding-clause-doug-ford-bill-5-toronto-city-council/"&gt;https://globalnews.ca/news/4438198/notwithstanding-clause-doug-ford-bill-5-toronto-city-council/&lt;/a&gt;
The EU's top court, the CJEU, is older and better established, but many of the principles it upholds are newer, and its contemporary form only dates to 2009 and the Treaty of Lisbon, so its contours are not as crisp as you might like.
But when it comes to internet law, the CJEU has proved itself a force-multiplier for pushback against corporate hegemony:
&lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/intl/schrems/"&gt;https://epic.org/privacy/intl/schrems/&lt;/a&gt;
EU activists are expanding their use of impact litigation, which is amazing. For example, Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte, which relies on Art 5 of German Basic Law (freedom of expression, press, information, arts, sciences, and from censorship) and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
They've just spun out a new project, Control-C, run by Julia Reda, the former Pirate Party MEP who did outstanding work fighting the 2019 Copyright Directive and its disastrous Article 13 (now Article 17).
&lt;a href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/urheberrecht/"&gt;https://freiheitsrechte.org/urheberrecht/&lt;/a&gt;
Article 17 mandates upload filters for online services, requiring them to subject all user-submitted content to automated surveillance and blocking if the algorithm believes you have violated copyright.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/EVfQeMlUwAEetvZ.jpg"&gt;
The rule was the most controversial EU undertaking ever, with more than 5M signatures on a petition against it (the largest petition in EU history), and marches in 50+ cities. It passed by 5 votes (and afterwards 10 MEPs said they were confused and pushed the wrong button).
To pass it, its backers wrote some "protections" into the rule, including a guarantee that these filters would not block content that included copyrighted works for the purpose of commentary, criticism, parody and pastiche.
This means that the filters will only be legal if they can (for example) tell the difference between a song that samples a musician to condemn them for supporting the Directive, and one that does the same thing to celebrate them for their support.
I haven't been a programmer for a long time, but I'm sceptical that this is possible, and this leads me to believe that the inclusion of these "protections" was either profoundly cynical or profoundly ignorant.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/02/europeans-deserve-have-their-governments-test-not-trust-filters"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/02/europeans-deserve-have-their-governments-test-not-trust-filters&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/EVfQWRnUYAAcpkS.jpg"&gt;
What's more, there is literally no conceivable way that automatically surveilling and judging everything that every European posts to the internet can comply with the GDPR:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/02/upload-filters-are-odds-gdpr
So the launch of Control-C is very exciting. Article 17 was plainly illegal and was only passed thanks to enormous spending by entertainment industry lobbyists (who falsely claimed the majority of spending was from the tech sector):
&lt;a href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/2018/12/copyright-directive-how-competing-big-business-lobbies-drowned-out-critical-voices"&gt;https://corporateeurope.org/en/2018/12/copyright-directive-how-competing-big-business-lobbies-drowned-out-critical-voices&lt;/a&gt;
In reality, the US-based tech sector's first preference was to have no Directive, but its second preference was to have THIS Directive, which would make it impossible to launch EU-based competitors as they could never afford to comply with it.
That's why Facebook and Youtube both lobbied FOR filters (they already have them).
A17 is ripe for impact litigation. The cause is urgent. The pandemic has made educators reliant on online resources even as geographic and use restrictions have made these &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; less reliable.

&lt;h1&gt;Virginia's election-day holiday (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/13/control-c/#ralph-northam"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has made election day a statewide holiday, joining the handful of other states that have passed this vital, democracy-protecting law, like Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky and New York.
&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/12/politics/virginia-election-day-holiday-early-voting/index.html"&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/12/politics/virginia-election-day-holiday-early-voting/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
It should be a federal holiday. It isn't, because Republicans believe that increased voter turnout is bad for their electoral chances.
&lt;a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/30/saying-quiet-part-very-loud-trump-admits-youd-never-have-republican-elected-country"&gt;https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/30/saying-quiet-part-very-loud-trump-admits-youd-never-have-republican-elected-country&lt;/a&gt;
That's why Mitch McConnell has rejected any attempt to establish a federal voting holiday, claiming that it would allow federal employees (whom he loathes) to "hang out at the polls during an election" or campaign for candidates.
Northam's new holiday-establishing order also eliminates Virginia's Lee-Jackson day holiday, which celebrated the traitorous, slave-owning Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson, who murdered American soldiers to defend their right to treat other Americans as property.
Here's a campaign to #TakeBackTuesday and establish a US-wide election-day holiday.

&lt;h1&gt;Quantifying Boris Johnson's body-count (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/13/control-c/#the-nasty-party"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In the early days of the pandemic, the UK pursued a plan that was developed for a less contagious, less lethal flu pandemic, which proposed deliberately allowing the disease to burn through the population quickly to develop "herd immunity."
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/feb/27/what-are-the-uks-plans-for-dealing-with-a-pandemic-virus"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/feb/27/what-are-the-uks-plans-for-dealing-with-a-pandemic-virus&lt;/a&gt;
Despite expert advice that this would not work with the novel coronavirus, the UK Tory government pushed ahead with it. PM Boris Johnson sought out covid patients to shake hands with while gerning for newscameras. (He ended up in intensive care).
&lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/boris-johnson-says-shaken-hands-coronavirus-patients-1490214"&gt;https://www.newsweek.com/boris-johnson-says-shaken-hands-coronavirus-patients-1490214&lt;/a&gt;
How much damage did this political malpractice inflict upon Britons? It turns out there's something of a national experiment that we can use to answer that question, by looking at what happened in the Republic of Ireland.
These are two neighbouring, English-speaking nations with similar cultures (Ireland was long a colony of Britain), comparably underfunded health services, and they experienced their first covid cases on the same day.
By comparing the outcomes in the two countries, we can get an estimate of how lethal the Conservative government's incompetence really was.
It's not pretty.
As medical historian Elaine Doyle writes in an epic thread, Britons are dying at &lt;em&gt;more than twice&lt;/em&gt; the rate of the Irish.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/laineydoyle/status/1249127908876128259"&gt;https://twitter.com/laineydoyle/status/1249127908876128259&lt;/a&gt;
Doyle points out that as the Irish government was shutting schools, 250,000 people in the UK were gathering for a Cheltenham match.
Ireland canceled St Paddy's Day and shut pubs a week in advance. The UK had megaconcerts like the Stereophonics gig in Cardiff.
The Irish government made clear, continuous announcements about the gravity of the pandemic, urging people to stay home and take care. The UK government was virtually silent.
The thing about exponential growth is that early interventions make a huge difference. The UK dawdled for nearly two weeks before taking the lockdown steps that the Irish enacted.
The Tory ideology holds that governments are incompetent. This creates a perverse incentive: when Tories govern badly, they prove their own point. But Tories are supposed to murder poor people to juice the economy, not murder pensioners AND the economy.
Boris Johnson is a vile piece of work: a racist, misogynist bigot and a fool. His unwillingness to take (medical) expert advice (and his reliance on finance-sector advice) resulted in the measurable, deaths of Britons. Thousands of them.

The US and the UK have been locked in a fierce competition since March, to see who can bungle their coronavirus response worse. The US is the clear leader here, both in per-capita deaths and infections and in elevating lethal junk-science to a conservative loyalty test.
But the UK has put in a remarkable showing.
Remember "cumgate" (Prime Ministerial advisor Dominic Cummings' breathtaking violation of his own lockdown rules)?
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/can-you-imagine-having-to-work-with-these-truth-twisters"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/can-you-imagine-having-to-work-with-these-truth-twisters&lt;/a&gt;
Then there's Boris Johnson, who beat Trump in the who-gets-infected-first race by months.
For all that the UK has lost most of the events in Infection Olympics to its American cousins, it continues to lead in that most quintessentially &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt; of events: the omnishambles.
Maybe it's the lower population or the high degree of inbreeding in the British upper classes, but whatever the secret is, you just can't beat HMG when it comes to awarding lucrative and vital contracts to bumbling politically connected insiders.
The Tories are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; good at this that it's nearly impossible to keep up. That's where Sophie E Hill's "My Little Crony" comes in, being an interactive visualisation tool for tracking and tracing the UK's world-beating incompetence and corruption.
&lt;a href="https://sophieehill.shinyapps.io/my-little-crony/"&gt;https://sophieehill.shinyapps.io/my-little-crony/&lt;/a&gt;
Drawing on public data sources from Opendemocracy, the Byline Times and elsewhere, Hills's visualiser lets you explore the connections between government contracts, political donations and the familial/corporate/social connections that link them.
From shadowy offshore entities to dirty trickster PR agencies to those fun-loving lads and lasses at Serco, Hills gives us the red-yard-and-pushpin version of the mass-murdering, economy-destroying, NHS-worker-applauding Tory response to the virus.
Have a rummage, you'll be furious you did!

Chaos and Cosmos is Tor Books's campaign promoting six new sf/f novels:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Memory of Souls by Jenn Lyons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master of Poisons by Andrea Hairston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To Sleep in a Sea of Stars by Christopher Paolini&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burning Roses by S. L. Huang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V. E. Schwab. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As well as my own ATTACK SURFACE, the third Little Brother book.

In addition to online samplers of excerpts from the books and videos in which the authors talk about their process and ideas, Tor's also offering a sweepstakes to win all six titles.
The books come in a handsome tote-bag, and the competition is open to readers in the US and Canada (Tor is not the publisher for these books in other parts of the world, sorry).
The deadline to enter is Nov 20:

&lt;h1&gt;Trump wants to dismantle the OTF (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/19/art-of-the-deal/#save-otf"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
For years, Congress allocated funds to the United States Agency for Global Media for the Open Technology Fund, a nonprofit that makes grants to internet freedom tools like Tor and Wireguard, as well as research projects, conferences and initiatives.
&lt;a href="https://www.opentech.fund/results/supported-projects/"&gt;https://www.opentech.fund/results/supported-projects/&lt;/a&gt;
I've been a (not hugely active) volunteer member of the advisory board for years, which means that periodically I hear from people who want to know - given the US's long history of overseas spook fuckery - why they shouldn't assume this is a CIA front.
I have a great answer for them! You can tell this isn't a nefarious scheme to backdoor the tools that marginalized and oppressed people around the world (and in the USA) rely on because all that code is free and open. You can audit it for backdoors. Others can too. They have.
NARRATOR: ONE DAY, ALL THAT CHANGED
The Trump admin wants to nuke the OTF and give all its money to a bunch of grifty, closed-source privacy and firewall-circumvention tools. These tools are NOT auditable, and the companied that make them stand to make BANK from the move.
I have no idea whether these companies are CIA fronts, but I tell you what, if i was a Uyghur in Xinjiang or a dissident in Tehran, I would NOT trust my life to these tools. No goddamned way.
Even if these companies &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; fronts for spooks, they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be in the future. Because if the companies that made these tools - companies that had been dealt a huge favor by the US government - were suborned for surveillance later, it would be very hard to catch them.
OTF's ironclad rule of funding open, free code isn't just a way to allay suspicions about the tools' true purpose - it's also a preventative against corruption, because the projects OTF funds &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; insert spy code without being caught right away.
Based on this administration's track record, I'm about 70-30 that this is just a bro deal that lets some cronies suck up millions in corporate welfare while hanging out tools used by vulnerable people around the world to dry.
But even if that's the case, I'm &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; 70-30 that spook agencies will get a twofer out of it, by suborning the beneficiaries of those bro deals.
Here's the petition. Remember, Congress allocated this money for the OTF, not as pork for a bunch of connected insiders.
&lt;a href="https://saveinternetfreedom.tech/"&gt;https://saveinternetfreedom.tech/&lt;/a&gt;
This money built the tools that Black Lives Matter protesters use, to say nothing of the Hong Kong protests and many other movements around the world.
It will be a genuine, deep, widespread tragedy if this move isn't stopped.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/algonuts.png"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Algonuts (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/19/art-of-the-deal/#robosparky"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
One of my all-time favorite techno-artists is Shardcore, whose experiments in machine learning never fail to delight.
Case in point: Algonuts, his latest project.
&lt;a href="http://www.shardcore.org/shardpress2019/2020/06/17/algonuts/"&gt;http://www.shardcore.org/shardpress2019/2020/06/17/algonuts/&lt;/a&gt;
Shardcore scraped 18,000 Peanuts scripts (63,800 panels!) and fed them to styleGAN2 to produce a model that generates an uncanny, shifting set of Peanuts panels.
StyleGAN2 is a "generative adversarial network," a tool that uses two competing machine-learning models to produce amazing outcomes.
&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/ai-created-art-invades-chelsea-gallery-scene/584134/"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/ai-created-art-invades-chelsea-gallery-scene/584134/&lt;/a&gt;
In a GAN, one model (the generator) makes things in accord with its training data; the other (the discerner) scores the generator's creations based on its training data, either saying "Ooh, that's a good one" or "Nah, try again."
In the way that a predator carves the prey and the prey shapes the predator, the discerner and the generator train one another, ascending a gradient towards uncanny accuracy.
In this case, weirdly plausible Peanuts cartoons from a parallel universe.
Shardcore: "In some ways, the model represents the disembodied essence of the Peanuts aesthetic, but do I have Charles Shulz soul? For many obvious reasons, I do not – this model knows nothing of the motivations, desires and intentions behind Charles Shulz and his works. "
"Does this model represent a threat to this intellectual property? In practical terms, no, not unless I aim to pass off the works as Shulz originals. But even then, at what point does a novel image ‘inspired’ by a body of work constitute a copyright violation?"

&lt;h1&gt;Trump's covid "test-tubes" are contaminated miniature soda bottles (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/19/art-of-the-deal/#art-of-the-deal"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Trump admin has awarded 2.6B in coronavirus contracts to first-time bidders, many of them unqualified grifters who played Trump and his administration for suckers and got away clean.
Exhibit A: Fillakit LLC, who got $7.3m to provide sterile test-tubes. Instead, they shipped FEMA soda-bottle "preforms" - these are miniature soda-bottles that you fit into a pressure blower that inflates them up 2l bottles.
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-trump-administration-paid-millions-for-test-tubes-and-got-unusable-mini-soda-bottles"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/the-trump-administration-paid-millions-for-test-tubes-and-got-unusable-mini-soda-bottles&lt;/a&gt;
Not only are these miniature soda-bottles and not test-tubes, they are also in NO WAY sterile. Here's how they were packed:
"Fillakit employees, some not wearing masks, gathered the miniature soda bottles with snow shovels and dumped them into plastic bins before squirting saline into them, all in the open air."
Writing for Propublica, J David McSwane and Ryan Gabrielson paint a picture of a semi-competent conman who made a fortune while helping to destroy America's capacity to fight the pandemic of the century, abetting mass murder and economic collapse.
It's not surprising Fillakit had never earned a federal contract prior to coronavirus. The company was formed "just six days" before it won its contract.
Its founder? Paul Wexler, "an ex-telemarketer repeatedly accused of fraudulent practices over the past two decades."
But, you know, maybe tiny, contaminated soda bottles have some medical value?
"They’re the most unusable tubes I’ve ever seen. They’re going to sit in a warehouse and no one can use them. We won’t be able to do our full plan." - "top public health official," unnamed state.
"Wexler, Fillakit’s owner, has a background in law and real estate, not medical supplies. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission accused Wexler and his telemarketing firm of illegal robocalling, making unauthorized charges to consumers’ bank accounts and falsely claiming to be a nonprofit org. Wexler’s firm allegedly misrepresented itself as a credit counseling service for several years, charging customers for work it did not do, according to court records."
"Wexler denied a request to tour the warehouse. Asked about the lack of sterile conditions and the use of soda preforms, Wexler screamed, 'What’s your problem, man?'"
(He seems nice.)
To recap: a telemarketing grifter with a background in real estate sold Trump $7.3m worth of fake, contaminated test-tubes that undermined multiple states' covid testing capacity.
Ladeez and gennulmun, I give you: &lt;em&gt;the art of the deal&lt;/em&gt;!

&lt;a name="avia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/france-63022_960_720.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Avia, c'est mort (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/19/art-of-the-deal/#avia"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Last month, France adopted the Avia bill, a law that gave online platforms one hour to remove terrorist speech. This law was not a good law.
Start with whether France's authorities use such powers wisely.
They do not.
A year ago, the French Internet Referral Unit sent notice to the Internet Archive demanding the removal of more than 15,000,000 documents for violating anti-terrorism rules. These documents included the Archive's repository of Grateful Dead music.
&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190410/14580641973/eu-tells-internet-archive-that-much-site-is-terrorist-content.shtml"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190410/14580641973/eu-tells-internet-archive-that-much-site-is-terrorist-content.shtml&lt;/a&gt;
Thankfully, France's highest court has struck down these provisions of Avia, partly in response to an amicus brief filed by EFF.

"We applaud the court for recognizing that citizens’ rights of free speech and expression are paramount in a democratic society, and the bill’s deadlines for removal were so inflexible and extreme that those rights would be violated under France’s constitution." -Christoph Schmon.

A new poll from Morning Consult and Politico finds that &amp;gt;75% of Americans favor maintaining or expanding the extended unemployment payments from the pandemic stimulus bills.
&lt;a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2020/06/17071351/200671_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_AUTO.pdf"&gt;https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2020/06/17071351/200671_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_AUTO.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
But GOP politicians intend to terminate the payments, and they've been clear about why: poor people won't risk death or permanent disability  in order to serve cocktails or give manicures unless the alternative is homelessness and starvation.

This is a monumentally unpopular position, with only 13% support nationwide (even limiting the poll to registered Republicans yields a mere 21% support).

&lt;h1&gt;Microsoft criticizes Apple's monopolism (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/19/art-of-the-deal/#honi-soit-qui-mal-y-pense"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Microsoft knows a monopoly when it sees one!
The company has made a veiled accusation of antitrust  violations against Apple for the way it operates its App Stores (the company spoke out against app stores in general).
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-18/microsoft-says-antitrust-regulators-need-to-review-app-stores"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-18/microsoft-says-antitrust-regulators-need-to-review-app-stores&lt;/a&gt;
Micros~1's president Brad Smith spoke on the issue in a Politico videoconference, citing the "rules," "the prices," and "the tolls."
Smith's remarks come as EU antimonopoly regulators launched an investigation into Apple's store.
&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/618bsmlivestream"&gt;https://www.politico.com/618bsmlivestream&lt;/a&gt;
While the issues - pricing, terms, etc - are the easiest to point at and study, they are effects, not causes, of anticompetitive action.
The root cause is lock-in. Apple's mobile devices are designed so that owners of these devices can only buy their apps from Apple.
Section 1201 of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Article 6 of the EU Copyright Directive both hold criminal and civil sanctions for rivals that offer to install competing stores in Apple's devices (and other devices that use DRM to enforce app store monopolies).
Apple has vigorously defended this radical interpretation of copyright law, insisting that copyright is somehow served when a copyright owner - a software developer who made an app - is prohibited by law from selling their work to Apple customers without Apple's blessing.
Apple's store policies have been unilaterally altered at several junctions in Apple's history, often to the detriment of Apple's software vendors. These vendors weren't able to respond by selling their apps in a rival's store.
This is an absolutely unequivocal anticompetitive environment. It literally forbids competition. You don't get more anticompetitive than that.
But Microsoft is still playing with fire. After a period of battle-scarred forbearance following from the DoJ's failed antitrust action against the company, it has returned to its monopolistic ways with real gusto.
Much of the company's "growth" has been acquisitions - Microsoft isn't a "making things" company, it's a "buying things" company.
It's true that US regulators have all but abandoned this element of antitrust law, but it's still there, waiting.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/technical-excellence-and-scale"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/technical-excellence-and-scale&lt;/a&gt;
If Microsoft thinks it can wake America's antitrust guardians from their 40-year slumber merely to attack Apple's App Stores, they're in for a rude shock. If App Stores wake them, they will not return to their hibernation. They'll keep going.
To be fair to Microsoft, they're not alone in thinking that antitrust may be for thee, not me. Cable monopolists have lobbied hard for antitrust enforcement against the tech companies that wanted Net Neutrality and other tech-friendly, telecoms-unfriendly policies.
They, too, are sadly mistaken. If antitrust takes on tech as an appetizer, there are plenty of other concentrated industries, from cable to cosmetics, banking to eyewear, oil to chickens, for them to enjoy for dinner.

&lt;h1&gt;How the filibuster dies (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/22/not-with-a-bang/#theory-of-change"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I am, frankly, afraid of what's going to happen in the 2022 midterm elections. If the GOP block the Dems from passing any legislation - even the Jan 6 Commission bill! - then it's going to be very hard to mobilize millions of habitual non-voters to show up for the midterms.
And at least one of those bills - HR1, the "For the People Act" - has to pass soon if we're going to head off possibly irreversible voter suppression that will require Democrats to win even-larger supermajorities to win office.
The 2020 elections - and the shambles in Arizona - highlighted just how much of US national politics is controlled by the states.
If you think that the GOP Congressional caucus is unhinged, you don't wanna see what's going on in the state parties:
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7ed9y/trump-election-conspiracy-theories-taking-over-republican-party"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7ed9y/trump-election-conspiracy-theories-taking-over-republican-party&lt;/a&gt;
With a razor-thin hold on the Senate, the Dems need bold action and unity to pass HR1.  But establishment Dems like Manchin and Sinema act like their path to re-election requires them to sabotage the Dems on core issues like the $15 minimum wage.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/27/bruno-argento/#crisis-of-legitimacy"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/27/bruno-argento/#crisis-of-legitimacy&lt;/a&gt;
Manchin's commitment to keeping the filibuster makes him into a de facto agent of the GOP, inasmuch as this means that he can single-handedly prevent the Dems from materially improving the lives of tens of millions of Americans.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#entryism"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#entryism&lt;/a&gt;
Manchin has publicly pledged to destroy the Dems' midterm chances - and forseeable future - by defending the filibuster. This utterly disheartens me. With the US is on the cusp of either charting a new path, or collapsing into autocracy, this is no time for decorum.
But this morning, I read a post by Ryan Grim that gave me hope. Grim starts from the undeniable observation that when a thing doesn't happen immediately, it's easy to think it'll never happen. But history tells us that things do, indeed, &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;a href="https://badnews.substack.com/p/how-the-filibuster-goes-down"&gt;https://badnews.substack.com/p/how-the-filibuster-goes-down&lt;/a&gt;
He cites Adam Jentleson's KILL SWITCH, a 2021 history of the Senate and its rules, including the filibuster, as a means of defending the country's premier undemocratic, anti-majoritarian institution.
&lt;a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781631497773"&gt;https://wwnorton.com/books/9781631497773&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="The cover of Adam Jentleson's KILL SWITCH from WW Norton." src="https://craphound.com/images/kill-switch-the-rise-of-the-modern-senate-and-the-crippling-of-american-democracy.jpg"/&gt;
Jentleson lays out the path to change as a three act structure. In Act I, the filibuster moves from an obscure issue to something that Dems and the Dem Senate caucus are talking about, with all-round recognition that the filibuster is broken.
That's already happened: even Manchin has supported reinstating the "talking filibuster" (the Mr-Smith-Goes-to-Washington version).
Next is Act II, in which the GOP illustrates that merely reforming the filibuster will do no good, because they are so intransigent that there is no place for comity in the chamber.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/30/meme-stocks/#comity"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/30/meme-stocks/#comity&lt;/a&gt;
The GOP's certainly doing everything it can to hasten Act II along.
I mean, McConnell publicly announced his intention to operate in bad faith to kill the Dems' agenda - the same threat that Obama failed to take seriously in 2009 -  and he's backed up his words with deeds.
The GOP's indefensible reversal on the Jan 6 Commission is gift-wrapped proof that they cannot be negotiated with. If the GOP is blocking an investigation into a lynch-mob that came within a whisker of murdering &lt;em&gt;Mike Pence&lt;/em&gt;, what &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; they block?
&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/554743-ocasio-cortez-60-seconds-difference-on-jan-6-could-have-ended-in-a-martial"&gt;https://thehill.com/homenews/house/554743-ocasio-cortez-60-seconds-difference-on-jan-6-could-have-ended-in-a-martial&lt;/a&gt;
If Senate Republicans filibuster the Jan 6 Commission bill, they'll make the case for killing the filibuster more clearly than any Democrat could. Manchin is on record as saying "I’m still praying we’ve still got 10 good solid patriots" among the GOP Senators.
This is Manchin signalling that he might bend on the filibuster, if the GOP force him to.
Grim: "If he’s forced to for the good of the country, because there aren’t enough good solid patriots willing to put that country first, well...The filibuster is not a suicide pact."
Grim thinks that this could happen as early as next week, when the Senate votes on whether to proceed with the Jan 6 Commission. If that happens, we'll move on to Act III.
Act III is the fight over what replaces the filibuster - what the new rules will be. This is the GOP's last chance to save the filibuster, if ten GOP Senators will vote in favor of the commission, end the crisis, and take filibuster reform off the table.
That's what usually happens when the Senate gets to this point. It might happen again. But even if the GOP saves the filibuster this time, the crisis itself will have given Manchin the political cover - and personal experience - to consider killing the filibuster &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; time.
"If the option is a global financial crisis or a vote to reform the filibuster in order to raise the debt ceiling, the choice even for Manchin is an obvious one: ditch the filibuster. That would be the final act of the play. "
Killing the filibuster is key to giving us HR1, the PRO Act, health care reform and a $15 minimum wage. And once Dems start making laws, the GOP obstruction plan becomes counterproductive: simply shouting &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; to everything means GOP Senators deny themselves any say.
Grim: "Ending the filibuster is far more likely to bring on bipartisanship than keeping it."

&lt;h1&gt;Grace is going home (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/01/set-healthy-boundaries/#grace-freed"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
A Black Michigan teen with ADHD who was imprisoned for not doing her homework during the lockdown has been ordered released to her mother, after months of incarceration.
&lt;a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2020/07/31/oakland-co-girl-jailed-not-doing-homework-ordered-release/5557997002/"&gt;https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2020/07/31/oakland-co-girl-jailed-not-doing-homework-ordered-release/5557997002/&lt;/a&gt;
Grace was on parole for briefly stealing a classmate's phone; Mary Ellen Brennan (a judge facing reelection this year) decided missing homework constituted a serious enough parole violation that it warranted a long term custodial sentence.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/15/3-frauds-in-a-trenchcoat/#judge-mary-ellen-brennan"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/15/3-frauds-in-a-trenchcoat/#judge-mary-ellen-brennan&lt;/a&gt;
Grace was imprisoned after an in-person hearing that her defense counsel deemed too dangerous to attend in person. Brennan held the hearing anyway, then, after public outcry, held a second hearing at which she affirmed her decision to imprison Grace.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/21/the-thief-of-joy/#grace"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/21/the-thief-of-joy/#grace&lt;/a&gt;
Brennan's rationale for Grace's imprisonment was that the juvenile facility would help her get the education she was missing at home and also help resolve her friction with her mother.
Brennan maintained this despite testimony from Grace's teachers and school board officials, and despite the factual record: Grace's prison education consisted of filling in photocopied worksheets; her counseling amounted to a few minutes per week of videoconferencing.
Many Michigan members of Congress and other elected officials urged Brennan to reconsider, as did the local prosecutor. Hundreds of local students marched in support of Grace.
Today, the appeals court ordered Grace released into her mother's custody "pending appeal or further order of this court." She will be confined to home and tethered to a GPS cuff.

Brennan is up for re-election in a few months. She ran unopposed in her last election.
She is a garbage person.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/mexico-copyright-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A deep dive into Mexico's new copyright law (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/01/set-healthy-boundaries/#la-ley"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
For the past ten days, I've written extensively about Mexico's new copyright law, a law that copy-pastes the US copyright system, enacted with no consultation or debate, nominally to satisfy requirements under Donald Trump's USMCA agreement.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy&lt;/a&gt;
The law is a disaster for human rights, undermining free speech, the rights of disabled people, cybersecurity, national sovereignty, the Right to Repair, and other fundamental rights - it puts Mexico at a permanent, structural disadvantage relative to Canada and the US.
Like the US law it copies, the new law has numerous, seemingly reasonable exemptions that, superficially at least, appear to resolve these human rights issues. However, these are tissue-thin pretenses, unusably larded with conditions no one could satisfy.
We know this, because the US law they're copied from has been in place for 22 years, and in that time, &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; has been able to invoke these exemptions successfully. They are needles designed to be unthreadable, even by the most innocent and blameless of defendants.
My colleague, EFF Senior Attorney April Walsh, knows more about US copyright law and digital rights than almost anyone else in the world, and she has published a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; detailed analysis of the new Mexican law, drawing on her vast knowledge.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legal-deep-dive-mexicos-disastrous-new-copyright-law"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legal-deep-dive-mexicos-disastrous-new-copyright-law&lt;/a&gt;
This deep dive represents not just the first public translation of the law into English, but also the best, closest analysis of the law to date (her analysis is currently in translation and will be published soon, likely today).
Today is the final day for Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights to take action on the law, and if you are Mexican or in Mexico, you can petition them to take it up:
&lt;a href="https://participa.nicensuranicandados.org/"&gt;https://participa.nicensuranicandados.org/&lt;/a&gt;
But even if the Commission fails to act, the fight isn't over. As the people and businesses of Mexico have awakened to the hidden dangers of this law, pressure is growing for Congress to revisit it, and court cases are being planned.
If there was ever any doubt that digital rights were inseparable from human rights, surely the pandemic - which relegated our whole lives to the digital realm - has erased it. Organizations like R3D and Derechos Digital are leading the fight in Mexico.
Mexico's lawmakers have a duty to put their people's human rights ahead of the greed and venality of US-based multinationals. This issue will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go away.

&lt;h1&gt;The Tree Who Set Healthy Boundaries (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/01/set-healthy-boundaries/#boundaries"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Shel Silverstein was a hell of a writer. I mean, I thought so even before George RR Martin told me about "Uncle Shelby's ABZs" - a fantastically rude and incredible hilarious parody of a kid's book.
&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/09/28/shel-silversteins-filthy-not.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2016/09/28/shel-silversteins-filthy-not.html&lt;/a&gt;
One of the marks of a great writer is that they can sell terrible things so well that you don't even notice that you're buying them. Take "The Giving Tree," a Silverstein book that should be a cautionary tale but is generally read as a suggestion.
In "The Tree Who Set Healthy Boundaries," Topher Payne rewrites the ending of "Giving Tree" to unpick the expert, Silversteinien knot of shitty ideas tied so well that you can easily miss them.
&lt;a href="https://www.topherpayne.com/giving-tree"&gt;https://www.topherpayne.com/giving-tree&lt;/a&gt;
Not only is this hilarious stuff, it's also incredibly, &lt;em&gt;viscerally&lt;/em&gt; satisfying, as the tree tells off the boy for being such a colossal asshole.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/91bb14_a363ecc27a1a4c3fa2df8f2b2da0fe77~mv2.jpg"/&gt;
And Payne brings it in for a hell of a landing!

It's also as strong an argument as you could ask for in favor of fair use, and the presumption that critical remix is - and always should be - fair use. Thankfully, this is a principle that the US Supreme Court has upheld.

&lt;a name="healthy-populism"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/populist-ticket-1024x602.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Populism is good for your health (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/01/set-healthy-boundaries/#healthy-populism"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Back in 2016, Thomas Frank_'s "Listen, Liberal!" forcefully explained that "liberals" are not leftists, and that while we on the left might sometimes ally with liberals, we are not on the same side.
&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781627795395"&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781627795395&lt;/a&gt;
This is something that most of the world outside of the USA knows, but the USA has largely forgotten. I'll never forget my first day of university in the US, when a classmate told me I had "liberal" views; having grown up in Canada's NDP, I knew the difference!
In the US, this manifests as excessive credit for Donald Trump - AKA excessive blame for Donald Trump - as though he was bright enough and had enough executive function to be a cause, rather than an effect.
If you're impressed by the Lincoln Project - a collection of war criminals and grifters from the Reagan and GWB administration and former Romney campaign backers - you're probably a liberal.
If you think that those guys should be dragged in front of an American Nuremberg Trial for their role in dirty wars and Forever Wars; mass incarceration, mass deportation and mass surveillance; financial fraud, torture and worse, you're probably a leftist.
The Lincoln Project doesn't object to Trump's most substantive policies - they just want them executed in ways that don't say the quiet part out loud - they don't care if the rich shit on the rest of us, they just abhor gold-plated toilets as unforgivably gauche.
Writing in Le Monde (and, tellingly, not in a US publication), Frank describes the role that America's dysfunctional, profiteering, world-trailing health care system played in the pandemic (recall that the DNC just voted &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; Medicare For All).
&lt;a href="https://mondediplo.com/2020/08/02populism-expertise"&gt;https://mondediplo.com/2020/08/02populism-expertise&lt;/a&gt;
Liberals didn't turn pandemic into a culture war with mask-refusal and astroturf "reopen" protests, but they legitimized it when they overweighted the role that the recklessness of GOP science-refusal played in the pandemic's spread --
-- and underweighted the role the broken health-care system played. My hometown of LA is not a hotbed of plague because of mask-refusal; the major spread events are in unsafe businesses where precarious workers can't afford health care and can't risk narcing on their boss.
Meanwhile, anti-science mask-refusers AND pro-universal-health-care activists (who are following the undeniable scientific conclusion that universal care is cheaper and better) are both lumped together as "populists" and dismissed by liberal and conservative establishments.
As Frank describes, the origins of American populism are in a decidedly pro-science movement: "Populists produced homages to technology and scholarship and education that were so earnest and ornate that they are embarrassing to read today."
These pops fought the establishment, who leaned on pseudoscience to declare the status quo as ordained by the inevitable forces of "scientific economics," which decreed that only the "best" people could hope for a decent life.
By the 1930s, health care was a flashpoint for populism. Frank tells the story of the medical co-op of Elk City, OK,  "in which farm families would pay a modest sum each year for guaranteed access to doctors, dentists and a modern regional hospital."
Elk Point was fought tooth-and-nail by the AMA, which declared war on the co-op's doctor, the socialist Lebanese immigrant Michael Shadid, who called himself a "Doctor for the People" and believed that health care part of America's bulwark against dictatorship.
The AMA tried to revoke Shadid's license, excluded him from AMA membership (and thus malpractice insurance) and warned other doctors that they'd be blackballed if they went to work with him.
As Frank says, this was not a "popular war on science" - it was "science's war on populism." That is, the ruling class, having cloaked itself in "scientific economics" declared those who upheld more durable (and urgent) scientific truths public enemies and waged war on them.
The AMA - whose wealthy members were certainly part of the ruling class - boycotted orgs that researched "medical economics," threatened reprisals against doctors who tried to repeat the Elk Point experiment, and denounced any Congressional investigations of these tactics.
When a federal inquiry into the AMA's anti-co-op activity convened in 1938, AMA's president rejected it: "That is not scientific medicine and that is not scientific economics."
As Frank says, the AMA's position was that government oversight was "a perversion of the social hierarchy, with the laity demanding some quack remedy and bawling that the experts must prescribe it to him."
And when Truman won in 1948 on a promise of universal healthcare, the AMA called such care the "discredited system of decadent nations" and raised a special warchest from its wealthy members to pay the pioneering Campaigns, Inc to run a propaganda campaign against it.
When Canada's CCF - precursor to the NDP - created the first medicare system in Saskatchewan in 62, doctors walked off the job en masse, and SK doctors raised their own warchest to fight universal access to care.
They were backed by a suspicious, far-right org called "Keep Our Doctors" that appeared out of nowhere and fought medicare "by means of public demonstrations, red-baiting, and racist innuendo."
Thomas holds this up as an example of a "democracy scare": "in which society’s high-status groups come to believe that their privileges have been placed in mortal danger by the actions of the vast, seething multitude."
Democracy scares have popped up whenever left populism arose in America, from William Jennings Bryan to FDR. What was at stake wasn't science, it was privilege: the conversion of health-care from an industry that enriched its backers to a human right.
Opponents of Saskatechewan's medical system called it "a battle for the professional men in this era of mobocracy," and warned that we were moving from a world where everyone knew their place to a world who's motto was "I'm as good as you are."
Populism was leftist. As Steven Brust explained to me, all you need to ask to cleave left from right is: "What's more important: human rights or property rights?" Anyone who says, "property rights are human rights" is not on the left (I used this in Walkaway).
Or as Corey Robin says in The Reactionary Mind, the unifier of all rightwing schools of thought - from eugenics to dominionism to imperialism to libertarianism - is the belief that some people are innately better than others, and they should rule.
&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001"&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001&lt;/a&gt;
Democrats are not a leftists. Frank: they're "the bought-and-paid-for vehicle of affluent and highly educated professionals. It dutifully bails out the geniuses on Wall Street. It responsibly obeys the economists who tell us about the wonders of ‘free trade.’"
"And when our modern Democrats propose healthcare reform, they do it from the top down, by convening experts from every affected field and asking them to redraw the system amongst themselves — and then are astonished when the public erupts in outrage."
Today, private-equity backed, highly concentrated hospital chains and pharma companies have taken over the AMA's role in fighting universal healthcare, and the Dem establishment dismisses M4A advocates as "populists" and lumps them in with Trump-addled mask-deniers.
This ideology locates the world's problems in the unruliness of The People: "Democracy is a problem, they tell us, because democracy allows the common people to ignore the authority of expertise. Disobedient democracy is to blame for Trump."
"Disobedient democracy is why we can do nothing about global warming. Disobedient democracy is the reason we can’t beat the Covid pandemic. And all of it is the fault of We the People."
But The People aren't the reason that we don't have universal testing, that we haven't hired an army of contact tracers, that workers fear reprisals if they reveal their unsafe working conditions, which breed and spread pandemic.
We The People aren't why we don't have universal healthcare, they're not why we aren't paying people to stay home or stemming the tide of evictions. The policies that created the pandemic disaster aren't Trumpist aberrations, they're mainstream Republicanism.
They're the Republicanism of the Lincoln Project, which supported consolidation in pharma and healthcare, erosion of workers' rights and health and safety regulation.
And they're the policies of the mainstream of the Democrats, too: the brutal austerity of Pelosi's Paygo and Brooker's votes against taming the pharma industry.
Trump's criminal, lethal mismanagement of the pandemic would have slaughtered Americans by the tens of thousands regardless of this, of course - but hundreds of thousands more would have been spared infection, eviction and death if it wasn't for the system he presides over.
He didn't make that system, and the professionalized, elite-worshipping DNC won't unmake it. As Frank says, "In our awful current situation, a dose of authentic populism would be a remarkable tonic."

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/interoperable-2.png"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Interoperability and privacy (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/11/1-in-3/#interoperable"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Today, as part of its Tech Policy Greenhouse, Techdirt has published my essay "Interoperability And Privacy: Squaring The Circle": how forcing services to allow users to move freely and exchange messages between rivals can be good for privacy.
&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200609/13350244675/interoperability-privacy-squaring-circle.shtml"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200609/13350244675/interoperability-privacy-squaring-circle.shtml&lt;/a&gt;
Big Tech companies say that if they're required to let users of rival services to send messages to their own users, this makes it harder for them  to police their users' conduct - if they can't spy on user activity, it will be harder to automatically spot harassment (say).
But this only matters to the extent that we believe that companies like Facebook have  both the will and the technical capacity to monitor 2.5 billion users' activities and stop the bad stuff from happening. Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated that we shouldn't believe that.
Nor is it enough to let companies adopt standards and claim they are now "interoperable." As anyone who's worked in standardization knows, it's easy for big companies who dominate their industry to ensure that standards confer lasting advantages to them at others' expense.
Instead, we should look to Adversarial Interoperability, when a new a product or service is connected to an existing one, without permission, in order to benefit the existing service's users.
When paired with standards, Adversarial Interop serves as an escape hatch that stops dominant companies from using standards to crush their rivals: whenever the standard falls short, rivals can just plug their stuff into the company's products without permission.
Ultimately, interoperability is only bad for privacy if you trust the tech platforms to get privacy right, and they have not earned that trust.
Interoperability means when a platform doesn't deserve your trust, you can use a rival's tool to seize your privacy, rather than groveling for it.
"Helping Facebook's own users, or the users of any big service, to configure their experience to make their lives better should be legal and encouraged even if it provides a path for users to either diversify their social media. Either way, we'd be on our way to a more pluralistic, decentralized, diverse Internet."

&lt;h1&gt;The true US police body-count (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/11/1-in-3/#1-in-3"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Human Rights Data Analysis Group does incredible human rights work by using rigorous statistical methods to piece together fragmentary evidence of genocides to extrapolate the full scope of the crimes, for use in international tribuals.
&lt;a href="https://hrdag.org"&gt;https://hrdag.org&lt;/a&gt;
America resembles these nations gripped by genocide in that we have a source of mass killings (deaths at the hands of police) and no reliable source that counts them all.
In 2015, Kristian Lum and Patrick Ball used techniques they'd used in Guatemala, Syria and Kosovo - to count Americans killed by cops.
The open-access paper explains their methods and conclusions and is a beautiful piece of scientific communications.
&lt;a href="https://hrdag.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2015-hrdag-estimating-undoc-homicides.pdf"&gt;https://hrdag.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2015-hrdag-estimating-undoc-homicides.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
At the time, they also published a layperson-friendly Granta article explaining these methods for non-statisticians, and in so doing, explained why all the official attempts to count the dead had underestimated the body count.
Ball's 2015 conclusion is cops kill about 1500 of us every year. "1500 police homicides/year would mean that 8-10% of all US homicide victims are killed by police. Of all US homicide victims killed by people they don’t know, approximately 1/3 of them are victims of police."
HRDAG's work has been incredibly important for my understanding of this crisis. Their early analysis of the first covid-19 studies was indepensible:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/15/denominators-matter/#denominators-matter"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/15/denominators-matter/#denominators-matter&lt;/a&gt;
And I think about their primer on Bayesian reasoning and covid test-reliability comes up literally every day.

&lt;a name="boost-50"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Sanstitre_16_800x.png"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tesla modder selling discounted upgrades (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/11/1-in-3/#boost-50"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Guillaume André, owner of the EV repair/resale store Simon André in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, has developed the "Boost 50," a product that unlocks a bunch of premium modes in Tesla Model 3 cars.
&lt;a href="https://ingenext.ca/products/boost-50"&gt;https://ingenext.ca/products/boost-50&lt;/a&gt;
For $1100, the Boost 50 unlocks the 50hp boost that Tesla charges $2k for, only Boost 50's performance beats Tesla's in-built one, and it comes with "Drift mode" and other features not offered at all by Tesla.
Boost 50 is a software-only upgrade you can perform yourself. Ingenext - the company André founded to market these aftermarket upgrades have plans to offer more ambitious products that would require professional installation.
&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/06/10/tesla-hacker-unlocks-performance-upgrade-acceleration-boost/"&gt;https://electrek.co/2020/06/10/tesla-hacker-unlocks-performance-upgrade-acceleration-boost/&lt;/a&gt;
Under Section 1201 of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, "trafficking" in a tool that bypasses an "access control" for a copyrighted work (like the Tesla's firmware) is a felony punishable by a 5-year prison sentence and a $500k fine.
These apply irrespective of whether any copyright is violated - just selling a tool that bypasses an access control is a crime.
Canada's Bill C-11 (2011) is spookily similar, and its main boosters, Tony Clement and James Moore, both explicitly said that they wanted a bill that criminalized people who modified their own property, even if they didn't violate anyone's copyright.
It remains to be seen whether an (inevitable) attempt by Tesla to shut down M. André's store would have legal force under C-11, though.
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a name="oppenheimers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/frcropped-mlk_mugshot_birmingham.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Amazon won't sell facial recognition to cops (for a year) (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/11/1-in-3/#oppenheimers"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Amazon has announced a one-year moratorium on the sale of #Rekognition, its facial recognition tool, to US law-enforcement.
&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52989128"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52989128&lt;/a&gt;
The company has renewed its call for Congress to pass laws regulating FR technology. A charitable interpretation of this call is that the company is genuinely concerned with the abuse of its tools.
However, if that's true, it could voluntarily withdraw its products from customers like ICE and law enforcement.
A more realistic take is that the company wants to have an external authority it can appeal to when it is accused of unethical conduct.
That is, "We're just doing what Congress told us to do."
And of course, federal laws mean that any forbearance from Amazon in its sales to cops will not disadvantage it relative to less ethical rivals.
Some opponents of sales of FR to law enforcement stress that FR systems have well-understood biases (stemming from poor training data) that make it less reliable when asked to recognize Black and brown faces.
However, as I wrote when IBM pulled out of the facial recognition business a couple days ago, this is a dangerously incomplete critique.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/09/war-crimes/#big-blue"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/09/war-crimes/#big-blue&lt;/a&gt;
Because if the main problem with FR is that it fails to recognize racialized peoples' faces, then the answer is to feed FR systems with new training pictures of PoCs until it is highly accurate at recognizing them.
Which is to say, until the police have a perfect tool for tracking and identifying people of color.
That's what happened in China, where tech giants fixed their Black FR problem by requisitioning the entire Zimbabwean drivers' license database.
&lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/24/beijings-big-brother-tech-needs-african-faces/"&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/24/beijings-big-brother-tech-needs-african-faces/&lt;/a&gt;
Today, Chinese state security can use FR to reliably identify and track African faces within China (and they can sell this capability to African states that are entering into debtor relationships with China to acquire tech capacity).
This is hardly a bright spot for racial equality.
The problem with FR for law enforcement is that it sets up a high-tech totalitarian surveillance state: not that it fails to recognize Black faces well enough.

&lt;h1&gt;Naomi Novik's incredible, brilliant, stupendous "Temeraire" series (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/08/temeraire/#but-i-am-napoleon"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
One of the finest pleasures in life is to discover a complete series of novels as an adult, to devour them right through to the end, and to arrive at that ending to discover that, while you'd have happily inhabited the author's world for many more volumes, you are &lt;em&gt;eminently&lt;/em&gt; satisfied with the series' conclusion.
I just had this experience and I am still basking in the warm glow of having had such a thoroughly fulfilling imaginary demi-life for half a year. I'm speaking of the nine volumes in Naomi Novik's Temeraire series, which reimagines the NapoleonicWars in a world that humans share with enormous, powerful, intelligent dragons.
&lt;a href="https://www.naominovik.com/temeraire/"&gt;https://www.naominovik.com/temeraire/&lt;/a&gt;
If you are like me, this may not sound like your kind of thing, but please, read on! Novik is a gifted, brilliant storyteller, and even if you, like me, had never read a tale of naval or aerial battles that didn't bore you to tears, you should &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; read these books, because I have never been so gripped by action sequences as I was by Novik's massive military set-pieces.
Likewise, if you're not a fan of dragon fiction - I'm not, though I do enjoy some heroic fantasy - or talking animal stories (ditto), you owe it to yourself to read these books! Novik's dragons straddle the line between fantasy and sf, with decidedly nonmagical, bioscience- and physics-grounded characteristics. In the hands of a lesser writer, this can be deadly, yielding an imaginary creature that is neither fantastic nor believable.
But Novik's deft handling of her dragons - variegated in biological characteristics, sociological arrangements, and umwelt - renders them as creatures both majestic &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; relatable, decidedly inhuman in outlook but also intensely likeable characters that you root for (or facepalm over, or sometimes both - a delicious sweet-sour cocktail of emotions!).
Finally, if you're not a fan of historical fiction - again, as I am not! - you should absolutely get these books. Novik is an exhaustive researcher with a gift for rendering the people and circumstances of the past simultaneously comprehensible and unmistakably &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;, making the past "a different country" indeed, but nevertheless a place whose contours can be firmly grasped and inhabited.
In other words, Novik has written a work of historical-military fiction with dragons in it that I enjoyed, despite having almost no interest in historical fiction, military fiction, or high fantasy. She did this by means of the simple trick of being consistently and variously brilliant in her execution.
First, she is brilliant in the themes that run through these nine volumes: the themes of honor, duty and love, and the impossible dilemmas that arise from trying to be true to yourself and others. Captain William Laurence - the sea captain who finds himself abruptly moved into the dragon corps - is a profoundly honorable man, bound by the strictest of mores. Nominally, Laurence's moral code is shared by his fellow gentlemen and officers, but where most of the world - all the way up to the Lords of the Admiralty - pays lip service to this code, Laurence truly believes in it.
But there is something of Gödel's Incompleteness in Laurence's Georgian morality, in that to be completely true to his ethics, Laurence must - again and again, in ways large and small - also &lt;em&gt;violate&lt;/em&gt; his ethics, often with the most extreme consequences imaginable at stake. Novik spends nine volumes destruction-testing Laurence's morality, in a series of hypotheticals of the sort that you could easily spend years arguing over in a philosophy of ethics seminar - but these aren't dry academic questions, they're the stuff of fabulous adventure, great battles, hair's-breadth escapes, and daring rescues.
Next, there is Novik's historical sense, which is broad, deep, and also brilliantly speculative. Novik has painstakingly researched the historical circumstances of all parts of Napoleonic Europe, but also the Inca empire, colonial Africa, settler Australia, late-Qing China, and Meiji Japan.
It would be one thing if Novik merely brought these places and times to life with perfect verisimilitude, but Novik goes further. She has reimagined how all of these societies would have developed in the presence of massive, powerful, intelligent dragons - how their power structures would relate to dragons, and how the dragons would have related to colonial conquest.
The result is both a stage that is set for a Napoleonic War that is recognizable but utterly transformed, a set of social &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; strategic speculations that would make for a brilliant West Point grad seminar or tabletop military strategy game or an anticolonial retelling of imperial conquest, but is, instead, the backdrop for nine exciting, world-spanning novels.
Next, there's Novik's action staging. I have the world's worst sense of direction and geometry. I can stay in a hotel for a week and still get lost every time I try to find my room. I can't read maps. I can't visualize 3D objects or solve jigsaw puzzles. Hell, I can barely &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless, I was able to follow every twist and turn of Novik's intricate naval/aerial/infantry battles, often with casts of thousands. Not just follow them! I was utterly captivated by them.
Next, there's Novik's ability to juggle her characters. While these novels follow two main characters - William Laurence and the dragon Temeraire - they are joined by &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of other named characters, from Chinese emperors to the Sapa Inca to Wellington to Napoleon, to say nothing of the dragons, the sea captains, the Japanese lords, the drunken sailors, the brave midshipmen, and so on and so on. Each one of these people is distinct, sharply drawn, necessary to the tale, and strongly individuated. I am in awe (and not a little jealous). Wow. Just wow.
Finally, there's Novik's language: the tale is told primarily through Laurence's point of view, which is rendered in mannered, early 19th century English. Again, this is the kind of thing I usually find either difficult or irritatingly precious or both - but again, it turns out that I just hadn't read anyone who was &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt; at this sort of thing. Novik is &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; good at it.
At the end of one summer, years ago, I ran into Vernor Vinge at a conference and asked him how he was doing. He lit up and told me he'd just had one of the best summers of his adult life, because he'd started it by reading the first Terry Pratchett Discworld novel, and had discovered, stretching before him, &lt;em&gt;dozens&lt;/em&gt; more in the series. It was an experience he hadn't enjoyed since he was a boy, discovering the writers that preceded him.
As I read the Temeraire books, I kept returning to that conversation with Vinge. I listened to the Temeraire books as audiobooks, downloading them from Libro.fm and listening to them on my underwater MP3 player as I swam my daily laps. Simon Vance's narration truly did the series justice, and I could only imagine how complex it must have been for Vance and his director to juggle all the character voices, but they pulled it off beautifully.
I normally read pretty widely, but almost always within a band of themes, settings and modes that I've specialized in. This can be a very satisfying experience, of course. Last year, I read &lt;em&gt;dozens&lt;/em&gt; of fantastic books that were in my wheelhouse, for all that that wheelhouse is an extremely large one:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/01/bookishness/#2022-in-review"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/01/bookishness/#2022-in-review&lt;/a&gt;
But reading &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; type, outside of one's comfort zone, yields new and distinct delights. The Temeraire series joins the very short list of heroic fantasy novels that I count among my all-time favorites, along with such marvels as Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos/Jhereg series:
&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2017/10/17/listen-up-you-really-owe-it-to-yourself-to-read-15-vlad-taltos-novels-seriously/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2017/10/17/listen-up-you-really-owe-it-to-yourself-to-read-15-vlad-taltos-novels-seriously/&lt;/a&gt;
Brust is tremblingly close to finishing the Vlad books, which I started reading as a 13 year old and have been devouring ever since. I can't wait for the final volumes to come out, so I can binge-read the whole series from beginning to end.
There are so many good new books coming out every month, and it can feel like a disservice to those writers to indulge in backlist reading, but there is a lot to be said for revisiting beloved works of decades gone by. I am &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; glad to have read Temeraire at last - I haven't been this excited to read something I missed the first time around since I read Red Mars 12 years after its initial publication:

&lt;h1&gt;Crowdfunding an open access jewelry course (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#lioneseelise"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The people are the best thing about a life in science fiction - eclectic, bright, opinionated, talented - people like Elise Mathson: writer, jeweller, and all-round brilliant person (she's up for a Hugo this year).
Matheson's "wandering wire" jewellery is unmistakable - as anyone who's ever bid at a Wiscon auction knows. And as great as she is at making jewellery, she's even better at teaching, much beloved for her patient one-on-one lessons.
But Elise's health issues are making it harder for her to teach, so she's kickstarting a series of high-quality instructional videos that document her methods while she can still work.
&lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lionesselise/wandering-wire-jewelry-videos-with-lionesselise"&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lionesselise/wandering-wire-jewelry-videos-with-lionesselise&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/il_1140xN.2323338322_ol1m.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/il_1140xN.2375750625_crp8.jpg"&gt;
The idea is that these can be shared among students, including students who can't afford to travel, or who have disabilities that make in-person tutelage impractical (they will all have captions). The videos will be limited to backers for a year, and open access thereafter.
With 40 hours to go, Elise has made her funding goal, but is shooting for an ambitious stretch goal: if she hits $25K, she'll make a mini-documentary about her methods, including interviews with the astronomers who inspire her work.

&lt;h1&gt;Bahamas Company Registry leaked (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#ddosecrets"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Distributed Denial of Secrets project publishes leaks that reveal corruption, particularly leaks that undo financial secrecy. They have just released their latest dump: Project X-Ray, a leak of scanned the Bahamas Company Registry.
&lt;a href="https://xray.ddosecrets.com/"&gt;https://xray.ddosecrets.com/&lt;/a&gt;
These are scanned documents - 135,166 in all - that reveal the directors and officers of shell companies, many of them used to hide the looted wealth of poor nations, or funds hidden away by corrupt "businesspeople" evading taxes, or just plain criminals.
They're looking for help transcribing the contents of these records so they can be made fully searchable. Many of these companies are matrioshke grifts, numbered owned by other numbered companies in other notorious secrecy jurisdictions from New Zealand to Delaware.
A previous dump revealed the contents of the Cayman National Bank and Trust, a favored cutout for Russian oligarchs.

&lt;h1&gt;Mafia logic and conservative ideology (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#mafia-logic"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
It's a commonplace that labels like "left" and "right" don't mean anything, but that's not true.
The first clean distinguishing test I ever heard came from  Steven Brust: "Ask what's more important, human rights, or property  rights. If they say property rights are a human right, they're on the right." (I liked this so much I put it in my novel Walkaway)
Then came the definition from Corey Robin's "The Reactionary Mind": to be on the right is to believe that some of us were ordained to rule and the rest to be ruled over, and that the world is only right when the correct rulers are enthroned.

(I liked this so much I put it in my novella "The Masque of the Red Death).

Today, I learned a new definition, courtesy of John Holbo: "Conservatism says the law protects in-group members without binding them; while binding out-group members, not protecting them. Mafia logic all the way up and down."
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jholbo1/status/1264387116982661120"&gt;https://twitter.com/jholbo1/status/1264387116982661120&lt;/a&gt;
This follows perfectly from the second definition. The purpose of the law is to protect the rightful rulers, so the law can't - by definition - punish them. And it is "mafia logic."
Holbo was talking about Michael Gove - a UK Tory Minister - excusing his the Prime Minister's advisor Dominick Cummings repeatedly breaking the quarantine rules that Cummings is responsible for creating and enforcing.
But it could apply equally well to Trump's pardons for his crooked henchmen, or the legions of Karens who think the cops should come and bust some Black kid's head for selling lemonade without a license, while ignoring their own anti-vax playground quarantine-breaking.
It's pure Blue Lives Matter logic: the law should protect cops from Black people, but not Black people from cops. It should punish Black people who break the law, but protect cops who break the law.
There is a meaningful difference between reactionary and progressive, left and right. It's the difference of property rights vs human rights - whether you exact the right to hoard while others starve, or the right not to starve while others hoard.
It's the difference between pluralism and elitism: whether you think some of us were born to be ruled over, or whether you think we should have a government selected by its people to serve those people.
It's the difference of equal protections and duties under the law, as opposed to impunity for the powerful and the legalized oppression of the powerless.

&lt;h1&gt;Podcast: Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town Part 4 (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#sctt"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
My latest podcast is part 4 of my ongoing reading of my novel "Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town," a book Gene Wolfe called "a glorious book unlike any book you’ve ever read.”
&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/podcast/2020/05/24/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town-part-04/"&gt;https://craphound.com/podcast/2020/05/24/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town-part-04/&lt;/a&gt;
In this episode, we meet Kurt, the high tech, crustypunk dumpster-diver who is building a citywide mesh wireless freenet with refurbished e-waste he's pulled out of the trash.
Kurt is based on a real person! Darren Atkinson, a high-tech dumpster-diver who was the subject of my first-ever Wired article. Some of the most memorable nights of my life were spent chest-deep in suburban Toronto dumpsters with Darren.

"Tofu Type" is a web design term for the square boxes that show up in lieu of letters when type is specified in a language for which the font has no glyphs. Google's Noto ("no more tofu") Fonts aims to fix this with character sets for 75 alphabets.
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/"&gt;https://www.google.com/get/noto/&lt;/a&gt;
It's one of many high-quality, open/free fonts from the company. I'm especially fond of their monospace fonts.

Noto is missing a few languages. From the FAQ:

French photographer Jason Guilbeau has used the lockdown to virtually travel through the former USSR with Google Street View, capturing images of Soviet relics and signage. These have been collected in "Soviet Signs and Street Relics," a new book.
&lt;a href="http://fuel-design.com/publishing/soviet-signs-street-relics/"&gt;http://fuel-design.com/publishing/soviet-signs-street-relics/&lt;/a&gt;
The publisher writes, "This collection of photographs portrays a surreal reality: it is a document of a vanishing era, captured by an omniscient technology that is continually deleting and replenishing itself – an inadvertent definition of Russia today."

I love this kind of exuberant relic, these monuments to a vanished past of promise and progress; first, because they remind me of the strange gifts my great-grandparents would bring when they came from Leningrad to Toronto for visits in the 70s and 80s.
And second, because they are forceful reminders of the fragility of hegemony - the fact that a society is busily sticking up giant monuments to its durability in no way indicates whether it is, indeed, durable.
One of the most striking passages in OCTOBER, China Mieville's novelistic history of the Russian Revolution, deals with the events leading up to the revolution, a series of minor peasant uprisings that were put down with overwhelming shows of force.
Many revolutionary strategists took this to be an indication of the Czar's strength: why would a Czar squander all this military might for these insignificant uprisings in the outer provinces? Imagine how he'll deal with a real revolution!
But it turned out that the reason that the Czar was so dedicated to stamping out the most insignificant embers of rebellion is that he knew he was surrounded by dry tinder, and a single spark could send his empire up in flames.
Reading it, I was struck by the underlying lesson: that the behavior of autocrats at their top strength is indistinguishable - from the outside - from their behavior when their strength is at its lowest ebb.
The Trump administration embodies this principle - every time Trump does something arrogant and overreaching, the sort of thing you'd expect of an autocrat with power to burn, it emerges that his motivation was a bluffer's desperation.
Crumbling Soviet monuments are mementos mori, the skull on your desk that reminds you that this too shall pass.

&lt;h1&gt;Rogue UK civil service tweet damns "truth-twisters" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#stiff-upper"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's top advisor, Dominic Cummings, violated the quarantine rules he'd personally overseen and drove 264 miles to his parents' "estate" while his wife was ill with coronavirus.
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/boris-johnson-faces-renewed-tory-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/boris-johnson-faces-renewed-tory-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings&lt;/a&gt;
Not only that: Cummings is credibly accused of repeatedly violating his own public health measures.
What's more, Johnson "vigorosly defended" this conduct in a "sometimes extraordinary" press conference.
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/can-you-imagine-having-to-work-with-these-truth-twisters"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/can-you-imagine-having-to-work-with-these-truth-twisters&lt;/a&gt;
This presser appears was the final straw for the manager of the @UKCivilService Twitter account, which posted, "Arrogant and offensive. Can you imagine having to work with these truth twisters?”
The tweet was quickly deleted but was still shared tens of thousands of times.
The UK Cabinet Office account later tweeted "An unauthorised tweet was posted on a government channel this evening. The post has been removed and we are investigating the matter."

Whenever I talk about protections for "adversarial interoperability" (allowing third parties to service, extend, improve existing products) someone will inevitably say that the legal right to mod a product is irrelevant because companies like Apple make impregnable products.
But when it comes to security, attacking is easier than defending. For Apple to fend off third-party app stores or other products that give its customers more rights to their property, Apple needs to be perfect. To defeat this, third parties only need to find a single error.
This principle keeps getting proved. A new jailbreak from the unc0ver team works on every Iphone and every version of Ios, including version 13.5, only released this week.
&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/hackers-iphone-new-jailbreak/"&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/hackers-iphone-new-jailbreak/&lt;/a&gt;
This is in addition to Axi0mx's "Checkm8" crack, which exploits a defect in a security component that Apple designed not to be modified after manufacture, meaning that any patch from Apple would require de/resoldering a tamper-resistant component.
&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/09/developer-of-checkm8-explains-why-idevice-jailbreak-exploit-is-a-game-changer/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/09/developer-of-checkm8-explains-why-idevice-jailbreak-exploit-is-a-game-changer/&lt;/a&gt;
Checkm8 is a forever-day bug that affects 11 years' worth of Iphone models, though not the most recent ones.

&lt;h1&gt;Texas Instruments locks down its hackable calculators (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#technological-self-determination"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In a deceptive software update, Texas Instruments removed a popular feature from its bestselling TI-84 graphing calculators, removing the ability of calculator owners to write and run their own C and assembler programs.
&lt;a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16652"&gt;https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16652&lt;/a&gt;
The change was blamed on "exam boards and teachers" who'd been inflamed by "sensationalized videos" that showed how homebrew software could help students cheat during exams.
Peter Balyta, Texas Instruments' President of Educational Technology, called the move "a difficult decision, but one that was made out of an abundance of caution to prioritize learning for students and minimize any security risks."
The practice of using deceptive software updates to remove desirable features from products after they have been sold is an incredibly bad idea. Regular software updating is the key to technological "herd immunity."
The failure to patch devices is largely to blame for Denial of Service epidemics, and compromised systems can be used as a jumping-off point for attacks on other systems. As a technologically dependent civilization, we cannot afford to disincentivize people from updating.
The first time I encountered this tactic was with Apple's Itunes, which went through a multi-year period of deceptive updates that removed desirable functionality to please the record companies whose approval was needed to keep the Itunes Store in business.
More recently, HP pushed a fake "security update" to its printers that lay dormant for six months, then activated and began blocking third-party/remanufactured ink cartridges.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers&lt;/a&gt;
It's such a reckless act, a poisoning of the well, like Trump's attempt to use the US census to gather citizenship data or the CIA's impersonation of public health workers when they were searching for Osama bin Laden.
These practices are essential to our common wellbeing, and rely heavily on voluntary cooperation. Teaching people that participating in these actions - whose benefits are not personal, but rather distributed across our whole society - is an act of depraved indifference.

&lt;img alt="The title page of Richard Hofstadter's 'Paranoid Style in American Politics' from the November, 1964 issue of Harper's Magazine. A John Birch Society pin reading 'This is REPUBLIC not a DEMOCRACY: let's keep it that way' sits atop the page, obscuring the introductory paragraph." src="https://craphound.com/images/paranoid-style-in-american-politicss.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conservatives are fringe outliers - and leftists could learn from them (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/16/that-boy-aint-right/#dinos-rinos-and-dunnos"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The Republican Party, a coalition between Big Business farmers and turkeys who'll vote for Christmas (Red Scare obsessed cowards, apocalyptic white nationalists, religious fanatics, etc) has fallen to its bizarre, violent, noisy radical wing, who are obsessed with policies that are completely irrelevant to the majority of Americans.
As Oliver Willis writes, the views of the radical right - which are also the policies of the GOP - are wildly out of step with the US political view:
&lt;a href="https://www.oliverexplains.com/p/conservatives-arent-like-normal-americans"&gt;https://www.oliverexplains.com/p/conservatives-arent-like-normal-americans&lt;/a&gt;
The press likes to frame American politics as "narrowly divided," but the reality is that Republicans' electoral victories are due to voter suppression and antimajoritarian institutions (the Senate and Electoral College, etc), not popularity. Democrats consistently outperform the GOP in national races. Dems won majorities in 1992/6, and beat the GOP in 2000, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020. The only presidential race the GOP won on popular votes &lt;em&gt;since 1988&lt;/em&gt; was 2004, when GW Bush eked out a plurality (not a majority).
But, as Willis says, Dems "act like it is 1984 and that they are outliers in a nation of Reagan voters," echoing a stilted media narrative. The GOP's platform just isn't popular. Take the groomer panic: 71% of Americans approve of same-sex marriage. The people losing their shit about queer people are a strange, tiny minority.
Every one of the GOP's tentpole issues is wildly unpopular: expanding access to assault rifles, banning immigration, lowering taxes on the rich, cutting social programs, forcing pregnant people to bear unwanted children, etc. This is true all the way up to the GOP's coalescing support for Trump as their 2024 candidate. Trump has lost every popular vote he's ever stood for, and owes his term in the Oval Office to the antimajoritarian Electoral College system, gerrymandering, and massive voter suppression.
Willis correctly points out that Dem leaders are basically "normal" center-right politicians, not radicals. And, unlike their GOP counterparts, politicians like Clinton, Obama and Biden don't hide their disdain for the radical wing of their party. Even never-Trumper Republicans are afraid of their base. Romney declared himself "severely conservative" and McCain "put scare quotes around 'health of the mother' provisions for abortion rights."
The GOP fringe imposes incredible discipline on their leaders. Take all the nonsense about "woke capitalism": on the one hand, it's absurd to call union-busting, tax-dodging, worker-screwing companies "woke" (even if they sell Pride flags for a couple of weeks every year).
But on the other hand? The GOP leadership have actually &lt;em&gt;declared war&lt;/em&gt; on the biggest corporations in America, to the point that the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; says that "Republicans and Big Business broke up":
&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-corporations-donations-pacs-9b5b202b"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-corporations-donations-pacs-9b5b202b&lt;/a&gt;
But America is a two-party system and there are plenty of people who'll pull the lever for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Republican. This means that when the GOP comes under the control of its swivel-eyed loon wing, the swivel-eyed loons wield power far beyond the number of people who agree with them.
There's an important lesson there for Dems, whose establishment is volubly proud of its independence from its voters. The Biden administration is a weirdly perfect illustration of this "independence." The Biden admin is a kind of referee, doling out policies and appointments to its competing wings, without any coherence or consistency.
That's how you get &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; appointments like Lina Khan at the FTC and Jonathan Kanter at the DoJ Antitrust Division and Rohit Chopra at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureat - the progressive wing of the party bargained for these key appointments and then played their cards very well, getting incredible, hard-charging, hyper-competent fighters in those roles.
Likewise, Jared Bernstein, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; confirmed as Council of Economic Advisers chair after an interminable wrangle:
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2023-06-16-team-biden/"&gt;https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2023-06-16-team-biden/&lt;/a&gt;
And Julie Su, acting labor secretary, who just delivered a six-year contract to west coast dockworkers with 8-10% raises in the first year, paid retroactively for the year they worked without a contract:
&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/14/statement-from-president-biden-on-labor-agreement-at-west-coast-ports/"&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/14/statement-from-president-biden-on-labor-agreement-at-west-coast-ports/&lt;/a&gt;
But the Biden admin's unwillingness to side with one wing of the party also produces catastrophic failures, like the martyrdom of Gigi Sohn, who was subjected to years of vicious personal attacks while awaiting confirmation to the FCC, undefended by the Biden admin, left to twist in the wind until she gave it up as a bad job:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/culture-war-bullshit-stole-your-broadband-4ce1ffb16dc5"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/culture-war-bullshit-stole-your-broadband-4ce1ffb16dc5&lt;/a&gt;
It's how we get key roles filled by do-nothing seatwarmers like Pete Buttigieg, who has the same sweeping powers that Lina Khan is wielding so deftly at the FTC, but who lacks either the will or the skill to wield those same powers at the Department of Transport:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/11/dinah-wont-you-blow/#ecp"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/11/dinah-wont-you-blow/#ecp&lt;/a&gt;
By refusing to stand for anything except a fair division of powers among different Democratic Party blocs, the Biden admin ends up undercutting itself. Take right to repair, a centerpiece of the administration's agenda, subject of a historic executive order and FTC regulation:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/18/administrative-competence/#i-know-stuff"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/18/administrative-competence/#i-know-stuff&lt;/a&gt;
Right to Repair fights have been carried out at the state level for years, with the biggest victory coming in Massachusetts, where an automotive R2R ballot initiative won overwhelming support in 2020:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r&lt;/a&gt;
But despite the massive support for automotive right to repair in the Bay State, Big Car has managed to delay the implementation of the new law for years, tying up the state in expensive, time-consuming litigation:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/26/nixing-the-fix/#r2r"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/26/nixing-the-fix/#r2r&lt;/a&gt;
But eventually, even the most expensive delaying tactic fails. Car manufacturers were set to come under the state right to repair rule this month, but they got a last minute reprieve, from Biden's own National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, who sent urgent letters to every major car manufacturer, telling them to ignore the Massachusetts repair law:
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7bbkv/biden-administration-tells-car-companies-to-ignore-right-to-repair-law-people-overwhelmingly-voted-for"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7bbkv/biden-administration-tells-car-companies-to-ignore-right-to-repair-law-people-overwhelmingly-voted-for&lt;/a&gt;
The NHTSA repeats the car lobby's own scare stories about "cybersecurity" that they blitzed to Massachusetts voters in the runup to the ballot initiative:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/03/rip-david-graeber/#rolling-surveillance-platforms&lt;/a&gt;
The idea that cybersecurity is best maintained by letting powerful corporations gouge you on service and parts is belied by independent experts, like SecuRepairs, who do important work countering the FUD thrown off by the industry (and parroted by Biden's NHTSA):
&lt;a href="https://securepairs.org/"&gt;https://securepairs.org/&lt;/a&gt;
Independent security experts are clear that letting owners of high-tech devices decide who fixes them, what software they run, etc, makes us safer:
&lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2022/01/letter-to-the-us-senate-judiciary-committee-on-app-stores.html"&gt;https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2022/01/letter-to-the-us-senate-judiciary-committee-on-app-stores.html&lt;/a&gt;
But here we are: the Biden admin is sabotaging the Biden admin, because the Biden admin isn't an administration, it's a system for ensuring proportional representation of different parts of the Democratic Party coalition.
This isn't just bad for policy, it's bad politics, too. It presumes that if some Democratic voters want pizza, and others want hamburgers, that you can please everyone by serving up pizzaburgers. &lt;em&gt;No one&lt;/em&gt; wants a pizzaburger:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/23/narrative-warfare/#giridharadas"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/23/narrative-warfare/#giridharadas&lt;/a&gt;
The failure to deliver a coherent, muscular vision for a climate-ready, anti-Gilded Age America has left the Democrats vulnerable. Because while the radical proposals of the GOP fringe may not enjoy much support, there are &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; majorities of Americans who have lost faith in the status quo and are totally uninterested in the Pizzaburger Party.
Nowhere is this better explained than in Naomi Klein's superb long-form article on RFK Jr's presidential bid in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/ignoring-robert-f-kennedy-jr-not-an-option"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/ignoring-robert-f-kennedy-jr-not-an-option&lt;/a&gt;
Don't get me wrong, RFK Jr is a Very Bad Politician, for all the reasons that Klein lays out. He's an anti-vaxxer, a conspiracist, and his support for ending American military aggression, defending human rights, and addressing the climate emergency is laughably thin.
But as Klein points out, RFK Jr is not peddling pizzaburgers. He is tapping into a legitimate rage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  a great many voters are hurting and rightfully angry: about powerful corporations controlling their democracy and profiting off disease and poverty. About endless wars draining national coffers and maiming their kids. About stagnating wages and soaring costs. This is the world – inflamed on every level – that the two-party duopoly has knowingly created.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
RFK Jr is campaigning against "the corrupt merger between state and corporate power," against drug monopolies setting our national health agenda, and polluters capturing environmental regulators.
As Klein says, despite RFK Jr's willing to say the unsayable, and tap into the yearning among the majority of American voters for something &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;, he's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; running a campaign rooted in finally telling the American public “the truth.” Rather, "public discourse filled with unsayable and unspeakable subjects is fertile territory for all manner of hucksters positioning themselves as uniquely courageous truth tellers."
We've been here before. Remember Trump campaigning against a "rigged system" and promising to "make America great again?" Remember Clinton's rejoinder that "America was already great?" It's hard to imagine a worse response to legitimate outrage - over corporate capture, declining wages and living conditions; and spiraling health, education and shelter costs.
Sure, it was obvious that Trump was a beneficiary of the rigged system, and that he would rig it further, but at least he admitted it was rigged, not "already great."
The Democratic Party is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in thrall to labor unions, or racial equality activists, or people who care about gender justice or the climate emergency. Unlike the GOP, the Dem establishment has figured out how to keep a grip on power within their own party - at the expense of exercising power in America, even when they hold office.
But unlike culture war nonsense, shared prosperity, fairness, care, and sound environmental policies are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; popular in America. Some people have been poisoned against politics altogether and sunk into nihilism, while others have been duped into thinking that America can't afford to look after its people.
In this regard, winning the American electorate is a macrocosm for the way labor activists win union majorities in the workplaces they organize. In her memoir &lt;em&gt;A Collective Bargain&lt;/em&gt;, Jane McAlevey describes how union organizers contend with everything that progressive politicians must overcome. A union drive takes place in the teeth of unfair laws, on a tilted playing field that allows bosses to gerrymander some workers' votes and suppress others' altogether. These bosses have far more resources than the workers, and they spend millions on disinformation campaigns, forcing workers to attend long propaganda sessions on pain of dismissal.
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/a-collective-bargain-a48925f944fe"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/a-collective-bargain-a48925f944fe&lt;/a&gt;
But despite all this, labor organizers win union elections &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; strike votes, and they do so with &lt;em&gt;stupendous&lt;/em&gt; majorities - 95% or higher. This is how the most important labor victories of our day were won: the 2019 LA teachers' strike won &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Not just higher wages, but counselors in schools, mandatory greenspace for every school in LA, an end to ICE shakedowns of immigrant parents at the school-gate, and immigration law help for students and their families. What's more, the teachers used their unity, their connection to the community, and their numbers to get out the vote in the next election, winning the marginal seats that delivered 2020's Democratic Congressional majority.
As I wrote in my review of MacAlevey's book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  For McAlevey, saving America is just a scaled up version of the union organizer’s day-job. First, we fix the corrupt union, firing its sellout leaders and replacing them with fighters. Then, we organize supermajorities, person-to-person, in a methodical, organized fashion. Then we win votes, using those supermajorities to overpower the dirty tricks that rig the elections against us. Then we stay activated, because winning the vote is just the start of the fight.
  It’s a far cry from the Democratic Party consultant’s “data-driven” microtargeting strategy based on eking out tiny, fragile majorities with Facebook ads. That’s a strategy that fails in the face of even a small and disorganized voter-suppression campaign — it it’s doomed in today’s all-out assault on fair elections.
  What’s more, the consultants’ microtargeting strategy treats people as if the only thing they have to contribute is casting a ballot every couple years. A sleeping electorate will never win the fights that matter — the fight to save our planet, and to abolish billionaires.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If only the Democratic Party was as scared of its base as the Republicans are of their own.

Amazon is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; proud of its "flywheel": at first, the company offered subsidies to customers, which lured in sellers. Then, it demanded that those sellers lower their prices, which lured in more customers. With more customers, more sellers piled in. Faster and faster, the flywheel spins, creating the "everything store":
&lt;a href="https://fourweekmba.com/amazon-flywheel/"&gt;https://fourweekmba.com/amazon-flywheel/&lt;/a&gt;
The flywheel is everywhere - they even teach it in business-schools. But Amazon is not a reliable narrator. It doesn't tell the truth about the flywheel. To understand what's really going on with the flywheel, you have apply enshittification to it.
First, Amazon is good to its end users. Then it claws back the benefit to those users and delivers them to sellers. Then it claws back from sellers and takes everything for its shareholders. Then, it turns to shit. Enshittification.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys&lt;/a&gt;
Amazon - like other platform businesses - externalizes its costs onto its suppliers, then harvests the majority of the reward. Uber drivers take the risks - car and fuel payments, unpaid time waiting for a ride - and then it creams off most of the money that riders pay to get from A to B:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men&lt;/a&gt;
You can think of this as the eucalyptus tree strategy: eucalypts drop oily leaves around their base. The leaves pile up, trapping heat among all that oil until, eventually, they burst into flame, burning down all the vegetation for miles around. The only things that survive the conflagration are the eucalypt seed-pods, which need fire to open and begin germinating. Meanwhile, all the potential competitors for water, sunshine and soil nutrients have been incinerated, forming a rich, ashy mulch for the eucalypts to grow in.
(Like many Australian plants, insects and animals, eucalypts are horrifyingly bad ass.)
Uber is a pure enshittification play. For more than a decade, the company lost more than 40 cents on every dollar, using predatory pricing to destroy the yellow cab business and public transit. Now it employs ex-cab drivers at half their old wages to drive passengers at twice the old fares. It incinerated the forest and took root in the ashes.
Amazon's version of this arson relies on the same scorched-earth lock-in that Uber and other enshittifying eucalypts deploy. Amazon used investor subsidies to switch customers onto its platform, then locked them in by subsidizing the pre-purchase of a year's worth of shipping (AKA Prime). Once you've pre-paid for a year's worth of shipping, you don't shop anywhere else.
Prepayment is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; part of Amazon's lock-in: that's the real strategy behind its subscriptions services for ebooks and audiobooks. If you've already paid for a book this month - a payment you owe whether or not you actually choose a book - then any time you come across an interesting book, you get it on Kindle or Audible, because you've &lt;em&gt;already paid for it&lt;/em&gt;.
With digital items, Amazon has a &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; lock-in, thanks to Digital Rights Management (DRM). Under Section 1201 of 1998's Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), it's a felony to provide someone with a tool to remove DRM, &lt;em&gt;even if no one ever uses that tool to infringe copyright&lt;/em&gt;. That means that if Amazon sells you one of my books wrapped in its DRM, you can't play it unless you use an Amazon-authorized player. It also means that if I - the copyright proprietor! - give you a tool to remove the DRM and move your book to a rival platform, I &lt;em&gt;commit a felony&lt;/em&gt; that is punishable by five years in prison. Small wonder that Amazon insists that every audiobook on Audible - its monopoly audiobook platform - be wrapped in DRM.
So first, Amazon locks in its users, with presales, subsidies, and DRM. This lures in sellers, to be sure. As brick-and-mortar retail fails, sellers pile into Amazon's Marketplace. All the trickery with the users is the stick: "keep trying to sell off-Amazon and you'll go bust." The carrot is the Marketplace: "Sell through the Marketplace and you'll reach those customers, and we'll subsidize shipping, we'll subsidize returns, and we'll add your products to a thoroughly indexed, highly searchable catalog so that every person looking for a specific part or product will go straight to your sell-page."
Sellers can't easily use Amazon as one distribution conduit among many. This week on the Tech Won't Save Us podcast, Moira Weigel discusses her research on the way that firms have to retool to optimize for Amazon, in an episode aptly entitled "How Amazon Reshapes Small Business to Serve Itself":
&lt;a href="https://techwontsave.us/episode/162_how_amazon_reshapes_small_business_to_serve_itself_w_moira_weigel"&gt;https://techwontsave.us/episode/162_how_amazon_reshapes_small_business_to_serve_itself_w_moira_weigel&lt;/a&gt;
The episode elucidates her study of Amazon sellers for Data and Society, "Amazon’s Trickle-Down Monopoly: Third Party Sellers and the Transformation of Small Businesses":
&lt;a href="https://datasociety.net/library/amazons-trickle-down-monopoly/"&gt;https://datasociety.net/library/amazons-trickle-down-monopoly/&lt;/a&gt;
As the sale of all kinds of merchandise is retooled for Amazon delivery, every other retailer finds it harder to stay in business. The choice of goods available in physical stores dwindles, so more shoppers pile into Amazon. As Amazon's pool of shoppers grows, more merchants are driven to Amazon. This is Amazon's flywheel - not so much a virtuous cycle as a &lt;em&gt;vicious&lt;/em&gt; one.
Having locked in buyers and sellers, Amazon is now in the "burn down the forest" phase of Eucalyptus Capitalism. The company now extracts &lt;em&gt;the majority&lt;/em&gt; of its third-party sellers' income in junk fees - fulfillment, service charges, payment fees, and more. One especially juicy source of revenue is Amazon's "advertising" business:
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-13/amazon-amzn-takes-half-of-each-sale-from-2-million-small-businesses"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-13/amazon-amzn-takes-half-of-each-sale-from-2-million-small-businesses&lt;/a&gt;
Whenever discussions of adtech monopolization comes up, someone will inevitably point out that the market isn't as stagnant as it seems - after all, Amazon was able to enter the market despite the dominance of the Googbook duopoly, and build a $31b/year advertising product. But Amazon's advertising isn't like Google or Meta's advertising (not that those are good - just different).
Googbook serves as a broker between advertisers and publishers, targeting ads based on the surveillance data they amass or purchase on billions of internet users. Amazon does a little of that, but it's main "advertising" business isn't advertising at all - it's payola. Where Amazon once guaranteed sellers that if they sold the best match for a customer's search, they would top the search results, Amazon now makes its sellers bid against each other to be at the top of your results, whether or not they're the best match for your search.
That's why the first five screens of results to a search for "cat beds" are 50% ads (the first screen is 100% ads). Much of what remains is Amazon's clones of its sellers' products (Amazon uses its surveillance of its sellers shipments to fully book out the factories that make their goods, so the next time the seller goes back to re-order another batch, the factory is unable to fill the order for years; Amazon sellers call this "dragonboating"):
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/28/enshittification/#relentless-payola"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/28/enshittification/#relentless-payola&lt;/a&gt;
In other words, Amazon isn't making $31b/year selling ads - it's extracting $31b/year from its merchants to make its shoppers' experience worse. The results at the top of your search aren't the best products - they're often the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; products, because sellers who waste money making &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; products don't have anything left over to pay danegeld to Amazon:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/08/late-stage-sea-monkeys/#jeremys-razors"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/08/late-stage-sea-monkeys/#jeremys-razors&lt;/a&gt;
But maybe this doesn't matter to you. Maybe you're "good at Amazon" and can skip over the paid product placement (here's a tip, search for Amazon products on &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt;, which will often take you to a better match than Amazon's own search, skipping over the pay-to-play). Does any of this matter to you? You're still getting low prices and easy shipping, right?
Remember: enshittification is an equal-opportunity pathology. It's not just about squeezing &lt;em&gt;sellers&lt;/em&gt; - it's about squeezing &lt;em&gt;buyers&lt;/em&gt;, as anyone who's paid $55 for an Uber ride that used to cost $18 on Uber or $22 in a Yellow Cab knows.
There's just not a lot of vendors who have 51% margins on their goods. If merchants &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; sell on Amazon, and if selling on Amazon means you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; give up 51% of your take, then you're going to go out of business. Unless...you raise prices.
But wait! Amazon prices aren't higher than they are anywhere else! You can check it yourself - Amazon prices are the same as the price at Walmart and Target, they're the same as the price at your local mom-and-pop shop, and they're the same as the price if you buy direct from the manufacture. Amazon sellers aren't raising prices to cover Amazon's junk fees, are they?
Oh hell yes they are.
Amazon binds its sellers over to something called Most Favored Nation status. That means that sellers can't offer their goods more cheaply than they do on Amazon - even if it costs them (lots) less to sell in Target or direct from their websites. This means that every time a seller adds a dollar to their Amazon sale price, they have to add a dollar to the price of their goods &lt;em&gt;everywhere else&lt;/em&gt;, too.
If this sounds illegal, it's because it is. A per se violation of antitrust law, even the weak and watery version instituted during the Reagan revolution, where "consumer welfare" (AKA "low prices") is the only thing antitrust seeks to preserve.
After a bunch of state AGs filed lawsuits against Amazon over this, the company promised to cut it out.
They lied.
A new filing in California's suit against Amazon reveals that sellers live "in constant fear" of retaliation from Amazon if they allow their goods to be sold more cheaply elsewhere:
&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-vow-stop-squeezing-sellers-231635204.html"&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-vow-stop-squeezing-sellers-231635204.html&lt;/a&gt;
Indeed, the company &lt;em&gt;expanded&lt;/em&gt; the penalties it slapped on sellers, though their execs fretted that this "may generate pushback given recent positive press about our change to remove the previous price parity clause." The exec added that when these penalties came to light, it might cause people to assume that the promise to end Most Favored Nation "was not only trivial but a trick and an attempt to garner goodwill with policy makers amid increasing competition concerns."
Ya think?
The new documents reveal Amazon execs committing the cardinal sin of monopoly: documenting their nefarious plans in memos - memos in which they talk like mafia bosses: "You might want to ask [a seller] to check if his sales on other sites directly or through distributors is putting him and us at a relative competitive disadvantage. He might get the hint :)"
Amazon's chief economist told his colleagues that the ad business would "reduce selection, are not relevant to the customer’s search, and/or lead to increases in prices."
In her excellent interview with Tech Won't Save Us's Paris Marx, Weigel was critical of the way that the antitrust movement thinks about Amazon, accusing modern trustbusters of being concerned with competition for its own sake. There are undoubtably some "neo-Brandeisian" antitrust activists who feel that way, but it's a mistake to paint the whole movement with that brush.
For many trustbusters, the point of antitrust isn't increasing competition - it's &lt;em&gt;reducing corporate power&lt;/em&gt;. Amazon has built the "planned economy" that capitalists claim to deplore, but this planned economy isn't run by democratically accountable government technocrats - it's run by Party Secretary Bezos and his Commissars, who decide which goods can be profitably made and sold.
Companies are disciplined by two forces: competition and regulation. But a company that doesn't face competition swiftly becomes ungovernable, because its centrality makes it too big to fail, while its monopoly profits make it too big to jail. Amazon's ability to corrupt the political process and win deep subsidies from towns and states is purchased with monopoly money. Amazon's ability to spend millions on union busters and millions more on labor lawyers to sabotage union votes in court are bought with the same cash.
Competition is a means of cutting Amazon down to size, so that it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be regulated. Sure, we can try to do direct regulation, like breaking up Amazon. That plan has a lot going for it - but it won't be fast. It took &lt;em&gt;69 years&lt;/em&gt; to break up AT&amp;amp;T. IBM outspent the entire DoJ Antitrust Divisison, every single year, for &lt;em&gt;twelve consecutive years&lt;/em&gt;, in a war of attrition they call "Antitrust's Vietnam." In the end, IBM wriggled off the hook:
&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/jam-to-day-46b74d5b1da4"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/jam-to-day-46b74d5b1da4&lt;/a&gt;
We should do &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; to blunt the power of monopolists, including Amazon: breakups, competition rules, unionization, organized boycotts, lawsuits...everything. They have the money, but we have the people, because now that Amazon has entered end-stage enshittification, it's running out of friends. When the platform withdraws its favor from buyers, sellers and workers, who's left to stick up for it? Separately, no group of Amazon stakeholders can hold it to account, but when we all join together, we can smash the company's power - forever.

&lt;h1&gt;Restaurants won't let gig drivers pee (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/14/everybody-poops/#gotta-go"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The "gig economy" companies are classic rentiers: in the guise of operating a "two-sided market" (restaurants on one side, delivery people on the other, say), they're actually just siphoning off everyone else's margin, slowly draining them dry.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/18/politics-of-discouragement/#rent-seekers"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/18/politics-of-discouragement/#rent-seekers&lt;/a&gt;
But there's one thing the gig economy can't drain, and that's drivers' bladders.
Restaurateurs, legitimately angry at the third-party delivery apps that are destroying them through dirty tricks and rent-seeking, are denying drivers bathroom access.
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7ggz4/gig-workers-say-most-restaurants-have-banned-them-from-using-their-bathrooms"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7ggz4/gig-workers-say-most-restaurants-have-banned-them-from-using-their-bathrooms&lt;/a&gt;
It's a classic bit of misdirection, a game of "let's you and he fight." The delivery companies maintain the pretense that they're not employers and thus not required to provide bathrooms for their employees.
The restaurateurs can't strike back at distant corporate execs, nor can they do anything to the apps themselves, so they grab hold of the only tangible element of the system that's destroying them - the drivers, who are also being destroyed by the same system.
Execs have long made up unreasonable policies and then turned frontline staff out to absorb the anger and frustration of customers, while remaining insulated from any of that anger. Now it's happening to employees who deal with suppliers, too.
Meanwhile, everybody poops. And pees. Drivers can't make ends meet unless they pull 12-hour shifts. As the City of San Francisco has stubbornly refused to realize for 30 years, the fact that you don't have anywhere for people to poop doesn't mean they stop pooping.
Which is why the drivers are crouching in alleys, pissing in cups in their cars, etc.
And then handling your dinner.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/42658426_2228448403849085_1398400008222408704_n.jpg"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Facebook's "backfire effect" junk science (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/14/everybody-poops/#backfire-effect"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
There are good reasons to worry about Facebook's "fact checking" efforts, primarily that the company is a raging garbage fire that destroys everything it touches and only has two approaches to solving any problem:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it fully automated in a way that guarantees that there will be innumerable false positives in which legitimate material is erroneously censored, with no effective means of appeal, even as dedicated trolls exploit the system's blind spot to carry on as normal;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hire boiler-rooms full of low-waged workers to review horrific materials and make judgment calls that require context they don't have and can't get, until they're so traumatized they literally develop PTSD and sue the company for psychiatric care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21255870/facebook-content-moderator-settlement-scola-ptsd-mental-health"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21255870/facebook-content-moderator-settlement-scola-ptsd-mental-health&lt;/a&gt;
But there's one reason NOT to worry about Facebook factchecking, and that's the "Backfire Effect," a discredited psychological principle that holds that when learn facts that challenge their worldview, they double down on their false beliefs.
The original experiments that established the Backfire Effect as a bedrock of social psychology have spectacularly, repeatedly failed to replicate:
&lt;a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/taking-fact-checks-literally-but-not-seriously-the-effects-of-jo/16409994"&gt;https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/taking-fact-checks-literally-but-not-seriously-the-effects-of-jo/16409994&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-018-9443-y"&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-018-9443-y&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/sex-trafficking-russian-infiltration-birth-certificates-and-pedophilia-a-survey-experiment-correcting-fake-news/CFEB9AFD5F0AEB64DF32D5A7641805B6"&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/sex-trafficking-russian-infiltration-birth-certificates-and-pedophilia-a-survey-experiment-correcting-fake-news/CFEB9AFD5F0AEB64DF32D5A7641805B6&lt;/a&gt;
Nevertheless, a Facebook exec told Stat that the reason the company is holding back on thorough factchecks of covid conspiracy theories is they're worried about the Backfire Effect.
&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/01/facebooks-covid-19-misinformation-campaign-is-based-on-research-the-authors-worry-facebook-missed-the-message/"&gt;https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/01/facebooks-covid-19-misinformation-campaign-is-based-on-research-the-authors-worry-facebook-missed-the-message/&lt;/a&gt;
Again, I don't trust Facebook to do anything well, let alone factchecking. But among the things Facebook does badly, apparently, is "understanding how factchecking works."
This is well-put in an op ed by Ethan Porter and ThomasWood, authors of "False Alarm: The Truth about Political Mistruths in the Trump Era," a peer-reviewed book from Cambridge University Press.
&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/american-government-politics-and-policy/false-alarm-truth-about-political-mistruths-trump-era"&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/american-government-politics-and-policy/false-alarm-truth-about-political-mistruths-trump-era&lt;/a&gt;
"By our count, across experiments involving more than 10,000 Americans, fact-checks increase the proportion of correct responses in follow-up testing by more than 28 percentage points."
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-is-facebook-so-afraid-of-checking-facts/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/why-is-facebook-so-afraid-of-checking-facts/&lt;/a&gt;
And they did a new study to show that this would work on FB, too: "Across all issues, people who had seen misinformation and then a related fact-check were substantially more factually accurate than people who had only seen the misinformation."
"Prior research has found that, on social media, fake news is disproportionately shared by older, more conservative Americans. In our study this group did not show any special vulnerability to backfire effects. When presented with fact-checks they became more accurate too."

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/E5B4FFEB-9F9D-448B-BCCC-D1ECCED87EAA.jpg.png"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Learn magic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/14/everybody-poops/#magical-time"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I'm a longstanding fan of The Jerx, a contrarian, anonymous "social magic" blog that proposes a way of performing conjuring and mentalist effects for your friends or single individuals that cuts through much of the pretense in typical magic acts.
Andy, The Jerx's creator, is pretty relentless (and often very funny) in his dunks on other magicians, and especially on businesses that purport to teach you magic, or that sell you gimmicks to perform with.
&lt;a href="http://www.thejerx.com/blog/2020/5/13/introducing-friends-astronauts"&gt;http://www.thejerx.com/blog/2020/5/13/introducing-friends-astronauts&lt;/a&gt;
So I was excited to see a rare &lt;em&gt;endorsement&lt;/em&gt; of an online (free!) magic class, Eric Hu's Friends and Astronauts, whose mission is to "teach magic tricks for free (previously unpublished) in support of each other, the magic community, and covid relief."
&lt;a href="https://www.friendsandastronauts.com/"&gt;https://www.friendsandastronauts.com/&lt;/a&gt;
The tricks will come in time-limited collections from different performers and creators. Once one is done, it'll be removed, so you have to follow along if you want to learn all the effects.
The focus is "stuff you can tinker with while we’re quarantined. Sleights, moves, DIY gimmicks, camera tricks, self-working tricks."
Here's collection #1: "3Fast, 1 Furious," with work from Tatanka Tan, Ryan Plunkett, Joel Greenwich, and more.

&lt;h1&gt;Pythonesque small claims (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/14/everybody-poops/#dead-parrot-eh"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In Davy v. Kidwai, a small claim made at British Columbia’s Civil Resolution Tribunal, a fellow who bought a parrot diagnosed with a deadly illness argued that the merchant who sold it to him owed him a refund.
This may strike you as a familiar tale.
&lt;a href="https://loweringthebar.net/2020/05/ex-parrot-implied-warranty.html"&gt;https://loweringthebar.net/2020/05/ex-parrot-implied-warranty.html&lt;/a&gt;
The parrot Tiberius sickened with Psittacine Beak &amp;amp; Feather Disease less than a year after Kidwai sold him to Davy.
The court found that Davy had not committed fraud when he averred that the parrot was healthy (Tiberius tested positive for PBFD three weeks after the sale).
But the court did find in Davy's favor on the question of whether Tiberius's quick demise violated the implied warranty of merchantability - the idea that a product is "fit for ordinary use" at time of sale and "durable for a reasonable period of time."
The parties agreed that a healthy Eclectus parrot should live 30-40 years, and the court held that Tiberius's illness meant he was likely to live for less than one more year. Relying on an earlier case about a "defective puppy," the court awarded Davy $2500.

&lt;a name="deficit-myth"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/deficitmyth_cover2.png"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Modern monetary theory's moment has arrived (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/14/everybody-poops/#deficit-myth"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Modern monetary theory is an economic lens for understanding how money works. It starts from the commonsense assertion that national governments are money-issuers, and the rest of us are money users, and that money works differently when you are in charge of creating it.
But this challenges accepted wisdom, like the idea that national deficits cause inflation and saddle our descendants with debt. If governments are the source of money, then they don't tax us in order to spend. They spend (which puts money into the economy) and then tax back.
If the government runs a "balanced budget" that means it's taxing as much money of out existence as it is spending into existence, leaving behind no money for the rest of us to save or spend. Balanced budgets starve the private sector of the money it needs to operate.
When that happens, banks create private money (lending money that they don't have on deposit, something that they are allowed to do as part of their deal with the national government), and then they get to charge interest for those loans.
So the finance sector hates public money - which benefits everyone - and loves private money - which benefits them. But of course, banks inevitably overspend and since they aren't national governments, they risk defaulting, so they need public money to bail them out.
Governments can't default on debts owed in currencies they issue. They just type more zeroes into a spreadsheet at the national bank and they can pay off any debt they want. They are not "monetarily constrained."
The constraint on governments is &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt;, not money. If the government tries to buy things the private sector is using, it gets into a bidding war and prices go up. That's inflation.
Likewise, if the private sector has too much money, it bids against itself and again, prices go up - inflation (think of the 2008 crisis, when banks created too much money and we got a speculative housing bubble, leaving governments to create money to bail them out).
Governments don't tax to balance budgets: they tax to remove money from the system to fight inflation. Progressive taxation - higher taxes on the rich - minimize the privation of having some of your money annihilated, and it also weakens the 1%'s power to influence politics.
(Governments have done other things to fight inflation when they felt the need to buy things the private sector wanted, like during WWII: war bonds that locked up the money pumped into economy with war spending, and rationing, which limited bids on war materiel).
MMT has seen many vindications since the 2008 crisis, when the bailouts didn't produce the inflation we'd been warned of. Then, when the GOP tax plan passed and left the fed budget trillions in deficit, we were warned that the USG had no more resources to fight a future crisis.
But when the crisis hit, Congress was able to spend trillions into existence with the stroke of a pen, without inflation, because the private sector no longer wanted the labor of a large fraction of the workforce. The existence of the tax deficit was irrelevant.
The reason to be alarmed by the deficit left behind by the tax bill is that it will make rich people richer, not that it will deprive the federal government of money. That's like saying giving free Itunes gift cards to plutes starves Apple of cards for the rest of us.
All of this is beautifully explained in a new NPR Marketplace interview with Stephanie Kelton, MMT's most articulate, thoughtful and knowledgable spokesperson.
&lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart-with-kai-and-molly/maybe-modern-monetary-theory-is-an-answer-to-the-covid-19-economic-crisis/"&gt;https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart-with-kai-and-molly/maybe-modern-monetary-theory-is-an-answer-to-the-covid-19-economic-crisis/&lt;/a&gt;
Kelton's interview is tied to her upcoming (June) release, "The Deficit Myth." The book couldn't be more timely. With the private sector no longer interested in the labor of so many of us, nor the goods we can produce, MMT is the lens we need.

&lt;h1&gt;Pandemics shatter AI's intrinsic conservativism (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/14/everybody-poops/#homeostatic-mechanism"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
One of my favorite insights on Machine Learning comes form Molly Sauter's 2017 essay Instant Recall, which describes ML's intrinsic conservativism. Having been trained on historical data, ML can only make good predictions if the future's like the past.
&lt;a href="https://reallifemag.com/instant-recall/"&gt;https://reallifemag.com/instant-recall/&lt;/a&gt;
That's why your phone's predictive text nudges you to follow up "My" with "darling" if you habitually text your spouse with that salutation. When you type a word it's never seen, it autocompletes with a statistically normal following word.
I took a stab at talking about some of the implications of this in an LA Review of Books essay last January:
&lt;a href="http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/provocations/neophobic-conservative-ai-overlords-want-everything-stay/"&gt;http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/provocations/neophobic-conservative-ai-overlords-want-everything-stay/&lt;/a&gt;
One interesting side-effect of the pandemic is that it magnifies this conservative bias in ML: because we're acting in unprecedented ways, the ML-based  predictive systems are misfiring badly ("automation is in a tailspin").
&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/"&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/&lt;/a&gt;
Supply-chain forecasting tools are ordering both too much of things, and too little. Recommendation systems haven't figured out that "in stock" is the most important criteria to sort by. Shoppers aren't interested in big ticket items.
Some of these behaviors are so unusual that they're tripping fraud-detection systems that apply the brakes to an already broken system ("You never bought gardening or bread-making stuff before, why are you ordering so much now?").
And when big players like Amazon alter their algorithms to correct for this, it adds even more chaos to the downstream systems that are trying to predict what Amazon will do.
People who claim to know the future are always either con-artists or delusional. The addition of abstruse stats to the prediction provides the discredited profession of fortune-telling with a veneer of empirical facewash, but it doesn't bring us closer to precognition.
So much of what we call "accurate prediction" is just "forcing/nudging people to act the way they used to" - I can predict with 100% accuracy that you will hold the same posture for the next five minutes, if I'm allowed to shoot you through the heart before the clock starts.
As our conservative AI overlords encounter the reality of an unprecedented situation, the difference between coercion and prediction is becoming a lot clearer.

&lt;h1&gt;China’s war on big data backstabbing (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/07/backstabbed/#big-data-backstabbing"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
China has a different relationship with its tech monopolies than the US does, thanks to a combination of state ownership, state investment, crossovers between Party members and PLA veterans with the directorships and leadership of Chinese Big Tech.
Both countries use their Big Tech firms to project soft power (and surveillance capabilities) around the world, of course, and the US tech industry is certainly part of the US military-industrial complex, but that relationship is more tacit than explicit.
But overt or tacit, explicit or unspoken, monopolistic power harms the public and - eventually - challenges the power of the state, which creates coalitions between the public and their governments to fight back against corporate concentration and dominance.
In November, the Chinese State Administration for Market Supervision published a draft "New Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Platform Economy," proposing ambitious curbs on Chinese tech monopoly power.
&lt;a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/hd/zjdc/202011/t20201109_323234.html"&gt;http://www.samr.gov.cn/hd/zjdc/202011/t20201109_323234.html&lt;/a&gt;
The centerpiece of these regulations are prohibitions on "Big Data Backstabbing" - using digital surveillance to dynamically price goods according to a merchant's guess at how much you're willing to pay.
&lt;a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006494/can-a-new-regulation-fix-chinas-big-data-backstabbing-problem%3F"&gt;https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006494/can-a-new-regulation-fix-chinas-big-data-backstabbing-problem%3F&lt;/a&gt;
While it's hard to know if you're being backstabbed, it's an article of faith among Chinese internet users that this is going on: 88% believe it occurs, and 57% believe they've been a victim of it.
Backstabbing is thought of as a kind of anti-loyalty reward whereby existing customers are charged higher prices; the popular memes for this are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Old users are treated worse than dogs”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the people who know you best who hurt you the most"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/351082788"&gt;https://www.zhihu.com/question/351082788&lt;/a&gt;
Price discrimination is one of those subjects that reveal the cracks in economics: economists (especially the ruling neoclassical cult) consider price discrimination "optimal" and argue that economies with widespread price discrimination are better at allocating resources.
But people &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; price-discrimination. Think of the universal loathing we have for the ever-shifting, opaque system by which the airlines price seats (AA is so desperate that they're offering a "always lowest price" package to fliers who prepay for $5k/year of travel).
Price discrimination is so widely and automatically viewed as unfair - despite economists' claims of "optimalness" - that companies have to hide their price discrimination and lie about it or use euphemisms for it, which just makes the whole thing seem even shadier.
It's a perfect wedge issue to rally popular support for the wonky world of anti-monopoly enforcement, so that states that defend their power from corporations can secure a massive cohort of pissed-off shoppers to back their play.
Article 17 of the new proposed Chinese rules sets out the factors that can lead to a finding of "discriminatory treatment" in a transaction, giving regulators leeway to punish data-mining to determine a buyer's purchasing power or history, online activity, or preferences.
Interestingly, it's not a firm requirement: the rule &lt;em&gt;allows&lt;/em&gt; regulators to consider data-mining-based discrimination, but does not require them to when investigating accusations of ripoffs.
The rule also carves out some broadly defined "safe harbors" for platforms, like offering promotions to attract new customers, and, according to Sixth Tone's analysis by Shen Weiwei, allows companies to use credit histories to practice price discrimination - a huge loophole.
Shen suggests that the vagueness of the rules are a feature, not a bug, allowing regulators to practice forbearance when it comes to conduct they don't consider odious, and cracking down selectively on those they judge to be the worst offenders.

&lt;h1&gt;Spike Lee made a David Byrne concert movie (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/16/spike-lee-joint/#american-utopia"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Without question, the greatest concert movie of all time is STOP MAKING SENSE, Jonathan Demme's 1984 film based on Talking Heads's four-night engagement at LA's Pantages theater while touring Speaking in Tongues.
Not coincidentally, the greatest rock show I saw in the 2010s was David Byrne's AMERICAN UTOPIA (I even got to see David backstage!). It built on the incredible choreography of the LOVE THIS GIANT tour (where they got the brass to do marching band choreography).
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/44134489221_171445d74c_c.jpg"/&gt;
On top of that, his designers built a fantastic, eerie, easy-to-strike set reminiscent in some ways of the STOP MAKING SENSE tour - watching the hands strike that set after the show in San Jose was incredible - 15 minutes!
Now here's the incredible news: &lt;em&gt;Spike Lee made a movie out of American Utopia&lt;/em&gt;'s Broadway run, debuting on HBO Max on Oct 17:

&lt;h1&gt;Board unilaterally sells Mountain Equipment "Co-op" to US private equity (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/16/spike-lee-joint/#casse-le-mec"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
It's hard to find Canadians who dislike Mountain Equipment Co-Op, the venerable, beloved co-operative outdoor store modeled on REI. Millions of us have paid $5 to join the co-op and make it our first port of all for outdoor gear.
It's being sold to a rapacious American Private Equity fund.
No. Really.
It's a sordid and disgusting tale.
About a decade ago, the board started to favour members who had operational experience over traditional board members - drawn from the co-ops rank and file.
&lt;a href="https://www.citynews1130.com/2020/05/20/mec-allegations-election-rigging/"&gt;https://www.citynews1130.com/2020/05/20/mec-allegations-election-rigging/&lt;/a&gt;
They rammed through by-law changes in '13 that let them:
a) Disqualify potential board candidates from nomination; and
b) Recommend slates of candidates to the membership
This kicked off a spiral of ever-more-rigged elections that changed the co-op's fundamental character.
Board seats started going to people whose experience was in the C-suites of major for-profit corporations; while the executive ranks were filled with merchandisers from failed electronics stores who filled the co-op stores with stupid gadgets.
The co-op underwent disastrous expansion under this new regime, and began to lose money - $23.5m in losses on $462m in sales in 2018/19.
The board ignored members and founders who called on it to return to selling good outdoor gear at good prices:
&lt;a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/founders-reflect-on-sale-of-mountain-equipment-co-op"&gt;https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/founders-reflect-on-sale-of-mountain-equipment-co-op&lt;/a&gt;
And then, in a stroke of absolute malfeasance, they voted to sell the co-op to a US private equity firm called Kingswood Capital Management.
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/canada-mountain-equipment-biggest-co-op-sale"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/canada-mountain-equipment-biggest-co-op-sale&lt;/a&gt;
As a reminder, here's the private equity playbook: buy beloved companies, load them with debt, reduce the quality of their products, liquide their pension funds, collect gigantic "management fees" and walk away, leaving behind wreckage and sorrow.
MEC's board undertook this decision without putting it to the co-op membership - you know, the actual owners of MEC - who could have rescued the co-op with a modest $5-10 fee per member.
It's not clear what will become of the proceeds of the sale (the co-op owns $372m in assets) - I wouldn't be surprised if the board and C-suite of the co-op found a way to take the lion's share in "consulting fees" and similar grifts.
I have served as a board member on a Canadian co-op. This is absolutely illegitimate, reckless conduct and I hope the board is sued over it. I think they acted illegally.
Co-op members have started a petition - which has attracted 30,000 signatures in mere days. I signed it.

&lt;h1&gt;Turning plastics into carbon nanotubes (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/19/nanotubes-r-us/#one-word"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Between research about microplastics in the environment, China ceasing plastic recycling, and revelations about Big Oil's decades of disinformation about the recyclability of plastic overall, I've been feeling a sense of impending, plasticky doom.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/14/they-knew/#doing-it-again"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/14/they-knew/#doing-it-again&lt;/a&gt;
But every now and again, I'll get a little cause for hope, some news story about an enzyme or catalytic process that can turn waste plastic into something useful without creating untold environmental wreckage.
Scientific papers like "Microwave-initiated catalytic deconstruction of plastic waste into hydrogen and high-value carbons" in @nature are incredibly promising!
&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-020-00518-5"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-020-00518-5&lt;/a&gt;
I parsed it with the help of John Timmer's layperson-friendly breakdown for Ars Technica.
The researchers mixed grocery-store waste-plastic with iron, then hit it with microwaves.
&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/if-recycling-plastics-isnt-making-sense-remake-the-plastics/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/if-recycling-plastics-isnt-making-sense-remake-the-plastics/&lt;/a&gt;
The resulting reaction liberated vast amounts of hydrogen from the plastic, leaving behind carbon nanotubes. The majority of the iron was left unchanged, and they were able to mix fresh plastic in with it ten more times, leaving behind a 92% nanotube output.
Timmer points to a US synthetic biology group that has an idea for processing the hydrogen released in the process: an enzyme that, when mixed with porous silicon oxide, turns out lubricant, fuel, or other hydrocarbons based on tweaks to the process.
If you lack access to the paywalled version of the article and want to read it yourself, here's a Sci-Hub mirror:
&lt;a href="https://sci-hub.st/downloads/2020-10-13/e2/10.1038@s41929-020-00518-5.pdf#view=FitH"&gt;https://sci-hub.st/downloads/2020-10-13/e2/10.1038@s41929-020-00518-5.pdf#view=FitH&lt;/a&gt;
(The research was done at public universities, but a condition of publishing in Nature is signing over the rights, denying public access. Researchers are not paid by Nature for these rights, and their own institutions then have to pay to access their work)

&lt;h1&gt;Kids reason, adults rationalize (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/19/nanotubes-r-us/#kids-r-alright"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
This is the second and final week of "The Attack Surface lectures," a series of 8 bookstore hosted virtual events exploring themes in the third Little Brother book, Attack Surface.
&lt;a href="https://read.macmillan.com/torforge/cory-doctorow-virtual-lecture-series/"&gt;https://read.macmillan.com/torforge/cory-doctorow-virtual-lecture-series/&lt;/a&gt;
On Weds, Oct 21, the theme is "Little Revolutions," AKA writing radical fiction for kids, with guests Tochi Onyebuchi and Bethany C Morrow; you see, Little Brother and its sequel, Homeland, were young adult novels, while Attack Surface is a novel for adults.
That fact, and the upcoming event, have me thinking about the difference between fiction for teens and for adults. Litquake were kind enough to publish my working-through of this thinking in  a new essay called "Kids Use Reason, Adults Rationalize."
&lt;a href="https://lithub.com/cory-doctorow-kids-use-reason-adults-rationalize/"&gt;https://lithub.com/cory-doctorow-kids-use-reason-adults-rationalize/&lt;/a&gt;
I can pinpoint the exact moment I decided to write for teens: it was when Kathe Koja - herself an accomplished writer in multiple genres - guest-lectured at a Clarion writing workshop I was teaching.
Koja described how, on school visits, kids would argue passionately with her about her books, and how this wasn't rudeness - it was respect. The kids weren't reading her books as mere distractions; they were treating them as possible roadmaps to a complex and difficult world.
Before then, I was with Steven Brust: "Telling someone they wrote a bad book is like telling them they've got an ugly kid. Even if it's true, it's too late to do anything about it now, and anyway, they did everything they could to prevent it."
But Koja convinced me that when it came to teens, an exception was warranted. Little Brother and Homeland were, in effect, bets on that proposition. The bets paid off: countless now-adult readers have approached me to tell me how those books shaped their worldview.
Some became activists or cryptographers or hackers or tech workers, but even the readers who DIDN'T go into tech tell me that the books made them aware of both the liberatory power of technology, and its power to oppress, and the importance of taking a side in that fight.
Spending a decade+ in contact with young readers has changed my worldview, too. It's made me realize that while the power to reason is often present in very young people, the context - the stuff to reason &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; - takes time to accumulate.
There are some disciplines that lean heavily on reasoning and have relatively little context: math, computer science, chess. Learn some basic principles, apply your reasoning, and you can build up towering edifaces of work and expertise.
Other disciplines - law, medicine, history - simply require so much &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; as well as reason that just packing in the reading takes years and years, no matter how good you are at reasoning. That's why there are child chess prodigies but not child history prodigies.
Fiction is part of that context-acquisition process.
The realization that adults don't have a monopoly on reason has a corollary: kids don't have a monopoly on failures of reason.
Indeed, there is a distinctive form of failure-to-reason endemic to adulthood: long-term rationalization, the process by which one makes a series of small compromises, one at a time, that add up to a catastrophic moral failure.
That's the crux of ATTACK SURFACE, whose protagonist, Masha, is having a moral reckoning with a career spent in mass surveillance technology - a career she has managed to square with her  moral sensibilities through careful rationalization and compartmentalization.
My bet in this book is that adults who feel hopeless and nihilistic about the future will find a new kind of story: one in which the unitary hero whose personal actions save the world is replaced with a narrative of mass movements, political will, and collective action.
Rebuilding our digital infrastructure for human liberation  is a vast task, but it's only a step on the road to a far larger and more urgent task: rebuilding our physical world and its energy and infrastructure to survive and address the climate emergency.
"The climate emergency demands a moonshot, but the moonshot wasn’t undertaken by science heroes working in their solitary labs: Neil Armstrong walked on the moon because of the collective, state-sponsored efforts of millions of people. If we hadn’t gotten to the Moon, the fault would have been with the system, not with Armstrong’s failure to build a rocket ship."

&lt;h1&gt;Taxes are for the little people (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/15/guillotines-and-taxes/#carried-interest"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
If you wanna do crimes, make them incredibly complicated and technical. Like the hustlers that came into the bookstore I worked at and spun these long-ass stories about why they needed money for a Greyhound ticket home.
Those guys shoulda studied the private equity sector.
Private equity's playbook is to borrow giant sums by putting up other peoples' companies as collateral (yes, really). Then they use that money to buy the company they mortgaged, and pay themselves a huge dividend.
Then they sell off the company's assets and pay themselves even more money. That leaves the company in a state of precarity - assets they once owned, like their buildings, they now rent. If the rent goes up, they have to find the money to cover it.
All of this forms a pretense for mass layoffs, defaulting on pension obligations, lowering product quality, stiffing suppliers and borrowing more money. If the company doesn't go bust, the PE looters can flip it to &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; PE company, that does it again.
Whenever you see something really terrible happening to a business that once offered useful products and services and paid decent wages, it's a safe bet that PE is behind it. Toys R Us, Sears, your local hospital - and that memestock favorite, AMC.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/12/mammon-worshippers/#silver-lake-partners"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/12/mammon-worshippers/#silver-lake-partners&lt;/a&gt;
Private equity goons make their money in two ways: the first is by pocketing 20% of  these special dividends and other extractive policies that hollow out business.
This is money at PE managers get paid for spending their investors' money. It's a wage, in other words.
But thanks to the "carried interest" loophole (a hangover from 16th-century sea captains that has nothing to do with "interest" on loans), they get to treat these wages as "capital gains" and pay far less tax on them.
The fact that we give preferential tax treatment to capital gains (money derived from gambling), while taxing wages (money derived from doing useful work) at higher rates really tells you everything you need to know about our economic priorities.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/29/writers-must-be-paid/#carried-interest"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/29/writers-must-be-paid/#carried-interest&lt;/a&gt;
The carried interest loophole lets PE crooks treat their salaries as capital gains, are taxed at a much lower rate than the wages of the workers whose lives they're destroying.
On top of the 20% profit-share that PE bosses get every year, they also pocket a 2% "management fee" for all the "value" they add to the companies they've taken over.
This is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a wage. The 20% profit-share at least has an element of risk, but that 2% is guaranteed.
But PE bosses have spent more than a decade booking that 2% wage as a capital gain, using a tax-fraud tactic called "fee waivers." The details of how a fee waiver don't matter because it's all bullshit, like the tale of the needful Greyhound ticket.
All that matters is that a legal fiction allows people earning &lt;em&gt;eight- or nine-figure salaries&lt;/em&gt; to treat &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of those wages as capital gains and pay lower rates of tax on them than the janitors who clean their toilets or the workers whose jobs they will annihilate.
Now, the IRS knows all about this. Whistleblowers came forward in 2011 to warn them about it. The Treasury even struck a committee to come up with new rules to fix it.
But Obama failed to make those rules stick, and then Trump put a former tax-cheat enabler in charge of redrafting them. The cheater-friendly rules became law on Jan 5, and handed PE bosses hundreds of millions in savings every year.
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/12/business/private-equity-taxes.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/12/business/private-equity-taxes.html&lt;/a&gt;
The New York Times report on "fee waivers" goes through the rulemaking history, the technical details of the scam, and the gutting of the IRS, which can no longer afford to audit rich people and now makes its quotas by preferentially auditing low earners who can't afford lawyers.
But former securities lawyer Jerri-Lynn Scofield's breakdown of the Times piece on Naked Capitalism really connects the dots:
&lt;a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/06/private-inequity-nyt-examines-how-the-private-equity-industry-avoids-taxes.html"&gt;https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/06/private-inequity-nyt-examines-how-the-private-equity-industry-avoids-taxes.html&lt;/a&gt;
As Scofield and Yves Smith point out, if Biden wanted to do one thing for tax justice, he could abolish preferential treatment for capital gains. If we want a society of makers and doers instead of owners and gamblers, we shouldn't penalize wages and reward rents.
There's an especial urgency to this right now. As the PE bosses themselves admit, they went on a buying spree during the pandemic (they call it "saving American businesses"). Larger and larger swathes of the productive economy are going into the PE meat-grinder.
Worse still, the PE industry has revived its most destructive tactic, the "club deal," whereby PE firms collaborate to take out whole economic sectors in one go:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/14/billionaire-class-solidarity/#club-deals"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/14/billionaire-class-solidarity/#club-deals&lt;/a&gt;
We're at an historic crossroads for tax justice. On the one hand, you have the blockbuster Propublica report on leaked IRS files that revealed that the net tax rate paid by America's billionaires is close to zero.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/08/leona-helmsley-was-a-pioneer/#eat-the-rich"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/08/leona-helmsley-was-a-pioneer/#eat-the-rich&lt;/a&gt;
This has left the Bootlicker-Industrial Complex in the bizarre position of arguing that anyone who suggests someone who amasses billions of dollars should pay more than $0 in tax is a radical socialist (so far, the go-to tactic is to make performative noises about privacy).
At the same time, the G7 has agreed to an historical tax deal that will see businesses taxed at least 15% on the revenue they make in each country, irrespective of the accounting fictions they use to claim that the profits are being earned in the middle of the Irish Sea.
That deal is historical, but the fact that it's being hailed as curbing corporate power reveals just how distorted our discourse about corporate taxes has become.
As Thomas Piketty writes, self-employed people pay 20-50% tax in countries that will tax the world's wealthiest companies a mere 15%: "For SMEs as well as for the working and middle classes, it is impossible to create a subsidiary to relocate its profits to a tax haven."
Piketty, like Gabriel Zucman, says that EU nations should charge multinationals a minimum of 25%, and like Zucman, he reminds us that the G7 deal does nothing to help the poorest countries in the Global South.
&lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2021/06/15/the-g7-legalizes-the-right-to-defraud/"&gt;https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2021/06/15/the-g7-legalizes-the-right-to-defraud/&lt;/a&gt;
These countries and the EU have something in common: they aren't "monetarily sovereign" (that is, they don't issue their own currencies &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; borrow in the currencies they issue).
Sovereign currency issuers (US, UK, Japan, Canada, Australia, etc) don't need to tax in order to pay for programs - first they spend new money into the economy and then they tax it back out again.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/10/compton-cowboys/#the-deficit-myth"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/10/compton-cowboys/#the-deficit-myth&lt;/a&gt;
These countries can run out of stuff to buy in their currency, but they can't run out of the currency itself. Monetarily sovereign countries don't tax to fund their operations.
Rather, they tax to fight inflation (if you spend money into the economy every year but don't take some of it out again through taxation, more and more money will chase the same goods and services and prices will go up).
And just as importantly, monetary sovereigns tax to reduce the spending power - and hence the political power - of the wealthy. The fact that PE bosses had billions of tax-free dollars at their disposal let them spend millions to distort tax policy to legalize fee waivers.
Taxing the money - and hence the power - of wage earners at higher rates than gamblers creates politics that value gambling above work, because gamblers get to spend the winnings they retain on political influence, including campaigns to rig the casino in their favor.
This discredits the whole system, shatters social cohesion and makes it hard to even imagine that we can build a better world - or avert the climate-wracked dystopia on the horizon.
But for Eurozone countries (whose monetary supply is controlled by technocrats at the ECB) and countries of the Global South (whom the IMF has forced into massive debts owed in US dollars, which they can only get by selling their national products), tax is even more urgent.
The US could fund its infrastructure needs just by creating money at the central bank.
EU and post-colonial lands can only fund programs with taxes, so for them, billionaires don't just distort their priorities and corrupt their system - they also starve their societies.
But that doesn't mean that monetary sovereigns can tolerate billionaires and their policy distortions. The UK is monetarily sovereign, in the G7, and its finance minister is briefing to have the City of London's banks exempted from the new tax deal.
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/u-k-pushes-for-city-of-london-exemption-from-global-tax-deal"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/u-k-pushes-for-city-of-london-exemption-from-global-tax-deal&lt;/a&gt;
Now, the City of London is one of the world's great financial crime-scenes, and its banks are responsible for an appreciable portion of the planet-destabilizing frauds of the past 100 years.
During the Great Financial Crisis AIG used its London subsidiary to commit crimes its US branch couldn't get away with. The City of London was the epicenter of the LIBOR fraud, the Greensill collapse - it's the Zelig of finance crime, the heart of every fraud.
UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak claims banks are already paying high global tax and can't afford to be part of the G7 tax deal. If that was true, it wouldn't change the fact that these banks are too big to jail and anything that shrinks them is a net benefit.
But it's not true.
As the tax justice campaigner Richard Murphy points out, the risk to banks like Barclays adds up to 0.8% of global turnover: "The big deal is that the 15% global minimum tax rate is much too low. Suinak has yet again spectacularly missed the point."

&lt;h1&gt;Meet the new generation of pro-abortion activists (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#never-again"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
With Roe v Wade likely headed to the US Supreme Court and a woman's right to a safe and legal abortion under grave threat, a new generation of pro-abortion activists are rising up.
As Amelia Pollard writes for The American Prospect, this new wave is militant, organized and unapologetic - rather than engaging in petty framing wars about being "pro-choice" or "pro-life," they call themselves "pro-abortion."
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/justice/the-new-pro-abortion-generation/"&gt;https://prospect.org/justice/the-new-pro-abortion-generation/&lt;/a&gt;
They link the right to safe, legal abortion on demand to wider struggles for gender equity, trans inclusion, and, especially, comprehensive sex education and access to contraception as the single most effective way to reduce the number of abortions.
They're not intimidated by evangelical harassers who congregate outside of abortion clinics to terrorize pregnant people seeking abortions, nor are they shy about bucking movement leadership when they engage in trans-exclusionary bullying.
These young people are rising up especially in "red states" like Mississippi, where cynical politicians have courted the misogynist and religious maniac vote by attacking abortion rights, sex education, and access to contraception.
They're starting their organizing careers in high school, demanding sex education and access to contraception, and staying with the movement as they graduate. They demand that abortion be understood as an issue at the intersection of race, class and gender.
As such, they don't just focus on changing the law, they also work on the immediate needs of people seeking abortions, raising money to defray travel and other costs as abortion clinics disappear thanks to restrictive laws.
They also offer emotional support, "one-on-one care during every stage of the abortion process," and a new crop of "abortion doulas" is emerging that helps before, during and after an abortion.
I grew up in the abortion legalisation movement. My mother was an early abortion rights activist who marched for reproductive rights while she was pregnant with me.

&lt;img alt="A 1976 Toronto Star photo depicting me with Dr Henry Morgentaler. Photo by Bob Olsen." src="https://craphound.com/images/morgentaler_star.jpg"/&gt;
One of the first times I ever appeared in the paper, it was in the company of Dr Henry Morgantaler, the heroic Canadian abortion-rights campaigner who was jailed and terrorized by the state and by anti-abortion terrorists.
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/8882641733"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/8882641733&lt;/a&gt;
I spent my teen years doing clinic defense, including at the Morgentaler Clinic - a clinic that was eventually torched by religious terrorists. Morgantaler's anti-abortion opponents were absolutely shameless.
At one point, when he was seeking an injunction against people who'd repeatedly blocked access to his clinic, the anti-abortion side's lawyer accused him of aborting gentile babies to get revenge for his experiences in Auschwitz.
When he was finally recognised with the Order of Canada in 2008, he didn't mince words: "It's an appointment I deserve, even if I say so myself."
&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/morgentaler-honoured-by-order-of-canada-federal-government-not-involved-1.716775"&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/morgentaler-honoured-by-order-of-canada-federal-government-not-involved-1.716775&lt;/a&gt;
The erosion of reproductive rights in America - and the weaponising of a woman's fertility to whip low-information evangelicals into line (the same people who spent 50 years ignoring abortion as a "Catholic issue") has been an ongoing catastrophe to watch.
The rise of a decentralised, indomitable, modern, militant pro-abortion movement of young people with new tactics to suit this moment is a ray of hope.

&lt;img alt="A three-card monte fraudster; his face has been replaced by a covid molecule." src="https://craphound.com/images/covid-blowoff.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Anti-vaxers cool the mark (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#goffman"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I often write about the material conditions that make people vulnerable to conspiratorial thinking, especially covid-denial, anti-masking, and vaccine refusal.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/04/eighty-sixed/#risk-management"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/04/eighty-sixed/#risk-management&lt;/a&gt;
Specifically, I think it's important to go beyond the mystical explanations of "algorithmic radicalization" that assume that ad-tech companies are telling the truth when they claim that big data and machine learning can make people do anything.
&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59"&gt;https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59&lt;/a&gt;
The fact that regulators let the Sacklers tell obvious lies about opioid safety so that they could make $10+b pushing Oxy, igniting the opioid epidemic that has killed 800,000 Americans is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; reason not to trust "the system."
Which is not to say that platforms are irrelevant to the growth of conspiracies - but that relevance is not in the automated mind-control. Rather, it's that online platforms let people find each other.
That's what ad-tech is, a people-finding machine, e.g., "Find me people who looked at fridge reviews to show these fridge ads to."
People-finding has a profound impact on our ideology and discourse.
People with all kinds of disfavored views can locate others without risking social sanction. If you've always felt that somehow neither gender binary describes you, but lacked the words to explain it, you can use the internet to find people who have those words.
You can join them in community and find the strength and courage to come out.
Of course, this also applies to people who've always secretly dreamed of marching through the streets holding a torch and shouting "Jews will not replace us."
People-finding is also important for "ideological entrepreneurs" - people hoping to spread ideas, for good or ill. An important kind of ideological entrepreneur is the con-artist - a fraudster on the grift.
Covid fraudsters have found it easy to locate marks, thanks to the combination of a large number of people who've been traumatized by official corruption and collusion (for example, the opioid epidemic) and the people-finding character of the internet.
The most successful covid disinformation is orchestrated by convicted fraudsters with histories of conning people for money - like Joseph Mercola, a Florida osteopath the New York Times called "The Most Influential Spreader of Coronavirus Misinformation."
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/24/technology/joseph-mercola-coronavirus-misinformation-online.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/24/technology/joseph-mercola-coronavirus-misinformation-online.html&lt;/a&gt;
In 2017, the FTC made Mercola pay $3m to settle claims related to his fraudulent tanning bed business. Now he's got a vast online following whom he warns that vaccines will "alter your genetic coding." He advises people to buy his vitamins instead.
Writing for The Atlantic, Brooke Harrington frames the bizarre about-faces from covid disinformation pushers who now espouse vaccination in the context of the sociology of con-artists.
&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/vaccine-refusers-dont-want-blue-americas-respect/619627/"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/vaccine-refusers-dont-want-blue-americas-respect/619627/&lt;/a&gt;
Sociologist Erving Goffman's classic 1952 essay "On Cooling the Mark Out" describes his studies of the victims of con artists, and the way that their shame at being taken let the fraudsters revictimize them.
&lt;a href="https://infofranpro.wdfiles.com/local--files/19520101-on-cooling/19520101%20On%20cooling.pdf"&gt;https://infofranpro.wdfiles.com/local--files/19520101-on-cooling/19520101%20On%20cooling.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
Victims were so embarrassed at being marks - at being convinced of "highly dubious claims - and blocking out all information to the contrary" - that they'll do anything to recover their self-image as discerning, smart people.
That desperation opens the mark up to being "cooled" by a confederate of the con-artist - a member in good standing of the mark's "reference group" (the network of people we all rely on) - to ensure the mark blames themselves, not the con artist.
The cooler helps marks rebuild their lives and social standing, and also re-frame the story of the scam so that nothing bad really happened.
This, Harrington says, is the right way to understand the wave of far-right pundits and grifters who now say vaccines are safe and needful, after a year and a half of social and economic profiteering through disinformation.
When Ron DeSantis says "the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down," he's shifting the blame from his cohort of cynical disinfo peddlers to other marks, and opening space for a mark to go and get vaccinated at last.
This cool-off lets the con artists skip away without consequence and can lead to more vaccinations - but for so long as your reference group continues to believe in the con, it's a tough sell.
That's why Missouri's Ozarks Healthcare has created a private entrance where people in disguise can come and get a quiet vaccination - they don't want their friends and family, the people they depend on, to turn on them.
But Harrington is optimistic: "The conservative coolers are finally on the case, and only they have a chance of transforming partisan vaccine refusers into vaccine adopters."
Beyond that, Harrington urges us to adopt a sociological framework for understanding what's going on with vaccine refusal - not a matter of individuals making bad choices, but as a community-level phenomenon.

&lt;img alt="An Amazon Prime Air drone superimposed over a raging fireball." src="https://craphound.com/images/primeair-fireball.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Drone delivery crashes (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#droned"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
When Amazon announced "Prime Air," a forthcoming drone delivery service, in 2016, there was a curious willingness on the part of the press - even the tech press - to take the promise of a sky full of delivery drones at face value.
This despite the obvious problems with such a scheme: the consequences of midair collisions, short battery life, overhead congestion, regulatory hurdles and more. Also despite the fact that delivery drones, like jetpacks, are really only practical as sfx in an sf movie.
Now, Amazon has laid off more than 100 Prime Air employees. Departing workers told Wired UK that the division is "collapsing inwards," "dysfunctional," "organised chaos." They called management "detached from reality."
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air&lt;/a&gt;
As Andrew Kersley reminds us, Prime Air was the centerpiece of a massive PR push, with school tours of a "secret" facility and showy promotional videos (high-sfx sf movies, really). Execs said drones would arrive "within months."
But after the PR wins, the organization became a do-nothing boondoggle where employees openly drank beer at their desks at 10AM.
All of this raises the question: why? Why spend millions on something that was obviously not going to work out?
My theory is tech companies promise to deliver impossible things n order to cultivate an air of mystical capability that's invoked to mask real-world awfulness.
Amazon's automation claims - about drones, warehouse robots, and self-driving delivery vehicles - masks their ghastly labor abuses. This is especially useful when automation is used to make workers' lives &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;.
The more automated an Amazon warehouse is, the more workers it injures. Amazon warehouses injure more workers than any other kind of warehouse.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/17/reverse-centaur/#reverse-centaur"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/17/reverse-centaur/#reverse-centaur&lt;/a&gt;
Seen in this light, many of tech's worst promises become less silly: Uber promises self-driving cars to distract us from its exploitative labor practices. Imaginary self-driving cars are a way to make worker misclassification seem temporary.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#goober"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#goober&lt;/a&gt;
Facebook's promise of AI-based content moderation is a good way to distract us from its dysfunctional, high-handed and corrupt moderation practices, making htem seem like a minor hurdle that will soon fall.
&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201211/15111245871/content-moderation-case-study-facebooks-ai-continues-to-struggle-with-identifying-nudity-2020.shtml"&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201211/15111245871/content-moderation-case-study-facebooks-ai-continues-to-struggle-with-identifying-nudity-2020.shtml&lt;/a&gt;
Every single thing Elon Musk says goes into this category: "It's ok to destroy astronomy because my satellites obviate the need for fiber infrastructure." "Tunnels (not transit) will solve traffic jams." "I am saving the planet by keeping SUVs on the road."
It's all the kind of thing Riley Quinn calls "jingling keys" - a distraction for the technologically unsophisticated (and techies who have dipped into their own product) while everyday corporate crimes are committed under our noses.

&lt;img alt="The Facebook '1 Hacker Way' sign, before it sit the Three Wise Monkeys (hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil), their faces replaced with that of Mark Zuckerberg." src="https://craphound.com/images/15251188384_dc5504554e_o.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Facebook escalates war on accountability (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#quis-custodiet-ipsos-zuck"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Facebook just escalated its war on NYU's Ad Observer project, a project that monitors and discloses Facebook's failure to live up to its promise to block paid disinformation.
Here's how that works. Facebook users volunteer to download and install Ad Observer, a browser plugin. This plugin scrapes the ads Facebook shows that user. They are cleaned of any personally identifying information and uploaded to the Ad Observatory.
The Observatory is an archive that accountability journalists and researchers can mine to see whether FB is keeping its promises to label political ads and block paid disinformation. It's proof that FB does NOT live up to these promises.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/20/sovkitsch/#adobserver"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/20/sovkitsch/#adobserver&lt;/a&gt;
FB hates this. They threatened the NYU team with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, claiming that their violations of its terms of service violated this law (this is a gross overreach, and the law was since substantially narrowed by the Supreme Court):
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/04/aaronsw/#cfaa"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/04/aaronsw/#cfaa&lt;/a&gt;
At the same time, they waged a disinformation war against the project, falsely claiming that it was collecting Facebook users' data. The plugin is free/open source software and numerous experts have audited it and shown this is not true.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1422995760396726273"&gt;https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1422995760396726273&lt;/a&gt;
Which brings us to the latest salvo: FB has killed the accounts of Ad Observer's Laura Edelson and Damon McCoy, a move that severely restricts their ability to maintain Ad Observer and Ad Observatory.
&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/facebook-ad-observatory-nyu-researchers/"&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/facebook-ad-observatory-nyu-researchers/&lt;/a&gt;
The account terminations were accompanied by a renewed Facebook disinformation campaign that repeated the lie that Ad Observer was a privacy risk for FB users. It also repeated the lie that FB's own accountability archive was sufficient to monitor its anti-disinfo efforts.
Privacywashing is a cynical corporate tactic - when a company attacks its customers and critics in the name of privacy. Britons will remember the long years when companies justified brazen acts against their customers and justified by waving the Data Protection Act.
Privacywashing has only grown more widespread since then, and is especially present in the ongoing debate over antittrust and interoperability.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/interoperability-and-privacy"&gt;https://www.eff.org/wp/interoperability-and-privacy&lt;/a&gt;
Every time a company like FB dumps dox on hundreds of millions of uses, they spin that into a reason they should have &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; control over our lives.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/05/zucks-oily-rags/#into-the-breach"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/05/zucks-oily-rags/#into-the-breach&lt;/a&gt;
The reality is disinformation is really profitable for FB. I am skeptical about how well paid disinfo really works, but it's clear that there are lots of rich people who are convinced that it works, and they pay FB millions to try their hand at it.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/11/number-eight/#curse-of-bigness"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/11/number-eight/#curse-of-bigness&lt;/a&gt;
The fact of the matter is that FB is a company whose profits depend on hiding all kinds of fraud and sleaze from the public. That's why they gutted Crowtangle, the tool that researchers relied on for insight into the platform.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/15/three-wise-zucks-in-a-trenchcoat/#inconvenient-truth"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/15/three-wise-zucks-in-a-trenchcoat/#inconvenient-truth&lt;/a&gt;
The thing is, privacy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; very important, and we have to get it right. The worst part of privacywashing is that it discredits the very idea of privacy protection, makes people assume that every time they hear the word "privacy," they're about to be scammed.
This is parallel to the weaponization of "health and safety" in the UK, where cynical operators cited ill-defined "health and safety" regulations to let them boss people around, sell bogus services, and carve out lucrative careers as consultants.
&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2014/09/08/in-the-interests-of-safety-using-evidence-to-beat-back-security-theater/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2014/09/08/in-the-interests-of-safety-using-evidence-to-beat-back-security-theater/&lt;/a&gt;
The result was that the whole idea of safety regulation was put in bad odor, opening the door to all kinds of bad practices (including cladding tower-blocks in the kind of highly flammable materials that turned Greenfell into a charnel house).
In attacking Ad Observer, Facebook isn't just shooting the messenger - they're poisoning the well, sabotaging real privacy measures. It's another shameful chapter in the sordid tale of a company that shouldn't exist.

&lt;h1&gt;Disney stiffs writer (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/19/disneymustpay/#disneymustpay"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Alan Dean Foster is an sf legend - a writer who produced a shelf of original novels but also made a reputation novelizing movies and TV from Star Wars to Aliens, turning out books that transcended quickie adaptations, becoming beloved bestsellers in their own right.
Disney now owns a bunch of these books, thanks to their acquisitions of Lucas and Fox, and these books continue to sell briskly. Disney not only isn't paying Foster any royalties for these books - they're refusing to even issue him royalty statements.
&lt;a href="https://www.sfwa.org/2020/11/18/disney-must-pay/"&gt;https://www.sfwa.org/2020/11/18/disney-must-pay/&lt;/a&gt;
Disney has blackholed Foster's agents and lawyers, and also the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA); to the extent that they have communicated with him, they have espoused a radical (jaw dropping) copyright theory.
This is Disney's theory: When they bought Lucas and Fox, they acquired the copyright licenses that enabled them to sell the Foster's books - but not the liability, the legal obligation to pay him for his books.
As SFWA president Mary Robinette Kowal says, this theory could absolutely upend the nature of copyright itself. Any publisher that wanted to go on making money from an author without paying them could simply sell the rights to a sister company, which then denies any obligations.
Foster brought his case to SFWA's grievance committee - a group that has worked on my behalf in the past, extracting a fee from a multinational publisher that commissioned and accepted a story from me but then offered an odious and unacceptable contract they refused to amend.
Usually griefcom work happens in the background: a SFWA member goes to griefcom, griefcom goes to the publisher, the publisher settles. This is the first time in more than a decade that SFWA has gone public with a complaint.
To be fair, Disney &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; offer to meet with Foster, but demanded that he sign an NDA &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to any negotiation. This is Not Normal. Sometimes the OUTCOME of a negotiation is confidential, but you don't go into a negotiation under NDA.
Disney appears to be taking a page from the cartoonish villain Scooter Braun, who refused to meet with Taylor Swift about buying back the rights to her masters without an NDA.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425"&gt;https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425&lt;/a&gt;
Foster's case is a gross injustice. He has cancer and his wife is ill. He wrote these books, Disney bought them. They're making money from them. They owe him money. Period.
But beyond the individual injustice being visited upon Foster, Kowal and SFWA worry that this represents a suite of new, corporate anti-writer tactics: flipping assets without liabilities, refusing to talk about it without an NDA.
You can follow Foster's case with the #DisneyMustPay hashtag. If you're a writer facing similar tactics (even if you're not a SFWA member), they're seeking your story, via this form:

&lt;h1&gt;Tyson execs bet on covid spread in unsafe plant (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/19/disneymustpay/#you-bet-your-life"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Remember last April, when US meatpacking giants like Tyson were the epicenter of runaway superspreader events that slaughtered the poor, precarious, racialized workers who toiled under brutal and unsafe conditions?
One of the hardest-hit was Tyson's Waterloo, IA plant (the largest meat packing plant in America), where workers were denied PPE, forced to work without social distancing, and where more than 1,000 of them contracted covid. Many died.
One of the dead is Isidro Fernandez. In a wrongful death suit, his lawyers revealed details of Tyson's abuse of its workers that shock the conscience, like the fact that manager Tom Hart ran a betting pool on how many workers would contract covid.
&lt;a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/11/18/lawsuit-tyson-managers-bet-money-on-how-many-workers-would-contract-covid-19/"&gt;https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/11/18/lawsuit-tyson-managers-bet-money-on-how-many-workers-would-contract-covid-19/&lt;/a&gt;
The suit also claims senior manager John Casey told supervisors that they were required to report for work even if they had symptoms, calling covid a "glorified flu." He forced a supervisor to cancel a testing appointment, saying "We all have symptoms - you have a job to do."
A worker who was so sick he vomited on the line was ordered back to work the next day.
As conditions in the plant deteriorated, Tyson managers stopped visiting the floor altogether in a bid to protect themselves. Instead, they delegated to inexperienced supervisors.
They also told workers they would only be eligible for a $500 "thank you bonus" if they reported for every shift they were scheduled to work, regardless of whether they were sick and contagious.
All of this was justified - by Tyson and its enablers in the GOP - as a necessary, regrettable part of keeping America fed during the lockdown. But Tyson's breakneck meat-packing wasn't primarily domestic: they were serving the Chinese market.
Chinese meat-packers had largely been mothballed to spare workers from the virus; as a result, the company was able to increase its exports to China by 600% during Q1-2020.
But this isn't the story that Tyson's execs told Governor Kim Reynolds when they lobbied for exemptions from liability for the employees they maimed and murdered during the same period - they claimed it was all patriotic zeal to feed America.
The case has moved to federal court, thanks to Trump's invocation of the Defense Production Act, which ordered Tyson to stay open during the lockdown.

&lt;h1&gt;This is your brain on fraud apologetics (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In 1998, two Stanford students published a paper in &lt;em&gt;Computer Networks&lt;/em&gt; entitled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine," in which they wrote, "Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers."
&lt;a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub334/"&gt;https://research.google/pubs/pub334/&lt;/a&gt;
The co-authors were Lawrence Page and Sergey Brin, and the "large-scale hypertextual web search-engine" they were describing was their new project, which they called "Google." They were 100% correct - prescient, even!
On Wednesday night, a friend came over to watch some TV with us. We ordered out. We got scammed. We searched for a great local Thai place we like called Kiin and clicked a sponsored link for a Wix site called "Kiinthaila.com." We should have clicked the third link down (kiinthaiburbank.com).
We got scammed. The Wix site was a lookalike for Kiin Thai, which marked up their prices by 15% and relayed the order to our local, mom-and-pop, one-branch restaurant. The restaurant knew it, too - they called us and told us they were canceling the order, and said we could still come get our food, but we'd have to call Amex to reverse the charge.
As it turned out, the scammers double-billed us for our order. I called Amex, who advised us to call back in a couple days when the charge posted to cancel it - in other words, they were treating it as a regular customer dispute, and not a systemic, widespread fraud (there's no way this scammer is just doing this for one restaurant).
In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor hassle, but boy, it's haunting to watch the quarter-century old prophecy of Brin and Page coming true. Search Google for carpenters, plumbers, gas-stations, locksmiths, concert tickets, entry visas, jobs at the US Post Office or (not making this up) tech support for Google products, and the top result will be a paid ad for a scam. Sometimes it's several of the top ads.
This kind of "intermediation" business is actually revered in business-schools. As Douglas Rushkoff has written, the modern business wisdom reveres "going meta" - not doing anything useful, but rather, creating a chokepoint between people who do useful things and people who want to pay for those things, and squatting there, collecting rent:

It's the ultimate passive income/rise and grind side-hustle: It wouldn't surprise me in the least to discover a whole festering nest of creeps on Tiktok talking about how they pay Mechanical Turks to produce these lookalike sites at scale.
This mindset is so pervasive that people running companies with billions in revenue and massive hoards of venture capital run &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same scam. During lockdown, companies like Doordash, Grubhub and Uber Eats stood up predatory lookalike websites for local restaurants, without their consent, and played monster-in-the-middle, tricking diners into ordering through them:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle&lt;/a&gt;
These delivery app companies were playing a classic enshittification game: first they directed surpluses to customers to lock them in (heavily discounting food), then they directed surplus to restaurants (preferential search results, free delivery, low commissions) - then, having locked in both consumers and producers, they harvested the surplus for themselves.
Today, delivery apps charge massive premiums to both eaters and restaurants, load up every order with junk fees, and clone the most successful restaurants out of ghost kitchens - shipping containers in parking lots crammed with low-waged workers cranking out orders for 15 different fake "virtual restaurants":
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/01/autophagic-buckeyes/#subsidized-autophagia"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/01/autophagic-buckeyes/#subsidized-autophagia&lt;/a&gt;
Delivery apps speedran the enshittification cycle, but Google took a slower path to get there. The company has locked in billions of users (e.g. by paying billions to be the default search on Safari and Firefox and using legal bullying to block third party Android device-makers from pre-installing browsers other than Chrome). For years, it's been leveraging our lock-in to prey on small businesses, getting them to set up Google Business Profiles.
These profiles are supposed to help Google distinguish between real sellers and scammers. But Kiin Thai has a Google Business Profile, and searching for "kiin thai burbank" brings up a "Knowledge Panel" with the correct website address - on a page that is headed with a link to a &lt;em&gt;scam&lt;/em&gt; website for the same business. Google, in other words, has everything it needs to flag lookalike sites and confirm them with their registered owners. It would cost Google money to do this - engineer-time to build and maintain the system, content moderator time to manually check flagged listings, and lost ad-revenue from scammers - but letting the scams flourish makes Google money, at the expense of Google users and Google business customers.
Now, Google has an answer for this: they tell merchants who are being impersonated by ad-buying scammers that all they need to do is outbid them for the top ad-spot. This is a common approach - Amazon has a $31b/year "ad business" that's mostly its own platform sellers bidding against each other to show you fake results for your query. The first five screens of Amazon search results are 50% ads:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/28/enshittification/#relentless-payola"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/28/enshittification/#relentless-payola&lt;/a&gt;
This is "going meta," so naturally, Meta is doing it too: Facebook and Instagram have announced a $12/month "verification" badge that will let you report impersonation and tweak the algorithm to make it more likely that the posts you make are shown to the people who explicitly asked to see them:
&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/2/21/23609375/meta-verified-twitter-blue-checkmark-badge-instagram-facebook"&gt;https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/2/21/23609375/meta-verified-twitter-blue-checkmark-badge-instagram-facebook&lt;/a&gt;
The corollary of this, of course, is that if you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; pay, they &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; police your impersonators, and they &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; show your posts to the people who asked to see them. This is pure enshittification - the surplus from users and business customers is harvested for the benefit of the platform owners:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys&lt;/a&gt;
The idea that merchants should master the platforms as a means of keeping us safe from their impersonators is a hollow joke. For one thing, the rules change all the time, as the platforms endlessly twiddle the knobs that determine what gets shown to whom:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/twiddler-1b5c9690cce6&lt;/a&gt;
And they refuse to tell anyone what the rules are, because if they told you what the rules were, you'd be able to bypass them. Content moderation is the only infosec domain where "security through obscurity" doesn't get laughed out of the room:
&lt;a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/como-is-infosec-307f87004563"&gt;https://doctorow.medium.com/como-is-infosec-307f87004563&lt;/a&gt;
Worse: the one thing the platforms &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; hunt down and exterminate with extreme prejudice is anything that users or business-customers use to twiddle &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; - add-ons and plugins and jailbreaks that override their poor choices with better ones:
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378541/the-og-app-instagram-clone-pulled-from-app-store"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378541/the-og-app-instagram-clone-pulled-from-app-store&lt;/a&gt;
As I was submitting complaints about the fake Kiin scam-site (and Amex's handling of my fraud call) to the FTC, the California Attorney General, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and Wix, I wrote a little Twitter thread about what a gross scam this is:
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1628948906657878016"&gt;https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1628948906657878016&lt;/a&gt;
The thread got more than two million reads and got picked up by Hacker News and other sites. While most of the responses evinced solidarity and frustration and recounted similar incidents in other domains, a significant plurality of the replies were scam apologetics - messages from people who wanted to explain why this wasn't a problem after all.
The most common of these was victim-blaming: "you should have used an adblocker" or "never click the sponsored link." Of course, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use an ad-blocker - but this order was placed with a mobile browser, after an absentminded query into the Google search-box permanently placed on the home screen, which opens results in Chrome (where I don't have an ad-blocker, so I can see material behind an ad-blocker-blocker), not Firefox (which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have an ad-blocker).
Now, I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; have a PiHole on my home LAN, which blocks most ads even in a default browser - but earlier this day, I'd been on a public wifi network that was erroneously blocking a website (the always excellent superpunch.net) so I'd turned my wifi off, which meant the connection came over my phone's 5G connection, bypassing the PiHole:
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/28/shut-yer-pi-hole/"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/28/shut-yer-pi-hole/&lt;/a&gt;
"Don't click a sponsored link" - well, the irony here is that if you habitually use a browser with an ad-blocker, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you backstop it with a PiHole, you &lt;em&gt;never see sponsored links&lt;/em&gt;, so it's easy to miss the tiny "Sponsored" notification beside the search result. That goes double if you're relaxing with a dinner guest on the sofa and ordering dinner while chatting.
There's a name for this kind of security failure: the Swiss Cheese Model. We all have multiple defenses (in my case: foreknowledge of Google's ad-scam problem, an ad-blocker in my browser, LAN-wide ad sinkholing). We also have multiple vulnerabilities (in my case: forgetting I was on 5G, being distracted by conversation, using a mobile device with a permanent insecure search bar on the homescreen, and being so accustomed to ad-blocked results that I got out of the habit of checking whether a result was an ad).
If you think you aren't vulnerable to scams, you're wrong - and your confidence in your invulnerability actually &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; your risk. This isn't the first time I've been scammed, and it won't be the last - and every time, it's been a Swiss Cheese failure, where all the holes in all my defenses lined up for a brief instant and left me vulnerable:
&lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2010/05/cory-doctorow-persistence-pays-parasites/"&gt;https://locusmag.com/2010/05/cory-doctorow-persistence-pays-parasites/&lt;/a&gt;
Other apologetics: "just call the restaurant rather than using its website." Look, I know the people who say this don't think I have a time-machine I can use to travel back to the 1980s and retrieve a Yellow Pages, but it's hard not to snark at them, just the same. Scammers don't just set up fake websites for your local businesses - they staff them with fake call-centers, too. The same search that takes you to a fake website will also take you to a fake phone number.
Finally, there's "What do you expect Google to do? They can't possibly detect this kind of scam." But they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, they are better situated to discover these scams than anyone else, because they have their business profiles, with verified contact information for the merchants being impersonated. When they get an ad that seems to be for the same business but to a different website, they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; interrupt the ad process to confirm it with their verified contact info.
Instead, they choose to avoid the expense, and pocket the ad revenue. If a company promises to "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," I think we have the right to demand these kinds of basic countermeasures:
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/our-approach/"&gt;https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/our-approach/&lt;/a&gt;
The same goes for Amex: when a merchant is scamming customers, they shouldn't treat complaints as "chargebacks" - they should treat them as reports of a crime in progress. Amex has the bird's eye view of their transaction flow and when a customer reports a scam, they can backtrack it to see if the same scammer is doing this with other merchants - but the credit card companies make money by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; chasing down fraud:
&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosalindadams/mastercard-visa-fraud"&gt;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosalindadams/mastercard-visa-fraud&lt;/a&gt;
Wix also has platform-scale analytics that they could use to detect and interdict this kind of fraud - when a scammer creates a hundred lookalike websites for restaurants and uses Wix's merchant services to process payments for them, that could trigger human review - but it didn't.
Where do all of these apologetics come from? Why are people so eager to leap to the defense of scammers and their adtech and fintech enablers? Why is there such an impulse to victim-blame?
I think it's fear: in their hearts, people - especially techies - know that they, too, are vulnerable to these ripoffs, but they don't want to admit it. They want to convince themselves that the person who got scammed made an easily avoidable mistake, and that they themselves will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; make a similar mistake.
This is doubly true for readerships on tech-heavy forums like Twitter or (especially) Hacker News. These readers know just how many vulnerabilities there are - how many holes are in their Swiss cheese - and they are also overexposed to rise-and-grind/passive income rhetoric.
This produces a powerful cognitive dissonance: "If all the 'entrepreneurs' I worship are just laying traps for the unwary, and if I am sometimes unwary, then I'm cheering on the authors of my future enduring misery." The only way to resolve this dissonance - short of re-evaluating your view of platform capitalism or questioning your own immunity to scams - is to blame the victim.
The median Hacker News reader has to somehow resolve the tension between "just install an adblocker" and "Chrome's extension sandbox is a dumpster fire and it's basically impossible to know whether any add-on you install can steal every keystroke and all your other data":
&lt;a href="https://mattfrisbie.substack.com/p/spy-chrome-extension"&gt;https://mattfrisbie.substack.com/p/spy-chrome-extension&lt;/a&gt;
In my Twitter thread, I called this "the worst of all possible timelines." Everything we do is mediated by gigantic, surveillant monopolists that spy on us comprehensively from asshole to appetite - but none of them, not a 20th century payment giant nor a 21st century search giant - can bestir itself to use that data to keep us safe from scams.

I love "tensegrity" - Buckminster Fuller's structures that use tension, not compression, to support loads. You may have seen this amazing, nigh-sorcerous tensegrity Lego build that Jason Kottke recently highlighted.
&lt;a href="https://jkbrickworks.com/tensegrity-sculpture/"&gt;https://jkbrickworks.com/tensegrity-sculpture/&lt;/a&gt;
Writing in Wired, Rhett Allain offers an accessible, plain-language explanation for how tensegrity works, along with guidance for improvising your own tensegrity projects at home.
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wait-that-table-has-no-legs/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/wait-that-table-has-no-legs/&lt;/a&gt;
"Whereas an ordinary table stays up because the tabletop pushes down with the weight of gravity on some rigid legs, this one is held together by a balance of forces pulling in different directions. Those strings on the left are actually pulling up!"

&lt;h1&gt;I'm doing a livecast today for Podapalooza (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/25/send-pics/#podapalooza"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Today is the second day of the Podapalooza virtual podcasting festival! It launched yesterday with the first hour of my new reading of my 2009 novel "Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town."
&lt;a href="https://www.podapalooza.org/"&gt;https://www.podapalooza.org/&lt;/a&gt;
It's a novel about a guy who is obsessed with building a citywide, free wireless network - whose parents happen to be a mountain and a washing machine. Gene Wolf (RIP) called it "a glorious book unlike any book you've read."
&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/someone/"&gt;https://craphound.com/someone/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/81E7oTyDv7L.jpg"&gt;
As part of the festival, I'm doing a live Q&amp;amp;A; today at 11AM Pacific/2PM Eastern. The tickets are pay-what-you-can, and the funds go to benefit Give Directly, which makes direct cash-transfers to families in dire straits due to coronavirus.
If you want a superb, professional reading of the novel, the official audiobook is amazing, read by Bronson Pinchot. You can buy it anywhere audiobooks are sold (except Audible, who refuse to carry my work because it's DRM-free), or direct from me:

&lt;h1&gt;The vernacular signage of the pandemic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/25/send-pics/#frankfurt"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
I have always been fascinated with public signage; the signs we post are a window into what we secretly think that other people don't know or understand. I've posted literally thousands of pictures of signs from all over the world.
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=37996580417%40N01&amp;amp;amp;text;=sign"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=37996580417%40N01&amp;amp;amp;text;=sign&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/covidflickrsigns.jpg"&gt;
The pandemic has ushered in a golden age of signage, with people pressed to create vernacular, often hand-lettered (or home-printed) signage to announce closures or demand attention to public health measures.
Philipp Lenssen has been documenting the covid signage in Frankfurt and has posted 800+ photos under permissive licenses permitting commercial re-use.
&lt;a href="http://coronabrowser.com/"&gt;http://coronabrowser.com/&lt;/a&gt;
He'd like to expand the collection. If you have pics you'd like him to add, email philipp.lenssen@gmail.com.

&lt;h1&gt;A deflationary pandemic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/25/send-pics/#fiscal-dominance"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
As central banks around the world fire up the money printers, it's natural to worry that the pandemic will trigger runaway inflation.
But as MIT economist Olivier Blanchard writes in Vox EU, there's a much larger risk of &lt;em&gt;de&lt;/em&gt;flation.
&lt;a href="https://voxeu.org/article/there-deflation-or-inflation-our-future"&gt;https://voxeu.org/article/there-deflation-or-inflation-our-future&lt;/a&gt;
After all, unemployment is skyrocketing, anyone with money is halting all discretionary spending to save for an uncertain future, and even if they wanted to spend, there's no open stores to spend &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;.
After the pandemic, our collective trauma and financial anxiety could usher in a new era of saving and debt-aversion, halting the debt-fuelled consumer spending that has sustained much of the world's economy for the past 40 years.
Blanchard makes a good case that we should be worried about deflation, though he does acknowledge that we're in a "nonstandard environment" where it's hard to predict how the economy will move.
He posits at least one hyperinflationary scenario, in which we see a spike in private debt, larger than the 20-30% already projected; a large increase in the neutral rate; and "fiscal dominance of monetary policy."
This last is what happens when the Fed refuses to raise rates because of political pressure from overleveraged debtors who can't afford higher interest, creating "overheating and inflation."
Blanchard says that this scenario only occurs if three low-probability events all occur, and thus the overall outcome is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unlikely.

&lt;h1&gt;Makers in a time of pandemic (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/25/send-pics/#makers"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
A funny thing happened on the way to the pandemic. Neoliberalism's imperative to look only at how things work (not how they fail) created lean, overstretched supply chains that allowed investors to extract huge surpluses from companies (AKA: why everything is made in China).
But even as distributed, local productive capacities around the world were being dismantled (redundancy != inefficiency), the maker movement was on the rise, expressing a kind of inchoate urge to be able to make, fix and improve things close to home.
&lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90489974/the-maker-faire-spirit-is-helping-the-world-tackle-the-covid-19-crisis"&gt;https://www.fastcompany.com/90489974/the-maker-faire-spirit-is-helping-the-world-tackle-the-covid-19-crisis&lt;/a&gt;
And today, the gaps in the supply chain are being filled by the makers inspired by Make Magazine, Maker Faire, and the new DIY movement.
I've long been fascinated by the way that modern makerism diverges from the old DIY/hobbyist movement of the Modern Mechanix era. The key difference is networked collaboration: if I have a project idea or question, I can easily locate similar projects for inspiration.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/xlg_cover.jpg"&gt;
Then I can ask questions and solicit suggestions from ad-hoc communities clustered around projects similar to mine; the electronic, written nature of these brainstorming sessions means that they form a permanent palipmsest that future makers can refer to.
In addition to shopcraft and praxis spreading shoulder-to-shoulder in workshops (which happens in makerspaces, obvs), there's this invisible, massive continuous knowledge-transfer happening across time and space, thanks to networks.
Today, we see that happening at speed, as plans, techniques, sources and improvements fly around the world at network speed, with makers taking on both production and maintenance of medical and safety equipment.
Meanwhile, the medtech companies that treated service, parts, schematics and technical documentation as trade-secrets that secured a proprietary market advantage have taken a massive beating as the failings of this model were made manifest.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/15/invigilation/#loz-im-gain"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/15/invigilation/#loz-im-gain&lt;/a&gt;
The pressure has taken its toll: the biggest ventilator companies in the world are opening up their document repositories to enable local repair and maintenance.
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/884zvx/ventilator-companies-finally-make-the-life-saving-devices-easier-to-repair"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/884zvx/ventilator-companies-finally-make-the-life-saving-devices-easier-to-repair&lt;/a&gt;
It's by no means complete, but it's a start. And in the meanwhile, guerilla efforts like Ifixit's repository of med-tech service manuals and documentation are filling in the gaps.
&lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/36354/help-us-crowdsource-repair-information-for-hospital-equipment"&gt;https://www.ifixit.com/News/36354/help-us-crowdsource-repair-information-for-hospital-equipment&lt;/a&gt;

I've been a fan of Lauren McLaughin's writing since her outstanding debut novel, Cycler, an allegorical YA sf novel about a young woman who turns into a boy for 5 days out of 28:
&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2008/08/26/cycler-smart-ya-nove.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2008/08/26/cycler-smart-ya-nove.html&lt;/a&gt;
McLaughlin has written in so many modes since, and done so well with each. She reminds me of Kathe Koja or Neil Gaiman, a writer of incredible versatility who writes for kids and adults with equal facility, crossing back and forth from sf to mimetic fiction to fantsy.
Her new novel is superb: SEND PICS is a cyber-heist book whose mechanics turn on the same kind of taut smart-versus-outsmart that made John Rogers's Leverage such a treat.
&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2020/04/21/merciless-teens.html"&gt;https://boingboing.net/2020/04/21/merciless-teens.html&lt;/a&gt;
But what makes SEND PICS really incredible is how it marries that heist-novel tension with deadly serious subject matter: it's a book about a young woman who is drugged, sexually assaulted, and then extorted by her abuser.
McLaughlin's balancing act between these two modes shows off that rare, writerly versatility: this is a book that's on the one hand deadly serious, and on the other hand, a plot-driven romp, and it manages this feat without trivializing its subject or sacrificing its gusto.
On the way, SEND PICS connect patriarchy with inequality, white supremacy, and allyship. It's a gorgeous story of beautiful friendships, a tight tale of justice and comeuppance, and a technothriller of great drive.

&lt;h1&gt;A grifter's border wall is about to fall into the Rio Grande (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/02/big-river/#god-hates-walls"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Headlines are hard, but every now and again, someone just &lt;em&gt;nails it&lt;/em&gt;, like whoever wrote this Propublica hed: "He Built a Privately Funded Border Wall. It’s Already at Risk of Falling Down if Not Fixed," over a story by Jeremy Schwartz and Perla Trevizo.
&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/he-built-a-privately-funded-border-wall-its-already-at-risk-of-falling-down-if-not-fixed"&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/he-built-a-privately-funded-border-wall-its-already-at-risk-of-falling-down-if-not-fixed&lt;/a&gt;
That hed captures so much about the story, but read it all anyway, so you can learn how Tommy Fisher, a trumpy grifter, conned the USG out of &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; to build border walls by going on Fox News to talk up his incredible, red-tape-cutting prowess.
Fisher's showroom is "the Lamborghini of walls" (now &lt;em&gt;there's&lt;/em&gt; an American comparison!) that he privately built on the banks of the Rio Grande, which won him $1.7B+ in federal wall-building contracts in Arizona.
But Fisher somehow didn't realize that the Rio Grande was a, uh, BIG river, and that it would quickly erode the footings of his Italian sportscar of a wall, putting it at risk of being swept into the Gulf of Mexico (hey, there's some irony for ya!).
Now, say what you will about the US government, it was able to tell that Fisher was a dangerous grifter from the get-go. Fisher was rejected by the DHS and Army Corps of Engineers, but he had a canny strategy.
By repeatedly going on Fox News and talking up his skills, he convinced Trump himself to get him put on the list of qualified bidders.
It was Fisher's imperilled wall that won him Trump's approval, because, apart from the fact that it is about to be washed away to sea, it was perfect in every respect.
It was funded by donations from "We Build the Wall," a money-sink for gullible xenophobes overseen by Tom Tancredo, David Clarke, Kris Kobach and Steve Bannon.
Its founder, Brian Kolfage, talked up how it could be built better and cheaper than anything a USG egghead would design: "The best engineers in the world designed this for floods, not government employees." That's some powerful Lyle Lanley Monorail vibe right there.
Anyway, now it's going to be washed away. Perhaps it will form a useful artificial reef? Or maybe it will lodge across the river and provide a handy footbridge for asylum seekers?

&lt;h1&gt;Hong Kong law threatens people all over the world (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/02/big-river/#be-water"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
A year ago, it seemed the whole world was glued to the incredible protests out of Hong Kong, which were a masterclass in both street- and cyber-countermeasures, as Hong Kong people bootstrapped a protest over a bad law into a popular independence movement.
But Beijing outwaited the protesters. The new "National Security Law" goes far further than the extradition law that kicked off last year's #612strike, and it passed on Jun 30.
Incredibly, the text of the law was kept secret from the public &lt;em&gt;and Hong Kong's lawmakers&lt;/em&gt; (including Chief Exec Carrie Lam) until moments before its passage.
&lt;a href="https://www.chinalawblog.com/2020/07/requiem-for-hong-kong.html"&gt;https://www.chinalawblog.com/2020/07/requiem-for-hong-kong.html&lt;/a&gt;
The law imposes life sentences for four nebulously defined offenses ("secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and collusion with foreign entities"), and provides for secret, jury-less trials that needn't be held in Hong Kong.
&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/01/885900989/5-takeaways-from-chinas-hong-kong-national-security-law"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2020/07/01/885900989/5-takeaways-from-chinas-hong-kong-national-security-law&lt;/a&gt;
The law also mandates "national security education" in Hong Kong schools, with Beijing-designed curriculum, finally implementing an unpopular 2012 law that was defeated after public opposition.
It also implements 2016's failed proposal to require HK lawmakers to swear loyalty oaths to Beijing. It prohibits the mainstream opposition movements in HK.
The law permits Chinese forces to kidnap anyone, anywhere - whether or not they are from or reside in HK or are Chinese or HK nationals - to face punishment.
You may remember that in 2018, Chinese authorities kidnapped dissident booksellers and brought them to the mainland so that their coerced apologies for their opposition to the Xi regime could be broadcast around the world.
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/magazine/the-case-of-hong-kongs-missing-booksellers.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/magazine/the-case-of-hong-kongs-missing-booksellers.html&lt;/a&gt;
Arrests under the new law have already begun, including a 15-year-old girl arrested for waving a pro-independence flag at a demonstration.

&lt;h1&gt;1000+ accidental trigger-phrases for smart speakers (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/02/big-river/#triggered"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In "Unacceptable, where is my privacy?" - a forthcoming computer science paper - a group of researchers from Ruhr University Bochum and the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy identify 1000+ keywords that can erroneously wake smart speakers.
&lt;a href="https://unacceptable-privacy.github.io/"&gt;https://unacceptable-privacy.github.io/&lt;/a&gt;
When that happens the speakers begin to capture sound from around them and transmit it to the corporations that manufactured them, who both retain the accidental audio and periodically transmit it to subcontractors who review and transcribe the audio.
&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/uncovered-1000-phrases-that-incorrectly-trigger-alexa-siri-and-google-assistant/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/uncovered-1000-phrases-that-incorrectly-trigger-alexa-siri-and-google-assistant/&lt;/a&gt;
Many accidental wake-words are commonly spoken in radio, TV and podcasts, and are a part of typical conversations, meaning that anyone who owns a smart speaker is likely frequently uninentionally triggering it.
For example, saying the world "Election" can wake your Alexa.
While the companies' practices (retaining and retransmitting captured speech) make this worse, it's bad on its own, and the best fix for it is to not own any of these devices, period.

&lt;h1&gt;Roller derby's brilliant re-opening plan (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/02/big-river/#derby"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Sport leagues all over the world are wrestling (!) with how and when to reopen. Mostly they're doing a terrible job, with one amazing, shining exception: roller-derby.
The Women’s Flat Track Derby Association's guidelines, developed by a group of athlete-experts, are amazing.
&lt;a href="https://static.wftda.com/files/covid-19/WFTDA-COVID-Return-To-Play-Plan-v1.pdf"&gt;https://static.wftda.com/files/covid-19/WFTDA-COVID-Return-To-Play-Plan-v1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
As Christie Aschwanden writes in Wired, the plan has won praise from epidemiologists for "its specific and data-based benchmarks, for its grounding in science and 'basic infection-control principles.'"
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/womens-roller-derby-has-a-plan-for-covid-and-it-kicks-ass/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/womens-roller-derby-has-a-plan-for-covid-and-it-kicks-ass/&lt;/a&gt;
Its obvious superiority has attracted attention from all sorts of sports leagues, all over the world.
Most importantly is its relationship to local infection conditions, using local public health guidelines as benchmarks for seven stages of re-opening for Derby.
Tier 1 ("limited group practices...with no physical contact between players") is permissible when health authorities lift "stay-at-home orders or proximity restrictions," permit "public congregations of at least 50 people" where "public transportation is fully functional."
Beyond that, Tier 1 can only occur when there have been fewer than 5 positive cases per 10,000 people for at least 14 days.
Each tier steps through its own benchmarks, but even more importantly, new conditions automatically trigger reversion to stricter tiers.
Included in the guidelines are rules for when and how audiences can return to matches, praised by Emory University epidemiologist Zachary Binney: "It’s so nice to see a clear, unambiguously right take."
While the guidelines are highly specific and thoughtful, the principles that guide them are admirably succinct: "See what’s happening, take small steps, step off whenever something is concerning." - Biostatistician Mikaela Kosich (derby name: Bubble Wrath).

&lt;h1&gt;Unauthorized seat (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/02/big-river/#beemers"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In my novella Unauthorized Bread, I explore how "smart" devices can be turned into rent-extraction services, enabling firms to convert the property we own into systems that we license, with the terms renegotiable at any moment.
&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/&lt;/a&gt;
Under these conditions, companies can realize the age-old monopolist's dream of controlling their risk by unilaterally imposing restraints on their competitors, customers and critics.
And since laws like Section 1201 of the DMCA ban tampering with these enforcement systems, firms can literally make it a crime to displease their shareholders - it's "Felony Contempt of Business-Model."
For example, a company can define some of the value you get out of your property (like using ink of your own choosing in your printer) as a "feature" and charge anything they want for it. They can also cancel that feature if they decide it's not good for them anymore.
And since laws (like copyright and patent) prohibit third parties from making interoperable products that can restore the feature - a mod-chip, a third-party ink cartridge, a plug-in - companies get to decide who can compete with them and how.
Say you make a mobile phone and you want your customers to throw away their devices and buy new ones every two years: you can design the phone so that repairing it requires bypassing a copyright lock.
That makes it a crime for anyone except you to fix that phone, and you can decline to fix phones that are more than two years old. Anyone who attempts a competing, unauthorized repair breaks the law.
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmd9a5/tim-cook-to-investors-people-bought-fewer-new-iphones-because-they-repaired-their-old-ones"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmd9a5/tim-cook-to-investors-people-bought-fewer-new-iphones-because-they-repaired-their-old-ones&lt;/a&gt;
But remember, this Felony Contempt of Business Model isn't just a license to dictate how your competitors and customers must act - it also allows you to muzzle your critics.
Digital systems contain subtle and potentially lethal security defects. The most reliable way for these defects to be discovered and repaired is for independent third parties to conduct unauthorized, unconstrained audits of products we trust with our data and even our lives.
In particular, companies should never - for obvious reasons - get a say in who can tell the public about defects in their products or how they can say it. Companies are not neutral custodians of true disclosures regarding expensive mistakes they made.
When companies uses digital locks to restrict access to code in their devices, they can use these laws to punish people both for researching their products and for disclosing what they find.
EFF is suing the US government to end this.

When corporations have the right to control their critics, customers and competitors, we have no hope for technological self-determination - the right to decide which technology we use and how we use it.
So of course, corporations love this. It's a way to make money by bullying your customers, rather than by wooing them with your amazing products.
Oh hai, BMW.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/bmw-vehicle-as-a-platform"&gt;https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/bmw-vehicle-as-a-platform&lt;/a&gt;
BMW is reinventing their cars as a "platform" - that is, a device where they (and they alone) can arbitrarily add or remove features at any price they choose, subject only to terms of service whose only option is "I agree" or "I no longer have a car."
Which over-the-air "options" will BMWs have? "Everything from advanced safety systems like adaptive cruise and automatic high-beams to other, more discrete options like heated seats."
"Imagine pressing the seat heater button only to be prompted to renew your subscription, or having to pay extra to get an engine note on your new M4 that suits your sensibilities. All this is possible -- and likely. And, frankly, ugly." -Tim Stevens, Cnet
Stevens is right, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. Implicit in car-as-platform is car-as-monopoly-platform, car-as-company-store. This only works if BMW's competitors are prohibited from simply unlocking this functionality.
That is, it only works if BMW - and not you - get to decide which software runs in your car. This may sound like a safety feature but having the power to load and unload the code in every BMW guarantees that governments will order BMW to do so when it suits their needs.
This is the lesson Apple learned when it made a phone that Apple - and Apple alone - could approve software for. The murderous Chinese government showed up and said, "Remove any software that makes it impossible to spy on our people."

If you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do it, someone might &lt;em&gt;make you&lt;/em&gt; do it.

&lt;h1&gt;Don't Believe Proven Liars (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/02/big-river/#"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
One of the commonest ways for competitive market economies to turn into monopolies is when companies are allowed to merge with major competitors or acquire new companies that might grow to threaten them.
This leads to "moneyball" markets where companies grow because they have money, not because they make things we love.
In the pre-Reagan era, it was routine for the DoJ to block mergers on this basis but in the decades since, the DoJ has moved to a posture of permitting even the most indefensible mergers to monopoly.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-blatantly-anticompetitive"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-blatantly-anticompetitive&lt;/a&gt;
The DoJ's position is that all it needs to do to keep monopolists from abusing their power is to tie merger permission to good conduct promises - like Facebook's promise that it would not combine Instagram and Whatsapp data with its other sources.
&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brian-acton-whatsapp-on-facebook-forbes-interview-today-2018-09-26/"&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brian-acton-whatsapp-on-facebook-forbes-interview-today-2018-09-26/&lt;/a&gt;
This is a poor substitute for simply blocking monopolies.
Which is bad enough, but it gets worse.
Companies routinely lie about what they will and won't do after a merger.
Which is bad enough, but it gets worse.
Even &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; a company has lied in order to get a merger past the DoJ, the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; companies are allowed to tell the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; lies when they're attempting their next merger.
And their next.
And their next.
As GW Bush said, "Fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again."
In a new post for EFF Deeplinks, I propose the absolute minimum standard of prudence in merger scrutiny:
"If a company breaks a promise, and then it makes the same promise when seeking approval for a merger, we should not believe it."

&lt;h1&gt;The Americans (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/31/walkies/#among-us"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The West End Phoenix is home-delivered Toronto print newspaper published by Canadian music legend Dave Bidini (cofounder of The Rheostatics). The current issue is called "The Americans" and it tells the story of Americans who emigrated to Canada.
&lt;a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/the-americans"&gt;https://www.westendphoenix.com/the-americans&lt;/a&gt;
It's a series of beautifully told stories about people whose love of the land of their birth was overshadowed by the terror and precarity of US racial and economic and gender warfare against its own people.
They're love letters to the people these ex-Americans left behind, the family and friends they fear for, amid guns and conspiracies, health care gouging and unlimited economic cruelty. Their testimonials describe how much easier it is to live the American dream in Canada.
"Having lived on both sides of the border, Canada simply offers a lot more support for regular people and as a result a lot more opportunity." -Tim Ellis, US military veteran
&lt;a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/tim-ellis"&gt;https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/tim-ellis&lt;/a&gt;
"Nobody asks me why I don’t wish to live in America anymore." -Brad Wheeler
&lt;a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/brad-wheeler"&gt;https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/brad-wheeler&lt;/a&gt;
"If Trump gets four more years, I’ll be among those who will aid American citizens crossing the border and making Canada home, just as they did in the ’60s when the draft dodgers came." -Joanne Smale
&lt;a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/joanne-smale"&gt;https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/joanne-smale&lt;/a&gt;
"I wonder, if Trump gets elected, how many more people will die, and whether they will be the people I love." -Valerie Hunter
&lt;a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/valerie-hunter"&gt;https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/valerie-hunter&lt;/a&gt;
"I miss the U.S. itself: a nation that put a man on the moon not two months after I was born now rejects science. I am ashamed for myself, and afraid for us all." -Andrew Sullivan
&lt;a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/andrew-sullivan"&gt;https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/andrew-sullivan&lt;/a&gt;
"People expected Trump to be maybe a rodeo clown or game show host, not a despot. A matinee grifter. Trump sucks the good life out of us." -Bill King, Vietnam draft-dodger
&lt;a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/bill-king"&gt;https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/bill-king&lt;/a&gt;
"In each family meeting, there’s a lot of talking over one another, saying how much we love each other, then about how angry we are at the president and the evil motherfuckers enabling the traitor." -Maureen Honore
&lt;a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/maureen-honore"&gt;https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/maureen-honore&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Shanghai's walking building (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/31/walkies/#city-come-a-walkin"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Shanghai's Lagena Primary School is a 5-story, 76 kiloton 85-year-old T-shaped structure that was rotated 21' and relocated 62m down the road over 18 days by means of "walking machines."
&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/shanghai-relocate-building-preservation-intl-hnk-scli/index.html"&gt;https://www.cnn.com/style/article/shanghai-relocate-building-preservation-intl-hnk-scli/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
These are 198 sensor-studded, actuating mobile supports that alternately raised and lowered in two groups, allowing the building to slowly shuffle around and manoeuvrer into its new position.
The legs were installed by workers who excavated around and beneath the structure, relying on its existing support pillars to support it; when the legs were in place, the pillars were sawn through.
The success of the walking machines is heralded as a reprieve for China's older buildings, which have been razed in vast numbers to clear the way for high-density urban expansions, ending the post-Mao vogue for architectural preservation.
The novel I'm working on now, "The Lost Cause," is a post-GND utopian story about truth and reconciliation with white nationalist militias who lost the war on the planet and its life.

It turns on all kinds of urbanist stuff like this, as people roll up their sleeves and embark on hugely ambitious climate remediation and adaptation projects, like relocating every coastal city ~20km inland.

This kind of stuff absolutely skewers me: whole buildings on the move. It gives me hope that our historic structures may survive as more than future marine habitats.

&lt;h1&gt;Attack Surface in Wired (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/12/redeeming-hackers/#origin-stories"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
My next book, Attack Surface - AKA Little Brother 3  - drops in the US/Canada tomorrow (it's came out in other English-speaking countries on Oct 1) and today, Wired's Andy Greenberg published his review of the series and the new book.
It's excellent.
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/his-writing-radicalized-young-hackers-now-he-wants-to-redeem-them/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/his-writing-radicalized-young-hackers-now-he-wants-to-redeem-them/&lt;/a&gt;
Attack Surface is a standalone Little Brother book for adults, telling the story of Masha Maximow, a complicated sometimes-villain from the first two Little Brother books. While Marcus Yallow spends those books fighting surveillance, Masha is one of the people building in.
At first, Masha feels like she has good reasons for doing what she does, redirecting her trauma of living through a terrorist attack into making her city and country safer.
But as she moves from the DHS to some Beltway Bandits contracting in an Iraq Forward Operations Base, hunting insurgents, she increasingly turns to compartmentalization and rationalization as a means of living with her own reflection in the mirror.
Finally, she finds herself in the former USSR, where a new employer puts her to work spying on pro-democracy activists for brutal oligarchs, and to assuage her conscience, she moonlights teaching those same activists to resist her employer's surveillance gear.
This self-destructive behavior can't last long - as Masha flees her (former) employer's wrath, she returns to San Francisco, where her childhood best friend is now a racial justice organizer being targeted by the cyberweapons Masha herself built.
What follows is the story of Masha's moral reckoning, and moral reckonings are the theme of Greenberg's piece: after all, Little Brother and Homeland inspired a legion of pro-user, anti-surveillance technologists and activists.
But it also led plenty of people into tech careers that have been devoted to taking away the freedom and power that Little Brother excited in them to begin with.
Indeed, virtually everyone working on surveillance, ad-tech, or DRM started with the life-changing experience of discovering how code could project your will around the world, and how networks could set your mind free to wander the globe in search of likeminded communities.
And now, every day, they go to work making sure no one else will have that experience. Like all of us, they make a compromise, which begets a compromise, which begets yet another and another, and one day you find yourself working for Palantir or NSO Group.
Indeed, under conditions of monopoly capitalism, a sizeable fraction of us, in tech and out, spend our lives (and our money) furthering the interests of companies and states that are destroying those lives, and the planet too.
In the book, Masha thinks about this as a form of debt, like the "tech debt" that ever programmer has had to contend with: you take a shortcut, and then you have to prop it up in subsequent revisions, until the whole app is a teetering mess built on a crumbling foundation.
Like so many of us, Masha's moral debts have mounted and threaten catastrophic default. Attack Surface is the story of how she structures a bankruptcy that she can emerge from, transformed into a new and better person.
In his review, Greenberg talks with eminent human rights technologists about their own experience of the novel, and the tales he relates - many of which I read for the first time this morning - literally brought a tear of awesome, overwhelming joy and pride to my eye.
From Nathan Freitas, who put the book into the hands of every young technologist he met and then assigned it to his NYU ITP classes, where it found its way into the hands of Harlo Holmes, who calls it "fundamental to her origin story."
"It informed my thoughts around how privacy should work, the interplay between movement activists, technology and the law, and what you should look out for when inviting technologies into your life to do that movement building."
Today, Holmes is director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, teaching activists and journalists to resist foundation - the Foundation is also home to Securedrop, which Aaron Swartz helped create. Aaron wrote an afterword for Homeland, and took his own life shortly before its publication.
I toured that book haunted by his specter, telling his story as best as I could at every stop. Then, years later, I happened on some video shot at that time: Laura Poitras's Academy Award-winning documentary CITIZENFOUR.
Homeland gets a cameo there, as Edward Snowden is packing his go-bag while he hustles out of his Hong Kong hotel room, heading for a HK safehouse, a plane, and then, thanks to John Kerry's decision to cancel his passport midflight, to a long-term exile in Russia.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/ES_Homeland.gif"/&gt;
Greenberg quotes Snowden on the book: "He is to me a radical idealist, because no matter how bad things get, his mind goes to the stories of cooperation and creation-sharing.
"When the traditional structures of oppression are up to no good, as was the case in Little Brother, Cory doesn't reflexively indoctrinate young readers with platitudes on the inevitability of corruption. He helps them reimagine the limits of their own power."
And then Greenberg quotes my EFF colleague Eva Galpering, who, like Masha, is a brilliant security researcher raised by Soviet refugees: "This is a book for the people who realize that they've grown up and made a lot of compromises, and about how you turn back from that."
Eva is joining me on the Attack Surface Lectures, a series of eight events that start tomorrow night.
&lt;a href="https://read.macmillan.com/torforge/cory-doctorow-virtual-lecture-series/"&gt;https://read.macmillan.com/torforge/cory-doctorow-virtual-lecture-series/&lt;/a&gt;
Her remarks, and those of Greenberg's other sources, filled me with soaring joy this morning.
Even in the midst of my crushing, daily anxiety for the future of technology, the nations of my birth and residence, for my child and the planet she'll inherit, I was uplifted today.
These books of mine have gone far, thanks to readers like you. Today, with one day to go before Attack Surface's publication, I feel like, in some small way, I may have made a difference.

&lt;h1&gt;The herd immunity conspiracy (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/12/redeeming-hackers/#herd-immunity"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Thing about the "herd immunity" debate is, there isn't one. Herd immunity was discarded by WHO virologists and epidemiologists and their US/UK counterparts. So why are we still talking about it?
Thank right-wing think-tanks, awash in corporate money.
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jmfeldman/the-herd-immunity-strategy-isnt-part-of-a-scientific-debate-about-covid-19-abddf6bc7c13"&gt;https://medium.com/@jmfeldman/the-herd-immunity-strategy-isnt-part-of-a-scientific-debate-about-covid-19-abddf6bc7c13&lt;/a&gt;
The Hoover Institute and the American Institute for Economic Research have coordinated with the Trump administration to promote this idea. Hoover's Scott Atlas is on Trump's covid task force and his idea of scientific debate is threatening to sue scientists.
The majority of support for herd immunity comes from three scientists: Martin Kulldorff (Harvard Med), Sunetra Gupta (Oxford epidemiology) and theex-Hooverites Jay Bhattacharya (Stanford).
These three convened the meeting that produced the "Great Barrington Declaration" arguing for herd immunity - a declaration whose signatories include many obvious fakes ("Dr Johnny Bananas").
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/herd-immunity-letter-signed-fake-experts-dr-johnny-bananas-covid"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/herd-immunity-letter-signed-fake-experts-dr-johnny-bananas-covid&lt;/a&gt;
And these three are cited by GOP governors and local pols for their refusal to implement lockdowns, mask orders and other evidence-based, life-saving measures.
Like tobacco-cancer deniers of the fifties, they're selling doubt, and corporate-friendly politicians are buying.
Herd immunity is bad science, but it's good for business. Tossing low-waged workers into a viral meat-grinder "keeps the economy going" - which is to say, it keeps billionaires' fortunes intact.
Remember, if they need you to risk your life to make their fortunes, then you - not they - are the reason they have that fortune to begin with.

&lt;h1&gt;How to cheat at Clock Simulator (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/12/redeeming-hackers/#1pps"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Clock Simulator is a game that simulates being a clock. You have to click your mouse once per second, on the beat, to advance the second hand of a clock around a virtual clockface. The creator calls it a "minimalist rhythm game."
&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/501120/Clock_Simulator/"&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/501120/Clock_Simulator/&lt;/a&gt;
Now, if you want to rack up some really high Clock Simulator scores, you COULD spend hours at your mouse, tap-tap-tapping. But there's a better way to do it...with SCIENCE.
Best of all: it's a hardware hack.
Michael Dwyer's Clock Simulator hack feeds a GPS receiver's 1PPS (one pulse per second) function into a mouse for an unbeatable Clock Simulator high-score generator.

"Sure. You can probably do this with macro software. I think there's another guide for that. But this uses SATELLITES and ATOMIC CLOCKS, and is therefore many times cooler." -Dwyer

&lt;h1&gt;Someone Comes to Town, part 18 (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/12/redeeming-hackers/#scttslt"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The latest episode of my podcast is part 18 of my reading of my 2006 novel "Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town," a book that Gene Wolfe called "a glorious book unlike any book you’ve ever read."
&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/podcast/2020/10/12/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town-part-18/"&gt;https://craphound.com/podcast/2020/10/12/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town-part-18/&lt;/a&gt;
This week's episode comes with content warnings for spousal abuse, sexual violence and self-harm - and it also came with a kind of shock for me about how much my attitudes to how this kind of material should be presented in art have changed over the past ~15 years.
Here's how to catch up on previous installments:

&lt;h1&gt;Facebook vs The Big Lebowski (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/12/redeeming-hackers/#little-d"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Hans de Zwart is a digital rights activist - he used to run the Dutch campaigning group Bits of Freedom - who also happens to be a massive Big Lebowski fan. He created https://www.thebiglebow.ski, a search-engine for Lebowski quotes.
Things were fine until de Zwart started getting user complaints: they couldn't share content from his search engine on Facebook. They got this cryptic error: "Your message couldn’t be sent because it includes content that other people on Facebook have reported as abusive."
In an article for NRC, Reinier Kist recounts the bizarre, kafkaesque journey de Zwart embarked upon to find out why Facebook had classed quotes from The Big Lebowski as "abusive."
&lt;a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/08/03/the-dude-gedupeerd-door-big-tech-a4007753"&gt;https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/08/03/the-dude-gedupeerd-door-big-tech-a4007753&lt;/a&gt;
Every single thing about the story demonstrates Facebook's manifest unsuitability to be in charge of the social lives of 2.6B people.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;de Zwart couldn't even ask Facebook to look into it unless he created a FB account first&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FB wouldn't allow a lower-case "d" in "de Zwart" ("It is the arrogance of a giant American corporation which considers the correct spelling of the names of millions of Dutch people an edge case")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When de Zwart complained to FB, he got another cryptic message telling him not to expect a reply, but thanking him for "his experience"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then de Zwart registered as a FB advertiser and bought a EUR5 ad for his site, thinking that FB might listen to him if he paid them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad was rejected with this error: "this ad contains or refers to content that has been blocked by our security systems (#1885260)" (FB provides no way to look up error 1885260)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To question this, de Zwart had to agree to four unreadable, one-sided legal contracts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he did this, he got another terse message, thanking him for "helping us improve!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Zwart knew that FB - like all Big Tech companies - only ever corrects its mistakes when doing otherwise risks bad publicity.
So he pitched his story to Kist, who called up FB's PR office, and within days, the site was unblocked, with an apology for "the inconvenience." The only explanation? The site was misclassified by automated tools.
De Zwart has published an English translation of Kist's article. The subject matter is trivial, but the underlying message is frankly terrifying: our ability to talk with one another, organize and debate is in the hands of an uncaring giant.
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@hansdezwart/how-the-dude-was-duped-by-big-tech-f1311e097d1b"&gt;https://medium.com/@hansdezwart/how-the-dude-was-duped-by-big-tech-f1311e097d1b&lt;/a&gt;
FB is a company whose monopolistic scale means that it &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; moderate well, and also that it doesn't need to. What are you gonna do, use Instagram?
And despite this, regulators keep asking FB to do more automated filtering and more moderating.
They're bad at this. Really bad. When they do this, they end up censoring their users' legitimate speech, and the only people who get a hearing from them are people who know journalists who can threaten them with public humiliation.
If you want to create a fairer and less toxic online communications world, reduce Facebook's monopoly power - don't make them a permanent, incompetent, unaccountable privatized arm of the state.
Asking Mark Zuckerberg to do more of something he sucks at won't make him better at it - it'll just put his legion of traumatized, outsourced moderators on a hair trigger that results in far more dolphins caught in their tuna-nets.
And while famous, privileged and powerful people will be able to get their material sprung from content jail, the marginalized, poor and desperate will have no such access.
(de Zwart never got his 5 euros back)

&lt;h1&gt;Papercraft Haunted Mansion Hallowe'en (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/12/redeeming-hackers/#grim-grinning-ghosts"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
If you, like me, are missing the Haunted Mansion especially keenly as we pass through this all-too-short, stolen Decorative Gourd season with its rare confluence of an Oct 31 full moon on a Saturday night, Disney Imagineering has some comfort for you.

&lt;h1&gt;The Fifth Pig (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/18/fifth-pig/#5th-pig"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Fans of Al Jaffee are familiar with the concept of "fold-ins" - illustrations that transform with comic results after a bit of simple origami.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/PlentyLaughsPig.jpg"/&gt;
These aren't limited to MAD Magazine back covers, either. Sometimes they make their way into wartime propaganda.
&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/Fifthjackal1.jpg"/&gt;
A classic political fold-up is "where is the fifth pig" puzzles: four pigs in four quadrants, which, when folded, come together to reveal the fifth pig, Adolph Hitler. Several of these were distributed  by the British Special Operations Executive.

These were translated into other languages and also adapted for other leaders: a Dutch Hitler version, a Green Mussolini version, a jackal-to-Mussolini version. Some were airdropped by the RAF!
It's only fitting that we've got a Trump version, of course!

&lt;h1&gt;"Fuck the algorithm" (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/18/fifth-pig/#a-levels"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
High stakes tests serve no pedagogical purpose; however, they do serve an important &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; purpose, namely, they convert cash into the appearance of academic achievement.
Since scores on these tests can be improved through expensive prep, tests can be a way to preferentially advance the children of wealthy people without coming out and admitting that you don't want poor kids in the best schools.
Nowhere in the English-speaking world is this more true than in England, where the majority of secondary and even primary educational assessments are based entirely on tests - often a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; test for a whole year's grade.
I remember political scandals in the late Blair/early Brown period when a few select courses were to be evaluated based on "continuous assessment" - class work, teachers' rubrics, etc. This was deemed dangerously "subjective" and widely decried.
Enter the pandemic, which made it impossible for students to sit their A-level exams - these being the highest of the high-stakes tests, the key to admission to postsecondary institutions.
It's a darkly hilarious fact that your A-level grades aren't what get you into uni; offers are made based on your &lt;em&gt;predicted&lt;/em&gt; grade, which is based on your historical performance compared to other students at your school and your school's performance relative to rival schools.
But with huge data-voids left behind by the lockdown in the last school year, the Office of Qualifications (Ofqual, and yes, this is a real fucking thing) told teachers to just make up a grade that reflected their best guess.
It's the worst of both worlds: the "objective" measure ("how much did you pay to prepare for the exam?") is replaced with a "subjective" one ("does your teacher think you're smart?") with no formal rubric or framework.
But the Tories found a way to make this even worse. They created a black-box algorithm that then "adjusted" the teachers' estimated scores, giving upward nudges to students in exclusive private schools, and downgrading students in state schools.
This was justified by saying that it reflected the historical scores from each type of institution, which is so on-brand for Tories: on the one hand, it's an admission that the system exists to promote rich people.
And on the other, it implies that the reason to promote rich people is that they're just better - the toff's cod-eugenics that is perfectly in keeping with the idea of a hereditary aristocracy and monarchy.
But this was too ghastly for the Tories to get away with (a high bar to hurdle in 2020!), and, after students mobbed the Department of Education offices chanting "FUCK THE ALGORITHM" (yes, this also actually happened), the Tories reversed course.
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372045/uk-a-level-results-algorithm-biased-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-university-applications"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372045/uk-a-level-results-algorithm-biased-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-university-applications&lt;/a&gt;
This is nice, and I've got a warm schandeboris glow, but let's not lose sight of how &lt;em&gt;bonkers&lt;/em&gt; the whole high-stakes testing apparatus is.
Yes, it's great that we've got them to stop using phrenology to overtly discriminate against the poors, but let's dare to dream of a phrenology-free future, shall we?

&lt;h1&gt;Mr Cook, Tear Down That Wall (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/18/fifth-pig/#no-true-scotsman"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
You've probably heard that Fortnite publishers Epic are suing Apple over the right to sell software to Iphone owners without cutting Apple in for a 30% vig on every sale. Epic wants a court to order Apple to allow software vendors to offer direct sales.
Apple apologists insist that Apple should have the right to both lock its devices so that Apple customers can only get their software through the App Store, AND that Apple should be able to cream off 30% of every sale in the store.
There's been some smart commentary on this. In particular, I recommend Jay Freeman's long thread on whether the App Store is monopolistic (it most certainly is) and whether that's good for users or software developers (it most certainly is not).
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saurik/status/1295024384596312064"&gt;https://twitter.com/saurik/status/1295024384596312064&lt;/a&gt;
I've made my own contribution to the debate. In a new article for Slate's Future Tense, I talk about the role that interoperability could and should play in safeguarding user rights and blocking monopolistic conduct.
&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/08/epic-fortnite-apple-app-store-lawsuit-dmca.html"&gt;https://slate.com/technology/2020/08/epic-fortnite-apple-app-store-lawsuit-dmca.html&lt;/a&gt;
True believers in Apple's business model argue that Apple customers don't even WANT to buy software elsewhere (similar to how they argue against the Right to Repair by insisting that Apple customers are happy to be limited to getting repairs from Apple).
This is a frankly bizarre argument. Apple isn't spending millions are hiring entire buildings full of lawyers to block right to repair or independent app stores on general principle - the only reason to block these things is because you think your customers would use them.
As my EFF colleague Mitch Stoltz says, the argument that Apple users don't want flexibility is like the argument that the Berlin Wall isn't there to keep East Germans IN, it's there to keep the bourgeoisie out of the Worker's Paradise.
If the DDR really believed that people were happy to be behind the wall, they could easily test the proposition: just install a gate that anyone could pass through and see whether anyone stayed.
Likewise, if Apple's convinced that no one wants independent repair or third-party app stores with more dev-friendly policies, it can just put a gate in ITS walled garden and see what its customers do.
The Apple version of the "No True Scotsman" fallacy ("You're not a true Iphone owner if you object to the company you gave $1000 to for a phone charging software vendors a 30% commission") was always absurd.
But it would be fascinating to find out how many "true" Iphone users there are by those lights. If we were to allow owners of Iphones to treat them as their property, to use without regard to the shareholders of a $1T corporation, what would they do?
Apple probably won't unilaterally disarm its DRM arsenal. That's why EFF is suing the US government to overturn the law that makes it a crime to bypass DRM.

&lt;img src="https://craphound.com/images/leave-2731578_960_720.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Deindustrialization is a market failure (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/18/fifth-pig/#deindustrialization"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
In Rowan Moore Gerety's MIT Tech Review feature "Unmade in America," we get a vivid picture of how little industrial capacity remains in America and how much that has harmed the country's resilience to disasters and crises.
&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/14/1006428/unmade-in-america/"&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/14/1006428/unmade-in-america/&lt;/a&gt;
Gerety describes the mad scramble early in the crisis to manufacture PPP onshore, and the deep structural problems with doing so: America doesn't merely lack the machines to do this, it lacks the labs to test the materials, the people who know how to do the tests, and so on.
The entire pipeline is empty. The only people qualified to do the work are in their 70s, on the verge of retirement (some have retired since the crisis started). There are no people coming up behind them because deindustrialization means there's nowhere to train or practice.
From there, Gerety goes on the road with Jon Clark, a scrapper who's spent 30 years buying the equipment from closed factories and selling them overseas. Clark, more than anyone, has a bird's eye view of the literal demolishing of American industrial capacity.
These tangible phenomena reveal the invisible, intangible workings of the market system running beneath the surface: the 40 year neoliberal project that asserted that if it was profitable, it was sustainable.
The reason we can't make textiles onshore anymore is investors like Wilbur Ross, the (self described) billionaire who made his fortune buying up textile firms, shuttering them, and moving their production overseas.
These overseas operations are more profitable in part because the workers earn 10% of what their US counterparts take home - but also because the territories the factories relocated to had weak health, safety and environmental regs.
But economic orthodoxy holds that this is actually a net positive, that whatever problems arise from these transactions are offset by the gains.
Hayek's conception of the market as an aggregator of "information" from buyers and sellers insists that all of these downsides are "priced in" to the final outcome.
Garety goes over some of the funny math that "pricing in" uses: for example, if a TV factory shutters in the US and moves overseas, and TV prices fall from $1000 to $500, the net loss to America is $500 - but the town has lost $1,000 worth of work.
But the real funny math comes from the loss of reslience. Stripping America of its domestic capacity to create and maintain its infrastructure and vital supplies is a "negative externality" - a cost everyone bears, even as the investors behind the operation profit.
These costs are never priced into the market transaction, because the political system - which makes the rules of the market - allows those who incur them on all our behalf to act as though they don't exist.
Negative externailities are endemic to market systems: the CO2 that firms subject the rest of us to, the evictions that property speculation fuels, the national brittleness and weakness that offshoring creates.
These are features, not bugs, in "free market" capitalism.

&lt;h1&gt;Fed cops substitute dollars for warrants (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/18/fifth-pig/#ppp"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
The 1970s saw profound changes in US domestic surveillance. First, the Church Commission - fueled by the rampant abuses of the FBI in spying on political activists - radically curtailed the ability of domestic agencies to conduct surveillance without particularized suspicion.
But the credit bureaux - like Equifax and Experian - had massive growth spurts. Their origins lie in facilitating the systemic punishment of activists as well as sexual and racial minorities, so it's no surprise that they picked up the slack.
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/09/equifax-retail-credit-company-discrimination-loans"&gt;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/09/equifax-retail-credit-company-discrimination-loans&lt;/a&gt;
Today, data brokerages and official domestic surveillance have fused into a public-private partnership from hell. Consider "Babel Street," a shadowy location-data broker that buys your travel history from the apps you run on your phone.
Their big customers aren't just marketing firms: they're surveillance agencies like CBP and the Secret Service, who find writing a check to Babel Street to be an expedient, simple alternative to going before a judge with probable cause for a warrant.
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxk3g/secret-service-phone-location-data-babel-street"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxk3g/secret-service-phone-location-data-babel-street&lt;/a&gt;
Babel Street makes millions from these deals, and they will not answer any questions about them, not even to Ron Wyden, a member of the US Senate Intelligence Committee.
Wyden has proposed legislation to block government agencies from evading warrant requirements by paying companies like Babel Street to do their dirty work for them.

Hiktech is a Chinese surveillance-tech company that produces extraordinary, upbeat, cheerful comic ads about how great spying is.
For example in "After an Easy Prey," a medieval Chinese warlord calls upon a sorcerer with mysterious surveillance gadgets to track down a spy in his midst - it's like a cheerful, surveillance-oriented version of Jackie Chan's Drunken Master.

&lt;h1&gt;South Africa's copyright and human rights (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/18/fifth-pig/#3-steps"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
South Africa is in the midst of a major overhaul to its copyright system, in particular the "limitations and exceptions" that are the escape valves within copyright for such core human rights as free expression and self-determination.
Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to copyright exceptions: "enumerated uses" (lists of things you're allowed to do) and "frameworks" (criteria that judges can use to assess whether a use should be allowed).
Examples of the "enumerated uses" system are the UK fair dealing system, or the EU Copyright Directive's guarantee of a "criticism" and "parody" exemption.
While the "frameworks" approach is in use in the US through "fair use," as well as in the copyright systems of Israel, South Korea and other countries.
Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Enumerated exemptions provide certainty by listing things you are absolutely allowed to do. Frameworks are future-proof, allowing courts to reason about uses that were not technologically possible when the law was created.
To its credit, South Africa adopted both: a set of enumerated exemptions to reflect the state of the art, and a straightforward importation of the US fair use "four factor" framework for new uses.
And to its shame, the US Trade Rep took the bizarre position that South Africa was not &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; to have fair use, claiming that this would violate SA's international trade obligations under the Berne Convention, TRIPS, the WCT, etc.
This is obviously wrong. For one thing, the US itself is party to all these same treaties, and it has never faced enforcement action for its fair use rules. If fair use was incompatible with these treaties, it would have faced a challenge.
But despite both domestic and overseas NGOs pointing this out, SA President Cyril Ramaphosa has sent the copyright bill back to parliament, having stripped it of &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the exemptions and fair use, claiming it would violate the Berne Convention.
Yesterday, EFF sent an open letter to the Parliament and the President with extensive legal citations to show that South Africa will not be in breach of its international obligations if it creates a fair use system.

As I explain in the accompanying blog post, exemptions for education, research, archiving, libraries and museums are critical to the human rights of the South African people and the national and economic sovereignty of the South African nation.

&lt;h1&gt;Gig workers around the globe (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/22/kropotkin-graeber/#an-injury-to-one"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
My 2010 YA science fiction novel For the Win imagines a global solidarity movement among precarious gig workers paid to "gold farm" inside massively multiplayer online games.
&lt;a href="https://craphound.com/category/ftw/"&gt;https://craphound.com/category/ftw/&lt;/a&gt;
The kids who do this work realize they have more in common with each other than their bosses, and form a global syndicalist union called the Industrial Workers of the World Wide Web (IWWW) or "Webblies."
Gold farming remains a source of exploitative labor, xenophobic in-game violence, and acts of solidarity, but it's only a tiny sliver of the true gig economy, which started with traditional low-waged delivery and driving work and has spread to MDs.
&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/21/1018915121/video-gaming-the-system"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2021/07/21/1018915121/video-gaming-the-system&lt;/a&gt;
"The Global Gig Workers" is a new, important report on the gig economy around the world, published by Rest of World. It's grounded in a survey of 4,500 gig workers in 15 countries, backstopped by seven profiles of workers in seven countries.
&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/"&gt;https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/&lt;/a&gt;
The package includes a dive into the small coterie of investors that are behind the drive to export the gig economy to every nation on earth, delving into how they describe the business opportunity gig work represents.
&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-investors-behind-gig-work-model/"&gt;https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-investors-behind-gig-work-model/&lt;/a&gt;
It won't surprise you to learn that what attracts investors to gig work is the potential to scale up a company at workers' expense. Building the app and bribing, coercing or convincing local authorities to allow it to operate is a fixed cost; running the service is cheap.
The capital costs - bikes, trucks, cars, phones, data-plans - are all borne by workers, who, thanks to systematic worker misclassification, are treated as independent contractors who are not entitled to benefits or workplace protection.
And while the workers must buy expensive capital equipment and have their days scripted to a fine degree by the electronic nag of the app, the company offers them no assurance that compliance and performance will be rewarded with a fair wage.
Not only do workers routinely see their pay slashed after they've established themselves with the company, thanks to unilateral shifts in the compensation structure (as well as changes to the apps to hide how much a job pays until the worker has completed it).
But entire, debt-financed capital investments by workers can be wiped out by a "pivot" in corporate strategy, as happened to Zweli Ngwenya, an Uber driver in Johannesburg who went into debt to buy a car that qualified him to drive for Uberx.
Ngwenya relied on Uberx-style compensation to service the debt on the capital asset he purchased to help Uber scale up its South African business. But then Uber rolled out a cheaper alternative, Uber Go, that didn't require a fancy car, and paid lower compensation.
Ngwenya's wages have "plummeted." He may not be able to service the debt he incurred. A company that expected him to frog whenever its app told him to jump never extended even the thinnest fiction of a reciprocal  degree of respect and care.
There's a lot to be learned from Rest of World's data analysis. For example, there's an excellent article on "How the platform economy sets women up to fail," which traces the gender inequities in the structure of the gig economy.
&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-how-platforms-set-women-up-to-fail/"&gt;https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-how-platforms-set-women-up-to-fail/&lt;/a&gt;
But what I found most fascinating was the introductory article, "How the gig workers are fighting back," detailing how gig workers around the world are making common cause with one another.
&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/gig-workers-around-the-world-are-finally-organizing/"&gt;https://restofworld.org/2021/gig-workers-around-the-world-are-finally-organizing/&lt;/a&gt;
These movements cross sectors - uniting drivers and bike deliverers and grocery shoppers - and national boundaries, as well as the far less permeable barriers between high-income and low-income countries.
Because even though there are striking differences between the lives of the seven gig workers profiled in the package - a doctor in India, a truck driver in Indonesia, a rideshare driver in Ethiopia - the similarities are even more striking.
Even though these workers can articulate benefits to their situation, they all describe the same pathology of their implacable app overlords - a steady ramping-up of work to a dangerous  inhuman pace, a race to the bottom from app companies promising faster, cheaper service.
The same pattern is repeated around the globe. Josh Dzieza's beautifully written longread on the lives of NYC bike-delivery couriers repeats all the themes of these workers around the global south.
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps&lt;/a&gt;
Like my imaginary Webblies, these workers are facing a common enemy, and they're banding together online to fight back. What's more, these workers are canaries in the labor coalmine: if your job can be done by zoom, some asshole is currently pitching that  business-plan.
Teachers, lawyers, doctors, illustrators, writers - the gig economy is everyone's future - it's just not evenly distributed. Whether you're ordering dinner from an app or delivering it, you have a common enemy in the form of rapacious, inhumane global capital.
But it doesn't have to be this way. These businesses don't need to operate at inhumane tempo to be viable. They don't need to offload capital costs to workers. They don't need to misclassify employees and escape fair workplace standards. We let them do it, so they do it.
We can stop them. The beneficiaries of the gig economy are few. Its victims are many. The same tools that offer instantaneous, globe-spanning exploitation can also be a framework for global, realtime solidarity movements.

&lt;img alt="The cover of the illustrated PM Press edition of Peter Kropotkin's 'Mutual Aid,' featuring an introduction by David Graeber." src="https://craphound.com/images/large_1185_mutualaidcover.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mutual Aid and David Graeber (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/22/kropotkin-graeber/#against-just-so"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Peter Kropotkin was a Russian aristocrat who renounced his titles, became a scientist and anarchist, and wrote many significant works, but none so important as MUTUAL AID, his 1902 treatise on the role of cooperation in evolutionary biology.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution&lt;/a&gt;
Originally intended as a series of (never delivered) lectures for William Morris's Socialist League, the book was an assault on "moral philosophers" who used Darwin's work and "survival of the fittest" to justify class oppression at home and imperial slaughter abroad.
Painstaking researched and beautifully argued, MUTUAL AID reveals the scientific fraud of "social Darwinism," and its claims that hierarchy and exploitation are evolutionary inevitabilities baked into our very nature.
And while Kropotkin's ideas have inspired generations of biologists AND activists, the social Darwinists have only grown in influence, providing pseudoscientific cover for greed, oppression and immorality.
The folks at PM Press have just published a stunning, illustrated new edition of MUTUAL AID, illustrated by N.O. Bonzo whose neo-Arts-and-Crafts marginalia and full-page spreads are gorgeous and thrilling
&lt;a href="https://www.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=1185"&gt;https://www.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=1185&lt;/a&gt;
Still better are the essays that have been incorporated for this edition: a foreword by Ruth Kinna, a preface by GATS, an afterword by Allan Antliff, and, miraculously, a scorching and blazing introduction by Allan Antliff and the late, lamented David Graeber (Rest In Power).
Graeber and Antliff's essay zeroes in on the social function of social Darwinism - identifying the way that it creates a state of "capitalist realism" where there is no alternative, thanks to "human nature."
I am still sorrowing over David's death, and finding a new work by him, so trenchant and on-point, was exhilarating, even glorious.
If critiques of social Darwinism and evolutionary psychology are your thing, I &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; recommend feminist biologist Anne Dagg's incandescent 2004 book, LOVE OF SHOPPING IS NOT A GENE.
&lt;a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2009/11/04/love-of-shopping-is-not-a-gene-exposing-junk-science-and-ideology-in-darwinian-psychology/"&gt;https://memex.craphound.com/2009/11/04/love-of-shopping-is-not-a-gene-exposing-junk-science-and-ideology-in-darwinian-psychology/&lt;/a&gt;
Kropotkin was a scientist, but he trained as a geographer and biology was more of a hobby. By contrast, Dagg is a prominent and celebrated biologist and her critique has an unmistakable scientific heft mixed with a righteous fury.
In the meantime, this new PM edition of MUTUAL AID could not be more timely, beautiful or on-point. It's a superb volume.

&lt;a name="zuckerveganism"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="Mark Zuckerberg onstage, speaking in front of a large stock-report chart that shows a descending line, captioned with a Facebook 'Delete My Account' button." src="https://craphound.com/images/2696198607_a6f3f7cd02_o-1-1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Facebook algorithm boosts pro-Facebook news (&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/22/kropotkin-graeber/#zuckerveganism"&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
Facebook is a rotten company, rotten from the top down, its founder, board and top execs are sociopaths and monsters, committers of non-hyperbolic, no-fooling crimes against humanity. They lie, they cheat, they steal. They are some of history's greatest villains.
Because Facebook is a terrible company run by terrible people, it periodically erupts in ghastly scandal. Sometimes whistleblowers or reporters reveal historic crimes, including (but not limited to) deliberately helping to foment genocide.
Sometimes, the scandals are contemporary: either Facebook blithely announces it's going to do something terrible, or we learn of some terrible thing underway from leaks or investigations.
Thanks to a history of anticompetitive mergers - Whatsapp, Instagram, Onavo and more - based on fraudulent promises to antitrust regulators, Facebook has grown to nearly three billion users - except FB doesn't have users, really - it has hostages.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/dont-believe-proven-liars-absolute-minimum-standard-prudence-merger-scrutiny"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/dont-believe-proven-liars-absolute-minimum-standard-prudence-merger-scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;
As Facebook's own internal memos show, the company doesn't just buy up competitors so users have nowhere to flee to, it also engineers in high "switching costs" to make it more painful to leave the system.
&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs&lt;/a&gt;
For example, Facebook's internal memos show that the manager for its photo products set out to seduce users into entrusting FB with their family photos, because that way quitting Facebook would mean abandoning your memories of your kids, departed grandparents, etc.
Everybody hates Facebook, especially FB users. The point of high switching costs, after all, is to increase the pain of leaving so that FB can dole out more abuse to its users without fearing that they'll quit the whole enterprise.
FB's mission is to increase the size of the shit-sandwich they can force you to eat before you walk away. But they're not mere sadists: shit-sandwiches have  a business model: the more hostages they take, the more they can extract from advertisers - their true customers.
The polite term for what FB has is a "two-sided market" (selling advertisers to users and users to advertisers). The technical term is "a monopoly and a monoposony" (a monopsony is a market with a single buyer).
The colloquial term?
"A racket."
A scam. A bezzle. A blight.
Facebook gouges advertisers on rate cards, then lies about the reach of its ads (like when it lied about the popularity of video, evincing a media-wide "pivot to video" that bankrupted dozens of news- and entertainment-sites).
Facebook didn't set out to destroy journalism by price-fixing ads, lying to advertisers and media outlets.
FB set out to acquire a monopoly and extract monopoly rents from advertisers and publishers, with a pathological indifference to how these frauds would harm others.
Having shown a willingness to destroy journalists and media outlets to extract a few more billions for its shareholders, Facebook has attracted a lot of enemies in the media.
If you're a whistleblower with a story to tell, there's a journalist whose editor will allocate the resources to report your story out in depth. The combination of a rotten company and a lot of pissed off journalists produces a lot of bad ink for the company.
But the fact remains that FB has a vast pool of hostages, billions of them, and it gets to decide what they see, when and how. I used to joke with my human rights activist friends that the best use for Facebook was showing people why and how to leave Facebook.
FB's response was predictable. As Ryan Mac and Sheera Frenkel write in the New York Times, FB's Project Amplify is a Zuckerberg-led initiative to systematically promote positive coverage of FB and its founder - including articles that originate with FB itself.
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-project-amplify.html"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-project-amplify.html&lt;/a&gt;
That is, FB staffers are charged with writing puff pieces about how great the company is, and FB's algorithm will push these ahead of reporting by actual journalists who present detailed, factual, multi-sourced accounts of the company's fraudulent and depraved conduct.
Project Amplify marks a pivot from FB's longstanding policy of issuing insincere apologies for its scandals. Company sources told the reporters that everyone figured out these don't convince anyone, so the company turned to pushing happy-talk quackspeak instead.
One of the leaders of this project is Alex Schultz, "a 14-year company veteran who was named chief marketing officer last year," but the major impetus comes from Zuck himself, one of the most hated men on the planet.
Amplify is just one of FB's strategies for distorting the discourse about itself. In July, it neutered Crowdtangle, an widely used analytics tool that showed that FB's top posts were unhinged far-right disinformation and conspiracies.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/15/three-wise-zucks-in-a-trenchcoat/#inconvenient-truth"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/15/three-wise-zucks-in-a-trenchcoat/#inconvenient-truth&lt;/a&gt;
And Facebook has declared all-out legal warfare (accompanied by a disinformation campaign) to kill Adobserver, an NYU project that tracks paid political disinformation on the platform.
&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#quis-custodiet-ipsos-zuck"&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#quis-custodiet-ipsos-zuck&lt;/a&gt;
By shutting down Crowdtangle and Adobserver, FB hopes to control the academic findings about the company's role in disinformation, hate, and harassment. The company runs its own research portal where academics are expected to access data about the platform.
But as with the journalists who report on it, FB has heaped abuse on the academics who research it.
Its portal data was bad, leaving PhD and masters' theses are at risk of retraction. Mid-dissertation researchers have been set back to square one.
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions#facebook-sent-flawed-data-to-misinformation-researchers"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions#facebook-sent-flawed-data-to-misinformation-researchers&lt;/a&gt;
In retrospect, Facebook's decision to game its own algorithm to push pro-company quackspeak seems inevitable. It's not just that no one believes the company's apologies anymore (if they ever did) - it's that  the company seems incapable of hiring competent spin doctors.
Take the WSJ's blockbuster "Facebook Files," a series of reports detailing the company's willingness to harm children, commit fraud, and allow millions of favored, powerful people to violate its rules with impunity.
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-16/facebook-s-promised-to-gain-the-public-s-trust"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-16/facebook-s-promised-to-gain-the-public-s-trust&lt;/a&gt;
FB's response was genuinely pathetic. In a perfunctory blog post, its top flack - the widely despised British politician Nick Clegg, paid millions to front FB on the global stage - vilified the WSJ's reporting without producing any factual rebuttals.
&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/what-the-wall-street-journal-got-wrong/"&gt;https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/what-the-wall-street-journal-got-wrong/&lt;/a&gt;
It's the kind of ham-fisted policy advocacy that Facebook is (in)famous for. Who can forget the absolute shitshow in India over its Internet Basics program, when it bribed telcos to exempt FB and the services it hand-picked from their data-caps?
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-free-basics-india-zuckerberg"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-free-basics-india-zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;
This Net-Neutracidal maneuver, falsely billed as a way to bring the internet to poor people (something is absolutely does not do), was the subject of a consultation by India's telco regulators.
FB pushed deceptive alerts to millions of its Indian users, tricking them into sending a flood of form-letters to the regulator urging it to leave Internet Basics intact.
But whoever drafted the form letter didn't bother to check whether it addressed any of the questions the regulator was consulting on. That made these millions of letters non-responsive to the consultation, so the regulator ignored them.
FB lost! It's almost as though people who are good at fighting policy battles don't want to work for Facebook, and the only talent they can attract are the kinds of opportunistic knob-ends that no one takes seriously and everyone hates.
Weird, that.
